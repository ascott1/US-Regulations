                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2002), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

limited to, the following:
    Example 1: Method to give priority to a limited number of sites. 
Based on data from the preceding fiscal year--
    (a) First, a local educational agency ranks each site based on the 
percentage of the site's total enrollment of students who are members of 
special populations.
    (b) Second, the local educational agency establishes a funding cut-
off point for sites above the district-wide percentage of special 
populations enrollment. The local educational agency funds sites above 
the cut-off point but does not fund sites below that point.
    Example 2: Method to give priority to a limited number of program 
areas. Based on data from the preceding fiscal year--
    (a) First, a postsecondary institution ranks each program area based 
on the percentage of the program area's total enrollment of students who 
are members of special populations.
    (b) Second, the postsecondary institution establishes a funding cut-
off point for program areas that rank above the institution-wide average 
percentage of special populations enrollment. The postsecondary 
institution funds projects in a program area that is above the cut-off 
point but does not fund projects in program areas below that point.
    Example 3: Method to give priority to a limited number of sites. 
Based on data from the preceding fiscal year--
    (a) First, an LEA or postsecondary institution identifies a site 
with a high concentration of special populations;
    (b) Second, the LEA or postsecondary institution identifies a 
program area at the site (such as health occupations) in which the 
participation rate for members of special populations has been lower 
than the overall rate of participation for members of special 
populations at the site; and

[[Page 46]]

    (c) Third, the LEA or postsecondary institution funds a project at 
the site designed to improve the participation rate of members of 
special populations in that program area.
    Note to examples in Sec. 403.111: Absolute counts of special 
population members may be used to determine the sites or program areas 
with the highest concentrations of special population members instead 
of, or in combination with, percentages of special population members.
    (c) Funds made available from an award under Sec. 403.112, 
Sec. 403.113, or Sec. 403.116 must be used to provide vocational 
education in programs that--
    (1) Are of sufficient size, scope, and quality as to be effective;
    (2) Integrate academic and vocational education in those programs 
through coherent sequences of courses so that students achieve both 
academic and occupational competencies; and
    (3) Provide for the equitable participation of members of special 
populations in vocational education consistent with the assurances and 
requirements in Secs. 403.190(b) and 403.193, so that these populations 
have an opportunity to enter vocational education that is equal to that 
afforded to the general student population.

    (d) In carrying out the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
an eligible recipient under Secs. 403.112, 403.113, or Sec. 403.116 may 
use funds for activities that include, but are not limited to--
    (1) Upgrading of curriculum;
    (2) Purchase of equipment, including instructional aids;
    (3) Inservice training of both vocational instructors and academic 
instructors working with vocational education students for integrating 
academic and vocational education;
    (4) Guidance and counseling;
    (5) Remedial courses;
    (6) Adaptation of equipment;
    (7) Tech-prep education programs;
    (8) Supplementary services designed to meet the needs of special

must be a qualified counselor or teacher, to ensure that individuals who 
are members of special populations are receiving adequate services and 
job skill training;
    (10) Apprenticeship programs;
    (11) Programs that are strongly tied to economic development efforts 
in the State;
    (12) Programs that train adults and students for all aspects of an 
occupation in which job openings are projected or available;
    (13) Comprehensive mentor programs in institutions of higher 
education offering comprehensive programs in teacher preparation, which 
seek to use fully the skills and work experience of individuals 
currently or formerly employed in business and industry who are 
interested in becoming classroom instructors and to meet the need of 
vocational educators who wish to upgrade their teaching competencies; or
    (14) Provision of education and training through arrangements with 
private vocational training institutions, private postsecondary 
educational institutions, employers, labor organizations, and joint 
labor-management apprenticeship programs if those institutions, 
employers, labor organizations, or programs can make a significant 
contribution to obtaining the objectives of the State plan and can 
provide substantially equivalent training at a lesser cost, or can 
provide equipment or services not available in public institutions.

Sec. 403.112  How does a State allocate funds under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program to local educational agencies?

    (a) Reservation of funds. From the portion of its allotment under 
Sec. 403.180(b)(1) for the basic programs, each fiscal year a State may 
reserve funds for the Secondary School Vocational Education Program.
    (b) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section and Sec. 401.119, a State shall distribute funds reserved 
for the Secondary School Vocational Education Program to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) according to the following formula:
    (1) From 70 percent of the amount reserved, an LEA must be allocated 
an amount that bears the same relationship to the 70 percent as the 
amount

[[Page 47]]

the LEA was allocated under section 1005 of chapter 1 (20 U.S.C. 2711) 
in the fiscal or program year preceding the fiscal or program year in 
which the allocation is made bears to the total amount received under 
section 1005 of chapter 1 by all LEAs in the State in that preceding 
year.
    (2) From 20 percent of the amount reserved, an LEA must be allocated 
an amount that bears the same relationship to the 20 percent as the 
number of students with disabilities who have individualized education 
programs under section 614(a)(5) of the IDEA served by the LEA in the 
fiscal or program year preceding the fiscal or program year in which the 
allocation is made bears to the total number of those students served by 
all LEAs in the State in that preceding year.
    (3) From 10 percent of the amount reserved, an LEA must be allocated 
an amount that bears the same relationship to the 10 percent as the 
number of students enrolled in schools and adults enrolled in vocational 
education training programs under the jurisdiction of the LEA in the 
fiscal or program year preceding the fiscal or program year in which the 
allocation is made bears to the number of students enrolled in schools 
in kindergarten through 12th grade and adults enrolled in vocational 
education training programs under the jurisdiction of all LEAs in the 
State in that preceding year.

    Example: Assume that a State has reserved $5,000,000 of its basic 
programs funds under Title II of the Act for secondary school programs.
    (a)(1) All LEAs in the State were allocated a total of $80,000,000 
under section 1005 of Chapter 1 in the preceding fiscal year. Of that 
amount, school district ``A'' was allocated $400,000.
    (2) The allocation for school district ``A'' is calculated by 
multiplying $3,500,000 (70 percent of $5,000,000) by .005 of the State 
total ($400,000/$80,000,000). The allocation for school district ``A'' 
would be $17,500 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (b)(1) All LEAs in a State served a total of 100,000 students with 
disabilities who have individualized education programs under section 
614(a)(5) of the IDEA in the preceding fiscal year. Of that total, 
school district ``A'' served 400 of those students in the preceding 
fiscal year.
    (2) The allocation for school district ``A'' is calculated by 
multiplying $1,000,000 (20 percent of $5,000,000) by .004 of the State 
total (400/100,000). The allocation for school district ``A'' would be 
$4,000 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c)(1) All LEAs in a State enrolled a total of 1,000,000 students 
(including adults enrolled in vocational education training programs in 
those LEAs) in the preceding fiscal year. Of that number school district 
``A'' enrolled 3,500 of those students in the preceding fiscal year.
    (2) The allocation for school district ``A'' is calculated by 
multiplying 500,000 (10 percent of $5,000,000) by .0035 of the State 
total (3,500/1,000,000). The allocation for school district ``A'' would 
be $1,750 under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

    (c) Exception to the general rule. In applying the provisions in 
paragraph (b) of this section, a State may not distribute funds to an 
LEA that operates only elementary schools, but shall instead distribute 
funds that would have been allocated for those ineligible LEAs as 
follows:
    (1) If an LEA that operates only elementary schools sends its 
graduating students to a single local or regional educational agency 
that provides secondary school services to secondary school students in 
the same attendance area, a State shall distribute to that local or 
regional educational agency any amounts under paragraph (b) of this 
section that would otherwise have been allocated to LEAs operating only 
elementary schools.
    (2) If an LEA that operates only elementary schools sends its 
graduating students to two or more local or regional educational 
agencies that provide secondary school services to secondary students in 
the same attendance area, the State shall distribute to those local or 
regional educational agencies an amount based on the proportionate 
number of students each agency received in the previous year from the 
LEA that operates only elementary schools.
    (d)(1) Minimum grant amount. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section, an LEA is not eligible for a grant under the Secondary 
School Vocational Education Program unless the amount allocated to the 
LEA under paragraph (b) of this section is not less than $15,000.
    (2)(i) An LEA may enter into a consortium with one or more LEAs for 
the purpose of providing services under the

[[Page 48]]

Secondary School Vocational Education Program in order to meet the 
minimum grant requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) A consortium arrangement under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section must serve primarily as a structure for operating joint projects 
that provide services to all participating local educational agencies.
    (iii) A project operated by a consortium must meet the size, scope, 
and quality requirement of Sec. 403.111(c)(1).

    Example: Under the distribution formula for the Secondary School 
Vocational Education Program, three LEAs earn $5,000 each (which is less 
than the $15,000 minimum grant amount for each LEA). The LEAs form a 
consortium in order to receive an award. One of the LEAs is designated 
as the fiscal agent for the consortium and receives the $15,000 award 
for the consortium. The consortium may operate and fund with the $15,000 
a project or projects for the benefit of all participating LEAs. The 
fiscal agent of the consortium may not subgrant back to the 
participating LEAs the amounts they contributed to the consortium.

    (3) A State may waive paragraph (d)(1) of this section in any case 
in which the LEA--
    (i) Is located in a rural, sparsely populated area;
    (ii) Demonstrates that it is unable to enter into a consortium for 
purposes of providing services under the Secondary School Vocational 
Education Program; and
    (iii) Demonstrates that the projects to be assisted meet the size, 
scope, and quality requirements in Sec. 403.111(c)(1).
    (4) Any amounts that are not distributed by reason of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section must be redistributed in accordance with the 
provisions in paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 403.113  How does a State allocate funds under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program to area vocational education schools and intermediate 
          educational agencies?

    (a) A State shall distribute funds reserved under Sec. 403.112(a) 
directly to the appropriate area vocational education school or 
intermediate educational agency in any case in which--
    (1) The area vocational education school or intermediate educational 
agency and an LEA--
    (i) Have formed or will form a consortium for the purpose of 
receiving funds reserved under Sec. 403.112(a); or
    (ii) Have entered into or will enter into a cooperative arrangement 
for the purpose of receiving funds reserved under Sec. 403.112(a); and
    (2)(i) The area vocational education school or intermediate 
educational agency serves a proportion of students with disabilities and 
students who are economically disadvantaged that is approximately equal 
to or greater than the proportion of those students attending the 
secondary schools under the jurisdiction of all of the LEAs sending 
students to the area vocational education school or the intermediate 
educational agency; or
    (ii) The area vocational education school or intermediate 
educational agency demonstrates that it is unable to meet the criterion 
in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section due to the lack of interest by 
students with disabilities and students who are economically 
disadvantaged in attending vocational education programs in that area 
vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.
    (b) If an area vocational education school or intermediate 
educational agency meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, then the amount that would otherwise be allocated to the LEA 
may be distributed to the area vocational education school, the 
intermediate educational agency, and the LEA--
    (1) Based on each school's or entity's relative share of students 
with disabilities and students who are economically disadvantaged who 
are attending vocational education programs that meet the requirements 
of Sec. 403.111 (based, if practicable, on the average enrollment for 
the prior 3 years); or
    (2) On the basis of an agreement between the LEA and the area 
vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and 
Secs. 403.114 and 403.115, prior to distributing funds to any LEA that 
would receive an allocation that is not sufficient to conduct

[[Page 49]]

a program that meets the requirements of Sec. 403.111(c), a State shall 
encourage the LEA to--
    (1) Form a consortium or enter a cooperative agreement with an area 
vocational education school or intermediate educational agency offering 
programs that meet the requirements of Sec. 403.111(c), and that are 
accessible to economically disadvantaged students and students with 
disabilities that would be served by the LEA; and
    (2) Transfer its allocation to an area vocational education school 
or intermediate educational agency.
    (d) If an LEA's allocation under Sec. 403.112 meets the minimum 
grant requirement in Sec. 403.112(d), and the allocation is distributed 
in part to an area vocational education school or an intermediate 
educational agency pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
the LEA may retain the amount not distributed to the area vocational 
education school or an intermediate educational agency even though that 
amount is less than the minimum grant required by Sec. 403.112(d).

<R05>
Sec. 403.114  How does a State determine the number of economically disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs under the Secondary School 
          Vocational Education Program?

    (a) For the purposes of Sec. 403.113, a State may determine the 
number of economically disadvantaged students attending vocational 
education programs on any of the following bases:
    (1) Eligibility for one of the following:
    (i) Free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Act 
(42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.).
    (ii) The program for aid to Families with Dependent Children under 
part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601).
    (iii) Benefits under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011).
    (iv) To be counted for purposes of section 1005 of chapter 1.
    (v) Participation in programs assisted under title II of the JTPA.
    (2) Receipt of a Pell grant or assistance under a comparable State 
program of need-based financial assistance.
    (3) Status of an individual who is determined by the Secretary to be 
low-income according to the latest available data from the Department of 
Commerce or the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty 
Guidelines.
    (4) Other indices of economic status, including estimates of those 
indices, if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary 
that those indices are more representative of the number of economically 
disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs. The 
Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether other indices of 
economic status are more representative of the number of economically 
disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs, taking 
into consideration, for example, the statistical reliability of any data 
submitted by a grantee as well as the general acceptance of the indices 
by other agencies in the State or local area.
    (b) If a State elects to use more than one factor described in 
paragraph (a) of this section for purposes of determining the number of 
economically disadvantaged students enrolled in vocational education 
programs, the State shall ensure that the data used are not duplicative.

Sec. 403.115  What appeal procedures must be established under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program?

    The State board shall establish an appeals procedure for resolution 
of any dispute arising between an LEA and an area vocational education 
school or an intermediate educational agency with respect to the 
allocation procedures described in Secs. 403.112 and 403.113, including 
the decision of an LEA to leave a consortium.

Sec. 403.117  What definitions apply to the Postsecondary and Adult Vocational Education Programs?

    For the purposes of Secs. 403.116, 403.118, and 403.120 the 
following definitions apply:
    (a) Eligible institution means an institution of higher education, 
an LEA serving adults, or an area vocational education school serving 
adults that offers or will offer a program that meets the requirements 
of Sec. 403.111 and seeks to receive assistance under Sec. 403.116.
    (b)(1) Institution of higher education means an educational 
institution in any State that--
    (i) Admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of 
graduation from a school providing secondary education, or the 
recognized equivalent of that certificate, or who are beyond the age of

    (ii) Is legally authorized within the State to provide a program of 
education beyond secondary education;
    (iii) Provides an educational program for which it awards a 
bachelor's degree or provides not less than a two-year program which is 
acceptable for full credit toward such a degree, or in the case of a 
hospital or health care facility, that provides training of not less

leading to a degree or certificate upon completion of that training;
    (iv) Is a public or other nonprofit institution; and
    (v) Is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or 
association approved by the Secretary for this purpose or, if not so 
accredited--
    (A) Is an institution with respect to which the Secretary has 
determined that there is satisfactory assurance, considering the 
resources available to the institution, the period of time, if any, 
during which it has operated, the effort it is making to meet

provided by schools in that category, that must--
    (i) Prescribe the standards of content, scope, and quality that must 
be met in order to qualify schools in that category to participate in 
the program pursuant to this part; and

year for which a State submits to the Secretary an application for such 
a waiver that--
    (a) Demonstrates that the formula in Sec. 403.116(b)(2) does not 
result in a distribution of funds to the institutions or consortia of 
eligible institutions within the State that have the highest numbers of

    (1) If the five percent reserved for administration is less than the

Program in Sec. 403.91, or the Program for Criminal Offenders in 
Sec. 403.101, respectively, is less than the amount reserved for that 
program in FY 1990 (funds from the FY 1990 appropriation awarded in the 
States FY 1991 grant), a State shall subtract any amount necessary to 
satisfy the $250,000 minimum for State administration or any of the 
``hold-harmless'' amounts from the total basic programs award received 
by the State.
    (2) The State shall reserve $250,000 for administration and shall 
reserve for any program not meeting the ``hold-harmless'' requirement an 
amount necessary to meet that requirement.
    (3) The State shall reserve from the remainder of the basic program 
award an amount for each of the remaining programs that is proportionate 
to the amount that program would have received in the absence of a 
shortfall in the amounts reserved for administration or to meet the 
``hold-harmless'' requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    Example 1: (a) A State receives a basic programs award of 
$4,000,000. Five percent of the basic programs award equals $200,000, 
which is $50,000 less than the $250,000 minimum that may be reserved for 
State administration. To determine the amount of funds that will be 
reserved for each program under title II, parts A, B, and C of the Act, 
the State first subtracts $250,000 for State administration from the 
$4,000,000 basic programs award ($4,000,000 -$250,000 = $3,750,000).
    (b) Second, the State determines the amount that would have been 
reserved for each of the programs under title II, parts A, B, and C of 
the Act in the absence of a shortfall in the set-aside amount for 
administration, as follows:

3.0% x$4,000,000 =                $120,000  for Sex Equity Programs.
7.5% x$4,000,000 =                 300,000  for Programs for Single
                                             Parents, Displaced
                                             Homemakers, and Single
                                             Pregnant Women.
8.5% x$4,000,000 =                 340,000  for State Programs and State
                                             Leadership Activities.

    (c) Third, the State converts each of these amounts into a 
percentage by dividing each amount by the sum of the amounts the 
programs would have received in the absence of a shortfall ($3,800,000) 
and multiplies the remaining basic programs award ($3,750,000) by these 
percentages to determine the amount to reserve for each program under 
parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act, as follows:

($120,000/$3,800,000)             $118,421  for Sex Equity Programs.
 x$3,750,000 =
($300,000/$3,800,000)              296,053  for Programs for Single

    This example assumes that amounts reserved meet the ``hold-
harmless'' requirement of section 102(c)(1) of the Act.

    Example 2: A State's seven percent reserve from its FY 1992 grant 
for the Program for Single Parents, Displaced Homemakers, and Single 
Pregnant Women is $1,400,000 and the amount reserved for that program 
from its FY 1991 grant was $1,581,000. Therefore, the amount of FY 1992 
funds reserved for that program is $181,000 less than the amount 
reserved in FY 1991. The State received a basic programs award of 
$20,000,000 in FY 1992. The other programs under title II, part B meet 
the ``hold-harmless'' requirement in Sec. 403.180(a)(1), and the amount 
reserved for State administration exceeds $250,000. The State determines 
the amount of funds to be reserved for each program under title II, 
parts A, B, and C of the Act as follows:
    (a) First, the State subtracts $1,581,000 from the $20,000,000 total 
basic programs award ($20,000,000 -$1,581,000 = $18,419,000).
    (b) Second, the State determines the amount that would have been 
reserved for each of the programs under parts A, B, and C of title II of 
the Act in the absence of a shortfall in the set-aside amount for the 
Program for Single Parents, Displaced Homemakers, and Single Pregnant 
Women, as follows:

5.0% x$20,000,000 =             $1,000,000  for administration.
3.5% x$20,000,000 =                700,000  for Sex Equity Programs.
8.5% x$20,000,000 =              1,700,000  for State Programs and State
                                             Leadership Activities.
1.0% x$20,000,000 =                200,000  for Programs for Criminal
                                             Offenders.
75.0% x$20,000,000 =            15,000,000  for part C of title II.
                              -------------
                                18,600,000
 

    (c) Third, the State converts each of these amounts into a 
percentage by dividing each amount by the sum of the amounts the 
programs would have earned in the absence of a shortfall ($18,600,000) 
and multiplies the remaining basic programs award ($18,419,000) by these 
percentages to determine the amount to reserve for each program under 
parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act, as follows:

($1,000,000/$18,600,000)          $990,269  for administration.
 x$18,419,000 =
($700,000/$18,600,000)             693,188  for Sex Equity Programs.
 x$18,419,000 =
($1,700,000/$18,600,000)         1,683,457  for State Programs and State
 x$18,419,000 =                              Leadership Activities.
($200,000/$18,600,000)             198,054  for Programs for Criminal
 x$18,419,000 =                              Offenders.

 x$18,419,000 =
                              -------------
                                18,419,000
 

    This example assumes that amounts reserved for the Sex Equity 
Program and Programs for Criminal Offenders meet the ``hold-harmless'' 
requirement of section 102(c) (1) and (2) of the Act.
    Example 3: A State's one percent reserved from its FY 1992 grant for 
Programs for Criminal Offenders is $200,000 and the amount reserved for 
that program under section 202(6) of the CDPVEA plus other amounts 
obligated for projects, services, and activities for criminal offenders 
in correctional institutions from its FY 1991 grant from the FY 1990 
appropriations totals $250,000. Therefore, the amount of FY 1992 funds 
reserved for that program is $50,000 less than the amount reserved and 
obligated for that program in FY 1991. The State received a basic 
programs award of $20,000,000 in FY 1992. The other programs under title 
II, part B meet the ``hold-harmless'' requirement of Sec. 403.180(a)(1) 
and the amount reserved for State administration exceeds $250,000. The 
State determines the amount of funds to be reserved for each program 
under title II, parts A, B, and C of the Act as follows:
    (a) First, the State subtracts $250,000 from the $20,000,000 total 
basic programs award ($20,000,000 -$250,000 = $19,750,000).
    (b) Second, the State determines the amount that would have been 
reserved for each of the programs under parts A, B, and C of title II of 
the Act in the absence of a shortfall in the set-aside amount for the 
Programs for Criminal Offenders, as follows:

5.0% x20,000,000 =              $1,000,000  for administration.
3.5% x20,000,000 =                 700,000  for Sex Equity Programs.
7.0% x20,000,000 =               1,400,000  for Programs for Single
                                             Parents, Displaced
                                             Homemakers, and Single
                                             Pregnant Women.
8.5% x20,000,000 =               1,700,000  for State Programs and State
                                             Leadership Activities.
75.0% x20,000,000 =             15,000,000  for part C of title II.

                                19,800,000
 

    (c) Third, the State converts each of these amounts into a 
percentage by dividing each amount by the sum of the amounts the 
programs would have earned in the absence of a shortfall ($19,800,000) 
and multiplies the remaining basic programs award ($19,750,000) by these 
percentages to determine the amount to reserve for each program under 
parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act, as follows:

    This example assumes that amounts reserved for the Sex Equity 
Program and for the Program for Single Parents, Displaced Homemakers, 
and Single Pregnant Women meet the ``hold-harmless'' requirement of 
sections 102(c) (1) and (2) of the Act.

    (d) The procedure for meeting the ratable reduction provision in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section is as follows:
    (1) If a State's basic programs award under title II of the Act for 
FY 1992 or in future years is less than that State's basic grant amount 
in FY 1991, a State shall determine the percentage that the basic 
programs award is of the FY 1991 basic programs award.
    (2) The State shall multiply the amounts reserved in FY 1991 for 
each of the three programs covered by the ``hold-harmless'' provisions 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by this percentage.
    (3) The State shall compare the amounts that would be reserved for 
these programs in FY 1992 to determine if these amounts are less than 
the ratably reduced hold-harmless amounts, and if so, shall proceed with 
the calculation required by paragraph (c) of this section except using 
the ratably reduced ``hold-harmless'' amounts.

Sec. 403.181  What are the cost-sharing requirements applicable to the basic programs?

    (a) A State shall match, from non-Federal sources and on a dollar-
for-dollar basis, the funds reserved for administration of the State 
plan under Sec. 403.180(b)(4).
    (b) The matching requirement under paragraph (a) of this section may 
be applied overall, rather than line-by-line, to State administrative 
expenditures.
    (c) A State shall provide from non-Federal sources for State 
administration under the Act an amount that is not less than the amount 
provided by the State from non-Federal sources for State administrative 
costs for the preceding fiscal or program year.

    Example for paragraph (b): From the five percent reserved for the 
administration of the State plan, a State must reserve $60,000 to carry 
out the provisions in Sec. 403.13. The $60,000 must be matched, but the 
matching funds need not be used for the activities described in 
Sec. 403.13.

<R05>
Sec. 403.182  What is the maintenance of fiscal effort requirement?

    The Secretary may not make a payment under the Act to a State for 
any fiscal year unless the Secretary determines that the fiscal effort 
per student, or the aggregate expenditures of that State, from State 
sources, for vocational education for the fiscal year (or program year) 
preceding the fiscal year (or program year) for which the determination 
is made, at least equaled its effort or expenditures for vocational 
education for the second preceding fiscal year (or program year).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 2463(a))


<R05>
Sec. 403.183  Under what circumstances may the Secretary waive the maintenance of effort requirement?

    (a) The Secretary may waive the maintenance of effort requirement in 
Sec. 403.182 for a State for one year only if--
    (1) The Secretary determines that a waiver would be equitable due to 
exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the State's 
ability to maintain fiscal effort; and
    (2) The State has decreased its expenditures for vocational 
education from non-Federal sources by no more than five percent.
    (b) For purposes of this section, ``exceptional or uncontrollable 
circumstances'' include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) A natural disaster.
    (2) An unforeseen and precipitous decline in financial resources.

    (c) The Secretary does not consider tax initiatives or referenda to 
be exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 403.184  How does a State request a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement?

    A State seeking a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement in 
Sec. 403.182 shall--
    (a) Submit to the Secretary a request for a waiver; and
    (b) Include in the request--
    (1) The reason for the request;
    (2) Information that demonstrates that a waiver is justified; and
    (3) Any additional information the Secretary may require.

<R05>
Sec. 403.185  How does the Secretary compute maintenance of effort in the event of a waiver?

    If a State has been granted a waiver of the maintenance of effort 
requirement that allows it to receive a grant for a fiscal year, the 
Secretary determines whether the State has met that requirement for the 
grant to be awarded for the year after the year of the waiver by 
comparing the amount spent for vocational education from non-Federal 
sources in the first preceding fiscal year (or program year) with the 
amount spent in the third preceding fiscal year (or program year).

    Example: Because exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances 
prevented a State from maintaining its level of fiscal effort in a 
program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989) at the level of its 
fiscal effort in program year 1988 (July 1, 1987-June 30, 1988), the 
Secretary granted the State a waiver of the maintenance of effort 
requirement that permits the State to receive its fiscal year 1990 grant 
(a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1990 from funds 
appropriated in the fiscal year 1990 appropriation). To be eligible to 
receive its fiscal year 1991 grant (the grant to be awarded for the year 
after the year of the waiver), the State's expenditures from the first 
preceding program year (July 1, 1989-June 30, 1990) must equal or exceed 
its expenditures from the third preceding program year (July 1, 1987 to 
June 30, 1988).

State may use only an amount of funds from its allotment for the State 
Assistance for Vocational Education Support Programs by Community-Based 
Organizations that is necessary and reasonable for the proper and 
efficient State administration of that program.
    (3) In addition to the funds reserved under Sec. 403.180(b)(4), a 
State may use the amounts reserved for the Consumer and Homemaking 
Education Program, the Comprehensive Career Guidance and Counseling 
Program, and the Business-Labor-Education Partnership for Training 
Program under Secs. 403.151(c), 403.161(c), and 403.173(b),

Appendix A to Part 403--Examples for 34 CFR 403.111(a) and 403.111(c)(3)

    Illustration of providing full participation under 34 CFR 
403.111(a). An educationally disadvantaged student is enrolled in a 
course that is part of a vocational education program and is having 
trouble understanding a math concept (e.g., negative numbers) necessary 
to succeed in the course. To ensure the student's full participation in 
the course, a local educational agency may use funds awarded under 
Sec. 403.112 as needed to provide tutoring in negative numbers to enable 
the student to understand the concept well enough to complete the 
vocational education course.
    Illustrations of providing equitable participation under 34 CFR 
403.111(c)(3). Example 1: An area vocational education school conducts 
an informal meeting to provide the information required in 
Sec. 403.193(a) regarding the area vocational education school's 
vocational education programs, to parents of students who are members of 
special populations in a local educational agency whose allocation was 
distributed to the area vocational education school under Sec. 403.113. 
The area vocational education school conducts the meeting at a time and 
in a location convenient for these parents and students. At the meeting, 
the area vocational education school provides a staff person to assist 
students or their parents to complete any forms necessary to enroll in 
the area vocational education school's vocational education program.
    Example 2: A hearing-impaired student in a local educational agency 
could participate in the vocational education program only if an 
interpreter is provided for that student. The local educational agency 
cannot refuse to admit the student because of the need for an 
interpreter.

   Appendix B to Part 403--Examples for 34 CFR 403.194--Comparability 
                              Requirements

    Methods by which a local educational agency can demonstrate its 
compliance with the comparability requirements in 34 CFR 403.194(a) 
include the following:
    Example 1: The local educational agency files with the State board a 
written assurance that it has established and implemented--
    (a) A district-wide salary schedule;
    (b) A policy to ensure equivalence among secondary schools or sites 
in teachers, administrators, and auxiliary personnel; and
    (c) A policy to ensure equivalency among secondary schools or sites 
in the provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies.
    Example 2: The local educational agency establishes and implements 
other procedures for ensuring comparability, such as the following:
    (a) Comparing the average number of students per instructional staff 
in each secondary school or site served with Federal funds awarded under 
the State plan with the average number of students per instructional 
staff in secondary schools or sites not served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan. A served school is considered comparable 
if its average does not exceed 110 percent of the average of schools or 
sites in the local educational agency not served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan; or
    (b) Comparing the average instructional staff salary expenditures 
per student in each secondary school or site served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan with the average instructional staff salary 
expenditure per student in schools or sites in the local educational 
agency not served with Federal funds awarded under the State plan. A 
served school is considered comparable if its average is at least 90 
percent of the average of schools or sites not served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan.

           Subpart E--What Conditions Must be Met by a State?


<R05>
Sec. 461.40  What are the State and local administrative costs requirements?

    (a)(1) Beginning with the fiscal year 1991 grant (a grant that is 
awarded on or after July 1, 1991 from funds appropriated in the fiscal 
year 1991 appropriation), an SEA may use no more than 5 percent of its 
grant or $50,000--

[[Page 133]]

whichever is greater--for necessary and reasonable State administrative 
costs.
    (2) For grants awarded from funds appropriated for fiscal years 
prior to fiscal year 1991 (grants awarded before July 1, 1991), an SEA 
may determine what percent of its grant is necessary and reasonable for 
State administrative costs.
    (b)(1) At least 95 percent of an eligible recipient's award from the 
SEA must be expended for adult education instructional activities.
    (2) The remainder may be used for local administrative costs--
noninstructional expenses, including planning, administration, 
evaluation, personnel development, and coordination--that are necessary 
and reasonable.
    (3) If the administrative cost limits under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section are insufficient for adequate planning, administration, 
evaluation, personnel development, and coordination of programs 
supported under the Act, the SEA shall negotiate with local grant 
recipients in order to determine an adequate level of funds to be used 
for noninstructional purposes.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1203b and 1205(c))


<R05>
Sec. 461.41  What are the cost-sharing requirements?

    (a) The Federal share of expenditures made under a State plan for 
any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico may not exceed--
    (1) 90 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal 
year 1988 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1988 from 
funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1988 appropriation);
    (2) 90 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal 
year 1989 (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1989 from funds 
appropriated in the fiscal year 1989 appropriation);
    (3) 85 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal 
year 1990 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1990 from 
funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1990 appropriation);
    (4) 80 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal 
year 1991 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1991 from 
funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1991 appropriation); and
    (5) 75 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal 
year 1992 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1992 from 
funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1992 appropriation) and from each 
grant thereafter.
    (b) The Federal share for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Virgin Islands is 100 percent.
    (c) The Secretary determines the non-Federal share of expenditures 
under the State plan by considering--
    (1) Expenditures from State, local, and other non-Federal sources 
for programs, services, and activities of adult education, as defined in 
the Act, made by public or private entities that receive from the State 
Federal funds made available under the Act or State funds for adult 
education; and
    (2) Expenditures made directly by the State for programs, services, 
and activities of adult education as defined in the Act.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1209(a); 48 U.S.C. 1681)


<R05>
Sec. 461.42  What is the maintenance of effort requirement?

    (a) Basic standard. (1)(i) Except as provided in Sec. 461.43, a 
State is eligible for a grant from appropriations for any fiscal year 
only if the Secretary determines that the State has expended for adult 
education from non-Federal sources during the second preceding fiscal 
year (or program year) an amount not less than the amount expended 
during the third preceding fiscal year (or program year).
    (ii) The Secretary determines maintenance of effort on a per student 
expenditure basis or on a total expenditure basis.
    (2) For purposes of determining maintenance of effort, the ``second 
preceding fiscal year (or program year)'' is the fiscal year (or program 
year) two years prior to the year of the grant for which the Secretary 
is determining the State's eligibility. The ``third preceding fiscal 
year (or program year)'' is the fiscal year (or program year) three 
years prior to the year of the grant for

[[Page 134]]

which the Secretary is determining the State's eligibility.
    Example: Computation based on fiscal year. If a State chooses to use 
the fiscal year as the basis for its maintenance of effort computations, 
the Secretary determines whether a State is eligible for the fiscal year 
1992 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1992 from funds 
appropriated in the fiscal year 1992 appropriation) by comparing 
expenditures from the second preceding fiscal year--fiscal year 1990 
(October 1, 1989-September 30, 1990)--with expenditures from the third 
preceding fiscal year--fiscal year 1989 (October 1, 1988-September 30, 
1989). If there has been no decrease in expenditures from fiscal year 
1989 to fiscal year 1990, the State has maintained effort and is 
eligible for its fiscal year 1992 grant.
    Computation based on program year. If a State chooses to use a 
program year running from July 1 to June 30 as the basis for its 
maintenance of effort computation, the Secretary determines whether a 
State is eligible for funds for the fiscal year 1992 grant by comparing 
expenditures from the second preceding program year--program year 1990 
(July 1, 1989-June 30, 1990)--with expenditures from the third preceding 
program year--program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989). If there 
has been no decrease in expenditures from program year 1989 to program 
year 1990, the State has maintained effort and is eligible for its 
fiscal year 1992 grant.
    (b) Expenditures to be considered. In determining a State's 
compliance with the maintenance of effort requirement, the Secretary 
considers the expenditures described in Sec. 461.41(c).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1209(b))


<R05>
Sec. 461.43  Under what circumstances may the Secretary waive the maintenance of effort requirement?

    (a) The Secretary may waive, for one year only, the maintenance of 
effort requirement in Sec. 461.42 if the Secretary determines that a 
waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable 
circumstances. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (1) A natural disaster.
    (2) An unforeseen and precipitous decline in financial resources.
    (b) The Secretary does not consider a tax initiative or referendum 
to be an exceptional or uncontrollable circumstance.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1209(b)(2))


<R05>
Sec. 461.44  How does a State request a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement?

    An SEA seeking a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement in 
Sec. 461.42 shall--
    (a) Submit to the Secretary a request for a waiver; and
    (b) Include in the request--
    (1) The reason for the request; and
    (2) Any additional information the Secretary may require.

1830-0501)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1209(b)(2))


<R05>
Sec. 461.45  How does the Secretary compute maintenance of effort in the event of a waiver?

    If a State has been granted a waiver of the maintenance of effort 
requirement that allows it to receive a grant from appropriations for a 
fiscal year, the Secretary determines whether the State has meet that 
requirement for the grant to be awarded for the year after the year of 
the waiver by comparing the amount spent for adult education from non-
Federal sources in the second preceding fiscal year (or program year) 
with the amount spent in the fourth preceding fiscal year (or program 
year.)

    Example: Because exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances 
prevented a State from maintaining effort in fiscal year 1990 (October 
1, 1989-September 30, 1990) or in program year 1990 (July 1, 1989-June 
30, 1990) at the level of fiscal year 1989 (October 1, 1988-September 
30, 1989) or program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989), 
respectively, the Secretary grants the State a waiver of the maintenance 
of effort requirement that permits the State to receive its fiscal year 
1992 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1992 from funds 
appropriated in the fiscal year 1992 appropriation). In order to 
determine whether a State has met the maintenance of effort requirement 
and therefore is eligible to receive its fiscal year 1993 grant (the 
grant to be awarded for the year after the year of the waiver), the 
Secretary compares the State's expenditures from the second preceding 
fiscal year (or program year--fiscal year 1991 (October 1, 1990-
September 30, 1991) or program year 1991 (July 1, 1990-June 30, 1991)--
with expenditures from the fourth preceding fiscal year--fiscal year 
1989 (October 1, 1988-September 30, 1989) or program year 1989 (July 1, 
1988-June 30, 1989). If

[[Page 135]]

the expenditures from fiscal year (or program year) 1991 are not less 
than the expenditures from fiscal year (or program year) 1989, the State 
has maintained effort and is eligible for its fiscal year 1993 grant.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1209(b)(2))


<R05>
Sec. 461.46  What requirements for program reviews and evaluations must be met by a State?

    (a) An SEA shall provide for program reviews and evaluations of all 
State-administered adult education programs, services, and activities it 
assists under the Act. The SEA shall use its program reviews and 
evaluations to assist LEAs and other recipients of funds in planning and 
operating the best possible programs of adult education and to improve 
the State's programs of adult education.
    (b) In reviewing programs, an SEA shall, during the four-year period 
of the State plan, gather and analyze data--including standardized test 
data--on the effectiveness of State-administered adult education 
programs, services, and activities to determine the extent to which--
    (1) The State's adult education programs are achieving the goals in 
the State plan, including the goal of serving educationally 
disadvantaged adults; and
    (2) Grant recipients have improved their capacity to achieve the 
purposes of the Act.
    (c)(1) An SEA shall, each year during the four-year period of the 
State plan, evaluate in qualitative and quantitative terms the 
effectiveness of programs, services, and activities conducted by at 
least 20 percent of the local recipients of funds so that at the end of 
that period 80 percent of all local recipients have been evaluated once.
    (2) An evaluation must consider the following factors:
    (i) Projected goals of the recipient as described in its application 
pursuant to section 322(a)(4) of the Act and Sec. 461.31(c)(4).
    (ii) Planning and content of the programs, services, and activities.
    (iii) Curriculum, instructional materials, and equipment.

    (ii) The information required under Sec. 461.10(b)(10).
    (iii) A report on the SEA's activities under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (iv) A report on the SEA's activities under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (2) The reports described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section must include--
    (i) The results of any program reviews and evaluations performed 
during the program year, and a description of how the SEA used the 
program reviews and evaluation process to make necessary changes to 
improve programs; and
    (ii) The comments and recommendations of the State advisory council, 
if a council has been established under Sec. 461.50.

Sec. 600.1  Scope.

    This part establishes the rules and procedures that the Secretary

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1088, 1094, 1099b, 1099c, and 1141)


<R05>
Sec. 600.2  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to terms used in this part:
    Accredited: The status of public recognition that a nationally 
recognized accrediting agency grants to an institution or educational 
program that meets the agency's established requirements.
    Award year: The period of time from July 1 of one year through June 
30 of the following year.
    Branch Campus: A location of an institution that is geographically 
apart and independent of the main campus of the institution. The 
Secretary considers a location of an institution to be independent of 
the main campus if the location--
    (1) Is permanent in nature;
    (2) Offers courses in educational programs leading to a degree, 
certificate, or other recognized educational credential;
    (3) Has its own faculty and administrative or supervisory 
organization; and
    (4) Has its own budgetary and hiring authority.
    Clock hour: A period of time consisting of--

[[Page 176]]

    (1) A 50- to 60-minute class, lecture, or recitation in a 60-minute 
period;
    (2) A 50- to 60-minute faculty-supervised laboratory, shop training, 
or internship in a 60-minute period; or
    (3) Sixty minutes of preparation in a correspondence course.
    Correspondence course: (1) A ``home study'' course provided by an 
institution under which the institution provides instructional 
materials, including examinations on the materials, to students who are 
not physically attending classes at the institution. When students 
complete a portion of the instructional materials, the students take the 
examinations that relate to that portion of the materials, and return 
the examinations to the institution for grading.
    (2) A home study course that provides instruction in whole or in 
part through the use of video cassettes or video discs in an award year 
is a correspondence course unless the institution also delivers the 
instruction on the cassette or disc to students physically attending 
classes at the institution during the same award year.
    (3) A course at an institution that may otherwise satisfy the 
definition of a ``telecommunications course'' is a correspondence course 
if the sum of telecommunications and other correspondence courses 
offered by that institution equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total 
courses offered at that institution.
    (4) If a course is part correspondence and part residential 
training, the Secretary considers the course to be a correspondence 
course.
    Educational program: A legally authorized postsecondary program of 
organized instruction or study that leads to an academic, professional, 
or vocational degree, or certificate, or other recognized educational 
credential. However, the Secretary does not consider that an institution 
provides an educational program if the institution does not provide 
instruction itself (including a course of independent study), but merely 
gives credit for one or more of the following: instruction provided by 
other institutions or schools; examinations provided by agencies or 
organizations; or other accomplishments such as ``life experience.''
    Eligible institution: An institution that--
    (1) Qualifies as--
    (i) An institution of higher education, as defined in Sec. 600.4;
    (ii) A proprietary institution of higher education, as defined in 
Sec. 600.5; or
    (iii) A postsecondary vocational institution, as defined in 
Sec. 600.6; and
    (2) Meets all the other applicable provisions of this part.
    Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Programs: The loan programs 
(formerly called the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs) authorized 
by title IV-B of the HEA, including the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal 
PLUS, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (Federal SLS), and Federal 
Consolidation Loan programs, in which lenders use their own funds to 
make loans to enable students or their parents to pay the costs of the 
students' attendance at eligible institutions. The Federal Stafford 
Loan, Federal PLUS, Federal SLS, and Federal Consolidation Loan programs 
are defined in 34 CFR part 668.
    Incarcerated student: A student who is serving a criminal sentence 
in a Federal, State, or local penitentiary, prison, jail, reformatory, 
work farm, or other similar correctional institution. A student is not 
considered incarcerated if that student is in a half-way house or home 
detention or is sentenced to serve only weekends.
    Legally authorized: The legal status granted to an institution 
through a charter, license, or other written document issued by the 
appropriate agency or official of the State in which the institution is 
physically located.
    Nationally recognized accrediting agency: An agency or association 
that the Secretary recognizes as a reliable authority to determine the 
quality of education or training offered by an institution or a program 
offered by an institution. The Secretary recognizes these agencies and 
associations under the provisions of 34 CFR part 602 and publishes a 
list of the recognized agencies in the Federal Register.
    Nonprofit institution: An institution that--
    (1) Is owned and operated by one or more nonprofit corporations or 
associations, no part of the net earnings of

[[Page 177]]

which benefits any private shareholder or individual;
    (2) Is legally authorized to operate as a nonprofit organization by 
each State in which it is physically located; and
    (3) Is determined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be an 
organization to which contributions are tax-deductible in accordance

501(c)(3)).
    One-academic-year training program: An educational program that is 
at least one academic year as defined under 34 CFR 668.2.
    Preaccredited: A status that a nationally recognized accrediting 
agency, recognized by the Secretary to grant that status, has accorded 
an unaccredited public or private nonprofit institution that is 
progressing toward accreditation within a reasonable period of time.
    Recognized equivalent of a high school diploma: The following are 
the equivalent of a high school diploma--
    (1) A General Education Development Certificate (GED);
    (2) A State certificate received by a student after the student has 
passed a State-authorized examination that the State recognizes as the

section.
    (b)(1) The Secretary considers an institution to have been in 
existence for two years only if--
    (i) The institution has been legally authorized to provide, and has 
provided, a continuous educational program to prepare students for 
gainful employment in a recognized occupation during the 24 months 
preceding the date of its eligibility application; and
    (ii) The educational program that the institution provides on the 
date of its eligibility application is substantially the same in length 
and subject matter as the program that the institution provided during 
the 24 months preceding the date of its eligibility application.
    (2)(i) The Secretary considers an institution to have provided a 
continuous educational program during the 24 months preceding the date 
of its eligibility application even if the institution did not provide 
that program during normal vacation periods, or periods

when the institution temporarily closed due to a natural disaster that 
directly affected the institution or the institution's students.
    (ii) The Secretary considers an institution to have satisfied the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section if the institution 
substantially changed the subject matter of the educational program it 
provided during that 24-month period because of new technology or the 
requirements of other Federal agencies.
    (3) In determining whether an applicant institution satisfies the 
requirement contained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary--
    (i) Counts any period during which the applicant institution has 
been certified as a branch campus; and
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, does 
not count any period during which the applicant institution was a part 
of another eligible proprietary institution of higher education, 
postsecondary vocational institution, or vocational school.
    (c) An institution is physically located in a State if it has a 
campus or other instructional site in that State.
    (d)(1) An institution satisfies the requirement contained in 
paragraph (a)(8) of this section by examining its revenues under the 
following formula for its latest complete fiscal year:

Title IV, HEA program funds the institution used to satisfy its 
    students' tuition, fees, and other institutional charges to students
The sum of revenues including title IV, HEA program funds generated by 
    the institution from: tuition, fees, and other institutional charges 
    for students enrolled in eligible programs as defined in 34 CFR 
    668.8; and activities conducted by the institution, to the extent 
    not included in tuition, fees, and other institutional charges, that 
    are necessary for the education or training of its students who are 
    enrolled in those eligible programs.

    (2) An institution must use the cash basis of accounting when 
calculating the amount of title IV, HEA program funds in the numerator 
and the total amount of revenue generated by the institution in the 
denominator of the fraction contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Under the cash basis of accounting--
    (i) In calculating the amount of revenue generated by the 
institution from institutional loans, the institution must include only 
the amount of loan repayments received by the institution during the 
fiscal year; and
    (ii) In calculating the amount of revenue generated by the 
institution from institutional scholarships, the institution must 
include only the amount of funds it disbursed during the fiscal year 
from an established restricted account and only to the extent that the 
funds in that account represent designated funds from an outside source 
or income earned on those funds.
    (e) With regard to the formula contained in paragraph(d)(1) of this 
section--
    (1) The institution may not include as title IV, HEA program funds 
in the numerator nor as revenue generated by the institution in the 
denominator--
    (i) The amount of funds it received under the Federal Work-Study 
(FWS) Program, unless the institution used those funds to pay a 
student's institutional charges in which case the FWS program funds used 
to pay those charges would be included in the numerator and denominator.
    (ii) The amount of funds it received under the Leveraging 
Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) Program. (The LEAP Program was 
formerly called the State Student Incentive Grant or SSIG Program.);
    (iii) The amount of institutional funds it used to match title IV, 
HEA program funds;
    (iv) The amount of title IV, HEA program funds that must be refunded 
or returned under Sec. 668.22; or
    (v) The amount charged for books, supplies, and equipment unless the 
institution includes that amount as tuition, fees, or other 
institutional charges.
    (2) In determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds 
received by the institution under the cash basis of accounting, except 
as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the institution must 
presume that any title IV, HEA program funds disbursed or delivered to 
or on behalf of a student

[[Page 180]]

will be used to pay the student's tuition, fees, or other institutional 
charges, regardless of whether the institution credits those funds to 
the student's account or pays those funds directly to the student, and 
therefore must include those funds in the numerator and denominator.
    (3) In paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the institution may not 
presume that title IV, HEA program funds were used to pay tuition, fees, 
and other institutional charges to the extent that those charges were 
satisfied by--
    (i) Grant funds provided by non-Federal public agencies, or private 
sources independent of the institution;
    (ii) Funds provided under a contractual arrangement described in 
Sec. 600.7(d), or
    (iii) Funds provided by State prepaid tuition plans.

activities that--
    (i) Are conducted on campus or at a facility under the control of 
the institution;
    (ii) Are performed under the supervision of a member of the 
institution's faculty; and
    (iii) Are required to be performed by all students in a specific 
educational program at the institution.
    (f) An institution must notify the Secretary within 90 days 
following the end of the fiscal year used in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section if it fails to satisfy the requirement contained in paragraph 
(a)(8) of this section.
    (g) If an institution loses its eligibility because it failed to 
satisfy the requirement contained in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, 
to regain its eligibility it must demonstrate compliance with all 
eligibility requirements for at least the fiscal year following the 
fiscal year used in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (h) The Secretary does not recognize the accreditation of an 
institution unless the institution agrees to submit any dispute 
involving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation 
to initial arbitration before initiating any other legal action.

institution temporarily closed due to a natural disaster that affected 
the institution or the institution's students.
    (ii) The Secretary considers an institution to have satisfied the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section if the institution

Sec. 600.7  Conditions of institutional ineligibility.

    (a) General rule. For purposes of title IV of the HEA, an 
educational institution that otherwise satisfies the requirements 
contained in Secs. 600.4, 600.5, or 600.6 nevertheless does not qualify 
as an eligible institution under this part if--
    (1) For its latest complete award year--
    (i) More than 50 percent of the institution's courses were 
correspondence courses as calculated under paragraph (b) of this 
section;
    (ii) Fifty percent or more of the institution's regular enrolled 
students were enrolled in correspondence courses;
    (iii) More than twenty-five percent of the institution's regular 
enrolled students were incarcerated;
    (iv) More than fifty percent of its regular enrolled students had 
neither a high school diploma nor the recognized equivalent of a high 
school diploma, and the institution does not provide a four-year or two-
year educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree or an 
associate degree, respectively;
    (2) The institution, or an affiliate of the institution that has the 
power, by contract or ownership interest, to direct or cause the 
direction of the management of policies of the institution--
    (A) Files for relief in bankruptcy, or
    (B) Has entered against it an order for relief in bankruptcy; or
    (3) The institution, its owner, or its chief executive officer--
    (i) Has pled guilty to, has pled nolo contendere to, or is found 
guilty of, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of 
title IV, HEA program funds; or
    (ii) Has been judicially determined to have committed fraud 
involving title IV, HEA program funds.
    (b) Special provisions regarding correspondence courses and 
students--(1) Treatment of telecommunications courses. For purposes of 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, the Secretary

[[Page 182]]

considers a telecommunications course to be a correspondence course if 
the sum of telecommunications courses and other correspondence courses 
the institution provided during that award year equaled or exceeded 50 
percent of the total number of courses it provided during that year.
    (2) Calculating the number of courses. For purposes of paragraphs 
(a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section--
    (i) A correspondence course may be a complete educational program 
offered by correspondence, or one course provided by correspondence in 
an on-campus (residential) educational program;
    (ii) A course must be considered as being offered once during an 
award year regardless of the number of times it is offered during that 
year; and
    (iii) A course that is offered both on campus and by correspondence 
must be considered two courses for the purpose of determining the total 
number of courses the institution provided during an award year.
    (3) Exceptions. (i) The provisions contained in paragraphs (a)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to an institution that 
qualifies as a ``technical institute or vocational school used 
exclusively or principally for the provision of vocational education to 
individuals who have completed or left high school and who are available 
for study in preparation for entering the labor market'' under section 
521(4)(C) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology 
Education Act.
    (ii) The Secretary waives the limitation contained in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section for an institution that offers a 2-year 
associate-degree or a 4-year bachelor's-degree program if the students 
enrolled in the institution's correspondence courses receive no more 
than 5 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by students 
at that institution.
    (c) Special provisions regarding incarcerated students--(1) 
Exception. The Secretary may waive the prohibition contained in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, upon the application of an 
institution, if the institution is a nonprofit institution that provides 
four-year or two-year educational programs for which it awards a 
bachelor's degree, an associate degree, or a postsecondary diploma.
    (2) Waiver for entire institution. If the nonprofit institution that 
applies for a waiver consists solely of four-year or two-year 
educational programs for which it awards a bachelor's degree, an 
associate degree, or a postsecondary diploma, the Secretary waives the 
prohibition contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section for the 
entire institution.
    (3) Other waivers. If the nonprofit institution that applies for a 
waiver does not consist solely of four-year or two-year educational 
programs for which it awards a bachelor's degree, an associate degree, 
or a postsecondary diploma, the Secretary waives the prohibition 
contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section--
    (i) For the four-year and two-year programs for which it awards a 
bachelor's degree, an associate degree or a postsecondary diploma; and
    (ii) For the other programs the institution provides, if the 
incarcerated regular students enrolled in those other programs have a 
completion rate of 50 percent or greater.
    (d) Special provision for a nonprofit institution if more than 50 
percent of its enrollment consists of students who do not have a high 
school diploma or its equivalent. (1) Subject to the provisions 
contained in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the Secretary 
waives the limitation contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section 
for a nonprofit institution if that institution demonstrates to the 
Secretary's satisfaction that it exceeds that limitation because it 
serves, through contracts with Federal, State, or local government 
agencies, significant numbers of students who do not have a high school 
diploma or its recognized equivalent.
    (2) Number of critical students. The Secretary grants a waiver under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section only if no more than 40 percent of the 
institution's enrollment of regular students consists of students who--
    (i) Do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent; and

of this section.

[[Page 183]]

purposes of granting a waiver under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
the contracts referred to must be with Federal, State, or local 
government agencies for the purpose of providing job training to low-
income individuals who are in need of that training. An example of such 
a contract is a job training contract under the Job Training Partnership 
Act (JPTA).
    (e) Special provisions. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)of this 
section, when counting regular students, the institution shall--
    (i) Count each regular student without regard to the full-time or 
part-time nature of the student's attendance (i.e., ``head count'' 
rather than ``full-time equivalent'');
    (ii) Count a regular student once regardless of the number of times 
the student enrolls during an award year; and
    (iii) Determine the number of regular students who enrolled in the 
institution during the relevant award year by--
    (A) Calculating the number of regular students who enrolled during 
that award year; and
    (B) Excluding from the number of students in paragraph 
(e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the number of regular students who 
enrolled but subsequently withdrew or were expelled from the institution 
and were entitled to receive a 100 percent refund of their tuition and 
fees less any administrative fee that the institution is permitted to 
keep under its fair and equitable refund policy.
    (2) For the purpose of calculating a completion rate under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section, the institution shall--
    (i) Determine the number of regular incarcerated students who 
enrolled in the other programs during the last completed award year;
    (ii) Exclude from the number of regular incarcerated students 
determined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the number of those 
students who enrolled but subsequently withdrew or were expelled from 
the institution and were entitled to receive a 100 percent refund of 
their tuition and fees, less any administrative fee the institution is 
permitted to keep under the institution's fair and equitable refund 
policy;
    (iii) Exclude from the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of 
this section, the number of those regular incarcerated students who 
remained enrolled in the programs at the end of the applicable award 
year;
    (iv) From the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this 
section, determine the number of regular incarcerated students who 
received a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational 
credential awarded for successfully completing the program during the 
applicable award year; and
    (v) Divide the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this 
section by the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section 
and multiply by 100.
    (f)(1) If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under this 
section, the waiver extends indefinitely provided that the institution 
satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year.
    (2) If an institution fails to satisfy the waiver requirements for 
an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that 
award year.
    (g)(1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any 
applicable waiver or exception under this section, the institution shall 
substantiate the required calculations by having the certified public 
accountant who prepares its audited financial statement under 34 CFR 
668.15 or its title IV, HEA program compliance audit under 34 CFR 668.23 
report on the accuracy of those determinations.
    (2) The certified public accountant's report must be based on 
performing an ``attestation engagement'' in accordance with the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA's) Statement on 
Standards for Attestation Engagements. The certified public accountant 
shall include that attestation report with or as part of the audit 
report referenced in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (3) The certified public accountant's attestation report must 
indicate whether the institution's determinations regarding paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section and any relevant waiver or exception under 
paragraphs (b), (c), and

[[Page 184]]

(d) of this section are accurate; i.e., fairly presented in all material 
respects.
    (h) Notice to the Secretary. An institution shall notify the 
Secretary--
    (1) By July 31 following the end of an award year if it falls within 
one of the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a)(1)of this section, or 
fails to continue to satisfy a waiver or exception granted under this 
section; or
    (2) Within 10 days if it falls within one of the prohibitions 
contained in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
    (i) Regaining eligibility. (1) If an institution loses its 
eligibility because of one of the prohibitions contained in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, to regain its eligibility, it must demonstrate--
    (i) Compliance with all eligibility requirements;
    (ii) That it did not fall within any of the prohibitions contained 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for at least one award year; and
    (iii) That it changed its administrative policies and practices to 
ensure that it will not fall within any of the prohibitions contained in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (2) If an institution loses its eligibility because of one of the 
prohibitions contained in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, 
this loss is permanent. The institution's eligibility cannot be

<R05>
Sec. 600.10  Date, extent, duration, and consequence of eligibility.

    (a) Date of eligibility. (1) If the Secretary determines that an 
applicant institution satisfies all the statutory and regulatory 
eligibility requirements, the Secretary considers the institution to be 
an eligible institution as of the date--
    (i) The Secretary signs the institution's program participation 
agreement described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, for purposes of 
participating in any title IV, HEA program; and
    (ii) The Secretary receives all the information necessary to make 
that determination for purposes other than participating in any title 
IV, HEA program.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Extent of eligibility. (1) If the Secretary determines that the 
entire applicant institution, including all its locations and all its 
educational programs, satisfies the applicable requirements of this 
part, the Secretary extends eligibility to all educational programs and 
locations identified on the institution's application for eligibility.
    (2) If the Secretary determines that only certain educational 
programs or certain locations of an applicant institution satisfy the 
applicable requirements of this part, the Secretary extends eligibility 
only to those educational programs and locations that meet those 
requirements and identifies the eligible educational programs and 
locations in the eligibility notice sent to the institution under 
Sec. 600.21.
    (3) Eligibility does not extend to any location that an institution 
establishes after it receives its eligibility designation if the 
institution provides at least 50 percent of an educational program at 
that location, unless--
    (i) The Secretary approves that location under Sec. 600.20(e)(4); or
    (ii) The location is licensed and accredited, the institution does 
not have to apply to the Secretary for approval of that location under 
Sec. 600.20(c), and the institution has reported to the Secretary that 
location under Sec. 600.21.
    (c) Subsequent additions of educational programs. (1) Except as 
provided in

[[Page 185]]

paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if an eligible institution adds an 
educational program after it has been designated as an eligible 
institution by the Secretary, the institution must apply to the 
Secretary to have that additional program designated as an eligible 
program of that institution.
    (2) An eligible institution that adds an educational program after 
it has been designated as an eligible institution by the Secretary does 
not have to apply to the Secretary to have that additional program 
designated as an eligible program of that institution if the additional 
program--
    (i) Leads to an associate, baccalaureate, professional, or graduate 
degree; or
    (ii)(A) Prepares students for gainful employment in the same or 
related recognized occupation as an educational program that has 
previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution by 
the Secretary; and
    (B) Is at least 8 semester hours, 12 quarter hours, or 600 clock 
hours.
    (3) If an institution incorrectly determines under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section that an educational program satisfies the applicable 
statutory and regulatory eligibility provisions without applying to the 
Secretary for approval, the institution is liable to repay to the 
Secretary all HEA program funds received by the institution for that 
educational program, and all the title IV, HEA program funds received by 
or on behalf of students who were enrolled in that educational program.
    (d) Duration of eligibility. (1) If an institution participates in 
the title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary's designation of the 
institution as an eligible institution under the title IV, HEA programs 
expires when the institution's program participation agreement, as 
described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, expires.
    (2) If an institution participates in an HEA program other than a 
title IV, HEA program, the Secretary's designation of the institution as 
an eligible institution, for purposes of that non-title IV, HEA program, 
does not expire as long as the institution continues to satisfy the 
statutory and regulatory requirements governing its eligibility.
    (e) Consequence of eligibility. (1) If, as a part of its 
institutional eligibility application, an institution indicates that it 
wishes to participate in a title IV, HEA program and the Secretary 
determines that the institution satisfies the applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements governing institutional eligibility, the 
Secretary will determine whether the institution satisfies the standards 
of administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 
34 CFR part 668, subpart B.
    (2) If, as part of its institutional eligibility application, an 
institution indicates that it does not wish to participate in any title 
IV, HEA program and the Secretary determines that the institution 
satisfies the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements governing 
institutional eligibility, the institution is eligible to apply to 
participate in any HEA program listed by the Secretary in the 
eligibility notice it receives under Sec. 600.21. However, the 
institution is not eligible to participate in those programs, or receive 
funds under those programs, merely by virtue of its designation as an 
eligible institution under this part.

Sec. 600.11  Special rules regarding institutional accreditation or preaccreditation.

    (a) Change of accrediting agencies. For purposes of 
Secs. 600.4(a)(5)(i), 600.5(a)(6), and 600.6(a)(5)(i), the Secretary 
does not recognize the accreditation or preaccreditation of an otherwise 
eligible institution if that institution is in the process of changing 
its accrediting agency, unless the institution provides to the 
Secretary--
    (1) All materials related to its prior accreditation or 
preaccreditation; and
    (2) Materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing its 
accrediting agency.

[[Page 186]]

    (b) Multiple accreditation. The Secretary does not recognize the 
accreditation or preaccreditation of an otherwise eligible institution 
if that institution is accredited or preaccredited as an institution by 
more than one accrediting agency, unless the institution--
    (1) Provides to each such accrediting agency and the Secretary the 
reasons for that multiple accreditation or preaccreditation;
    (2) Demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for that multiple 
accreditation or preaccreditation; and
    (3) Designates to the Secretary which agency's accreditation or 
preaccreditation the institution uses to establish its eligibility under 
this part.
    (c) Loss of accreditation or preaccreditation. (1) An institution 
may not be considered eligible for 24 months after it has had its 
accreditation or preaccreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise 
terminated for cause, unless the accrediting agency that took that 
action rescinds that action.
    (2) An institution may not be considered eligible for 24 months 
after it has withdrawn voluntarily from its accreditation or 
preaccreditation status under a show-cause or suspension order issued by 
an accrediting agency, unless that agency rescinds its order.
    (d) Religious exception. (1) If an otherwise eligible institution 
loses its accreditation or preaccreditation, the Secretary considers the 
institution to be accredited or preaccredited for purposes of complying 
with the provisions of Secs. 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6 if the Secretary 
determines that its loss of accreditation or preaccreditation--
    (i) Is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the 
institution; and
    (ii) Is not related to its failure to satisfy the accrediting 
agency's standards.
    (2) If the Secretary considers an unaccredited institution to be 
accredited or preaccredited under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, the Secretary will consider that unaccredited institution 
to be accredited or preaccredited for a period sufficient to allow the 
institution to obtain alternative accreditation or preaccreditation, 
except that period may not exceed 18 months.

<R05>
Sec. 600.20  Application procedures for establishing, reestablishing, maintaining, or expanding institutional eligibility and certification.

    (a) Initial eligibility application. An institution that wishes to 
establish its eligibility to participate in any HEA program must submit 
an application to the Secretary for a determination that it qualifies as 
an eligible institution under this part. If the institution also wishes 
to be certified to participate in the title IV, HEA programs, it must 
indicate that intent on the application, and submit all the 
documentation indicated on the application to enable the Secretary to 
determine that it satisfies the relevant certification requirements 
contained in 34 CFR part 668, subparts B and L.
    (b) Reapplication. (1) A currently designated eligible institution 
that is not participating in the title IV, HEA programs must apply to 
the Secretary for a determination that the institution continues to meet 
the requirements in this part if the Secretary requests the institution 
to reapply. If the institution wishes to be certified to participate in 
the title IV, HEA programs, it must submit an application to the 
Secretary and must submit all the supporting documentation indicated on 
the application to enable the Secretary to determine that it satisfies 
the relevant certification requirements contained in subparts B and L of 
34 CFR part 668.
    (2) A currently designated eligible institution that participates in 
the title IV, HEA programs must apply to the Secretary for a 
determination that the institution continues to meet the requirements in 
this part and in 34 CFR part 668 if the institution wishes to--
    (i) Continue to participate in the title IV, HEA programs beyond the 
scheduled expiration of the institution's current eligibility and 
certification designation;
    (ii) Reestablish eligibility and certification as a private 
nonprofit, private

[[Page 187]]

for-profit, or public institution following a change in ownership that 
results in a change in control as described in Sec. 600.31; or
    (iii) Reestablish eligibility and certification after the 
institution changes its status as a proprietary, nonprofit, or public 
institution.
    (c) Application to expand eligibility. A currently designated 
eligible institution that wishes to expand the scope of its eligibility 
and certification and disburse title IV, HEA Program funds to students 
enrolled in that expanded scope must apply to the Secretary and wait for 
approval to--
    (1) Add a location at which the institution offers or will offer 50 
percent or more of an educational program if one of the following 
conditions applies, otherwise it must report to the Secretary under 
Sec. 600.21:
    (i) The institution participates in the title IV, HEA programs under 
a provisional certification, as provided in 34 CFR 668.13.
    (ii) The institution receives title IV, HEA program funds under the 
reimbursement or cash monitoring payment method, as provided in 34 CFR 
part 668, subpart K.
    (iii) The institution acquires the assets of another institution 
that provided educational programs at that location during the preceding 
year and participated in the title IV, HEA programs during that year.
    (iv) The institution would be subject to a loss of eligibility under 
34 CFR 668.188 if it adds that location.
    (v) The Secretary previously notified the institution that it must 
apply for approval of an additional location.
    (2) Increase its level of program offering (e.g., adding graduate 
degree programs when it previously offered only baccalaureate degree 
programs);
    (3) Add an educational program if the institution is required to 
apply to the Secretary for approval under Sec. 600.10(c);
    (4) Add a branch campus at a location that is not currently included 
in the institution's eligibility and certification designation; or
    (5) Convert an eligible location to a branch campus.
    (d) Application format. To satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 
(a), (b), and (c) of this section, an institution must apply in a format 
prescribed by the Secretary for that purpose and provide all the 
information and documentation requested by the Secretary to make a 
determination of its eligibility and certification.
    (e) Secretary's response to applications. (1) If the Secretary 
receives an application under paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of this section, 
the Secretary notifies the institution--
    (i) Whether the applicant institution qualifies in whole or in part 
as an eligible institution under the appropriate provisions in 
Secs. 600.4 through 600.7; and
    (ii) Of the locations and educational programs that qualify as the 
eligible institution if only a portion of the applicant qualifies as an 
eligible institution;
    (2) If the Secretary receives an application under paragraphs (a) or 
(b) of this section and that institution applies to participate in the

participate;
    (iii) Of the title IV, HEA programs in which it is eligible to apply

    (3) If the Secretary receives an application under paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, the Secretary notifies the institution whether it 
continues to be certified, or whether it reestablished its eligibility 
and certification to participate in the title IV, HEA programs and the 
scope of such approval.
    (4) If the Secretary receives an application under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section for an additional location, the Secretary notifies the 
institution whether the location is eligible or ineligible to 
participate in the title IV, HEA programs, and the date of eligibility 
if the location is determined eligible;
    (5) If the Secretary receives an application under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section for an increase in the level of program offering, or for 
an additional educational program under paragraph

[[Page 188]]

(c)(3) of this section, the Secretary notifies the institution whether 
the program qualifies as an eligible program, and if the program 
qualifies, the date of eligibility; and
    (6) If the Secretary receives an application under paragraphs (c)(4) 
or (c)(5) of this section to have a branch campus certified to 
participate in the title IV, HEA programs as a branch campus, the 
Secretary notifies the institution whether that branch campus is 
certified to participate and the date that the branch campus is eligible 
to begin participation.
    (f) Disbursement rules related to applications. (1)(i) Except as 
provided under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section and 34 CFR 668.26, 
if an institution submits an application under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section because its participation period is scheduled to expire, 
after that expiration date the institution may not disburse title IV, 
HEA program funds to students attending that institution until the 
institution receives the Secretary's notification that the institution 
is again eligible to participate in those programs.
    (ii) An institution described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section 
may disburse title IV, HEA program funds to its students if the 
institution submits to the Secretary a materially complete renewal 
application in accordance with the provisions of 34 CFR 668.13(b)(2), 
and has not received a final decision from the Department on that 
application.
    (2)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section 
and 34 CFR 668.26, if a private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public 
institution submits an application under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section because it has undergone or will undergo a 
change in ownership that results in a change of control or a change in 
status, the institution may not disburse title IV, HEA program funds to 
students attending that institution after the change of ownership or 
status until the institution receives the Secretary's notification that 
the institution is eligible to participate in those programs.
    (ii) An institution described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section 
may disburse title IV, HEA program funds to its students if the 
Secretary issues a provisional extension of certification under 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) If an institution must apply to the Secretary under paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section, the institution may not disburse 
title IV, HEA program funds to students attending the subject location, 
program, or branch until the institution receives the Secretary's 
notification that the location, program, or branch is eligible to 
participate in the title IV, HEA programs.
    (4) If an institution applies to the Secretary under paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section to convert an eligible location to a branch 
campus, the institution may continue to disburse title IV, HEA program 
funds to students attending that eligible location.
    (5) If an institution does not apply to the Secretary to obtain the 
Secretary's approval of a new location, program, increased level of 
program offering, or branch, and the location, program, or branch does 
not qualify as an eligible location, program, or branch of that 
institution under this part and 34 CFR part 668, the institution is 
liable for all title IV, HEA program funds it disburses to students 
enrolled at that location or branch or in that program.
    (g) Application for provisional extension of certification. (1) If a 
private nonprofit institution, a private for-profit institution, or a 
public institution participating in the title IV, HEA programs undergoes 
a change in ownership that results in a change of control as described 
in 34 CFR 600.31, the Secretary may continue the institution's 
participation in those programs on a provisional basis, if the 
institution under the new ownership submits a ``materially complete 
application'' that is received by the Secretary no later than 10 
business days after the day the change occurs.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a private nonprofit institution, a 
private for-profit institution, or a public institution submits a 
materially complete application if it submits a fully completed 
application form designated by the Secretary supported by--
    (i) A copy of the institution's State license or equivalent document

as of the day before the change in ownership--authorized or will 
authorize the institution to provide a program of postsecondary 
education in the State in which it is physically located;
    (ii) A copy of the document from the institution's accrediting 
association that--as of the day before the change in ownership--granted

recently completed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in 
accordance with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.23; and

information for that owner that is acceptable to the Secretary.
    (h) Terms of the extension. (1) If the Secretary approves the 
institution's materially complete application, the Secretary provides 
the institution with a provisional Program Participation Agreement 
(PPA). The provisional PPA extends the terms and conditions of the 
program participation agreement that were in effect for the institution 
before its change of ownership.
    (2) The provisional PPA expires on the earlier of--
    (i) The date on which the Secretary signs a new program 
participation agreement;
    (ii) The date on which the Secretary notifies the institution that

change occurs, of any change in the following:
    (1) Its name, the name of a branch, or the name of a previously 
reported location.
    (2) Its address, the address of a branch, or the address of a 
previously reported location.

    (4) The way it measures program length (e.g., from clock hours to 
credit hours, or from semester hours to quarter hours).
    (5) A decrease in the level of program offering (e.g. the 
institution drops its graduate programs).

[[Page 190]]

    (6) A person's ability to affect substantially the actions of the

Secretary considers a person to have this ability if the person--
    (i) Holds alone or together with another member or members of his or 
her family, at least a 25 percent ``ownership interest'' in the 
institution as defined in Sec. 600.31(b);
    (ii) Represents or holds, either alone or together with other 
persons, under a voting trust, power of attorney, proxy, or similar 
agreement at least a 25 percent ``ownership interest'' in the

institution if any reported changes affects the institution's 
eligibility, and the effective date of that change.
    (d) Disbursement rules related to additional locations. When an 
institution must report to the Secretary about an additional location 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the institution may not disburse 
title IV, HEA funds to students at that location before it reports to 
the Secretary about that location. Unless it is an institution that must 
apply to the Secretary under Sec. 600.20(c)(1), once it reports to the 
Secretary about that location, the institution may disburse those funds 
to those students if that location is licensed and accredited.
    (e) Consequence of failure to report. An institution's failure to 
inform the Secretary of a change described in paragraph (a) of this 
section within the time period stated in that paragraph may result in 
adverse action against the institution.

in the title IV, HEA programs, the institution must demonstrate to the 
Secretary that after the change in ownership and control--
    (i) The institution satisfies all the applicable requirements 
contained in Secs. 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6, except that if the 
institution is a proprietary institution of higher education or

is the corporation or partnership that controls the specified 
corporation directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
    Person. Person includes a legal person (corporation or partnership) 
or an individual.
    Wholly-owned subsidiary. A wholly-owned subsidiary is one 
substantially all of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by 
its parent together with the parent's other wholly-owned subsidiaries.
    (c) Standards for identifying changes of ownership and control--(1) 
Closely-held corporation. A change in ownership and control occurs when-
-
    (i) A person acquires more than 50 percent of the total outstanding 
voting stock of the corporation;
    (ii) A person who holds an ownership interest in the corporation 
acquires control of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock 
of the corporation; or
    (iii) A person who holds or controls 50 percent or more of the total 
outstanding stock of the corporation ceases to hold or control that 
proportion of the stock of the corporation.
    (2) Publicly traded corporations required to be registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A change in ownership and 
control occurs when--
    (i) A person acquires such ownership and control of the corporation 
so that the corporation is required to file a Form 8K with the SEC 
notifying that agency of the change in control; or
    (ii) (A) A person who is a controlling shareholder of the 
corporation ceases

[[Page 192]]

to be a controlling shareholder. A controlling shareholder is a 
shareholder who holds or controls through agreement both 25 percent or 
more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more 
shares of voting stock than any other shareholder. A controlling 
shareholder for this purpose does not include a shareholder whose sole 
stock ownership is held as a U.S. institutional investor, as defined in 
17 CFR 240.15a-6(b)(7), held in mutual funds, held through a profit-
sharing plan, or held in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
    (B) When a change of ownership occurs as a result of paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the institution may submit its most 
recent quarterly financial statement as filed with the SEC, along with 
copies of all other SEC filings made after the close of the fiscal year 
for which a compliance audit has been submitted to the Department of 
Education, instead of the ``same day'' balance sheet.
    (C) If a publicly-traded institution is provisionally certified due 
to a change in ownership under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and 
that institution experiences another change of ownership under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section, an approval of the subsequent change in 
ownership does not extend the original expiration date for the 
provisional certification provided that any current controlling 
shareholder was listed on the change of ownership application for which 
the original provisional approval was granted.
    (3) Other corporations. A change in ownership and control of a 
corporation that is neither closely-held nor required to be registered 
with the SEC occurs when--
    (i) A person who has or acquires an ownership interest acquires both 
control of at least 25 percent of the total outstanding voting stock of 
the corporation and control of the corporation;
    (ii) A person who holds both ownership or control of at least 25 
percent of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and 
control of the corporation, ceases to own or control that proportion of 
the stock of the corporation, or to control the corporation; or
    (iii) For a membership corporation, a person who is or becomes a 
member acquires or loses control of 25 percent of the voting interests 
of the corporation and control of the corporation.
    (4) Partnership or sole proprietorship. A change in ownership and 
control occurs when a person who has or acquires an ownership interest 
acquires or loses control as described in this section.
    (5) Parent corporation. An institution that is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary changes ownership and control when the parent corporation 
changes ownership and control as described in this section.
    (6) Nonprofit institution. A nonprofit institution changes ownership 
and control when a change takes place that is described in paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (7) Public institution. The Secretary does not consider that a 
public institution undergoes a change in ownership that results in a 
change of control if there is a change in governance and the institution 
after the change remains a public institution, provided--
    (i) The new governing authority is in the same State as included in 
the institution's program participation agreement; and
    (ii) The new governing authority has acknowledged the public 
institution's continued responsibilities under its program participation 
agreement.
    (d) Covered transactions. For the purposes of this section, a change 
in ownership of an institution that results in a change of control may 
include, but is not limited to--
    (1) The sale of the institution;
    (2) The transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the 
institution or its parent corporation;
    (3) The merger of two or more eligible institutions;
    (4) The division of one institution into two or more institutions;
    (5) The transfer of the liabilities of an institution to its parent 
corporation;
    (6) A transfer of assets that comprise a substantial portion of the 
educational business of the institution, except where the transfer 
consists exclusively in the granting of a security interest in those 
assets; or

[[Page 193]]

    (7) A change in status as a for-profit, nonprofit, or public 
institution.
    (e) Excluded transactions. A change in ownership and control 
otherwise subject to this section does not include a transfer of 
ownership and control upon the retirement or death of the owner, to--
    (1) A member of the owner's family, as described in Sec. 600.30(f);
    (2) A person with an ownership interest in the institution who has 
been involved in management of the institution for at least two years 
preceding the transfer.

proposed action, unless the designated department official receives by 
that date a request for a hearing or written material that demonstrates 
that the termination and limitation should not take place.
    (2) Once a termination under this section becomes final, the 
termination is effective with respect to any commitment, delivery, or 
disbursement of funds provided under an applicable title IV, HEA program 
by the institution--
    (i) Made to students enrolled in the ineligible institution,

disbursement of funds under the applicable title IV, HEA program by the 
institution--

[[Page 196]]

    (1) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of

the institution is eligible to apply for participation, except that the 
Secretary may specify a shorter period of eligibility. In the case of a 
foreign graduate medical school, continued eligibility is dependent upon 
annual submission of the data and information required under 
Sec. 600.55(a)(5)(i), subject to the terms described in Sec. 600.53(b).
    (b) A foreign institution that has been determined eligible loses 
its eligibility on the date that the institution no longer meets any of 
the criteria in this subpart E.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of 34 CFR 668.26, if a foreign 
institution loses its eligibility under this subpart E, an otherwise 
eligible student, continuously enrolled at the institution before the 
loss of eligibility, may receive an FFEL program loan for attendance at 
that institution for the academic year succeeding the academic year in 
which that institution lost its eligibility, if the student actually 
received an FFEL program loan for attendance at the institution for a 
period during which the institution was eligible under this subpart E.

<R05>
Sec. 602.16  Accreditation and preaccreditation standards.

    (a) The agency must demonstrate that it has standards for 
accreditation, and preaccreditation, if offered, that are sufficiently 
rigorous to ensure that the agency is a reliable authority regarding the 
quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or

    (1) The agency's accreditation standards effectively address the 
quality of the institution or program in the following areas:
    (i) Success with respect to student achievement in relation to the 
institution's mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of 
course completion, State licensing examination, and job placement rates.

    (2) The agency's preaccreditation standards, if offered, are 
appropriately related to the agency's accreditation standards and do not 
permit the institution or program to hold preaccreditation status for 
more than five years.
    (b) If the agency only accredits programs and does not serve as an 
institutional accrediting agency for any of those programs, its 
accreditation standards must address the areas in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section in terms of the type and level of the program rather than 
in terms of the institution.
    (c) If none of the institutions an agency accredits participates in 
any Title IV, HEA program, or if the agency only accredits programs 
within institutions that are accredited by a nationally recognized 
institutional accrediting agency, the agency is not required to have the 
accreditation standards described in paragraphs (a)(1)(viii) and 
(a)(1)(x) of this section.
    (d) An agency that has established and applies the standards in 
paragraph (a) of this section may establish any additional accreditation

<R05>
Sec. 602.21  Review of standards.

    (a) The agency must maintain a systematic program of review that 
demonstrates that its standards are adequate to evaluate the quality of 
the education or training provided by the institutions and programs it 
accredits and relevant to the educational or training needs of students.
    (b) The agency determines the specific procedures it follows in 
evaluating its standards, but the agency must ensure that its program of 
review--
    (1) Is comprehensive;

[[Page 206]]

    (2) Occurs at regular, yet reasonable, intervals or on an ongoing

program of review, that it needs to make changes to its standards, the 
agency must initiate action within 12 months to make the changes and 
must complete that action within a reasonable period of time. Before 
finalizing any changes to its standards, the agency must--
    (1) Provide notice to all of the agency's relevant constituencies, 
and other parties who have made their interest known to the agency, of 
the changes the agency proposes to make;

               Required Operating Policies and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 602.22  Substantive change.

    (a) If the agency accredits institutions, it must maintain adequate 
substantive change policies that ensure that any substantive change to 
the educational mission, program, or programs of an institution after 
the agency has accredited or preaccredited the institution does not 
adversely affect the capacity of the institution to continue to meet the 
agency's standards. The agency meets this requirement if--
    (1) The agency requires the institution to obtain the agency's 
approval of the substantive change before the agency includes the change 
in the scope of accreditation or preaccreditation it previously granted 
to the institution; and
    (2) The agency's definition of substantive change includes at least 
the following types of change:
    (i) Any change in the established mission or objectives of the 
institution.
    (ii) Any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership 
of the institution.
    (iii) The addition of courses or programs that represent a 
significant departure, in either content or method of delivery, from 
those that were offered when the agency last evaluated the institution.
    (iv) The addition of courses or programs at a degree or credential 
level above that which is included in the institution's current 
accreditation or preaccreditation.
    (v) A change from clock hours to credit hours.
    (vi) A substantial increase in the number of clock or credit hours 
awarded for successful completion of a program.
    (vii) The establishment of an additional location geographically 
apart from the main campus at which the institution offers at least 50 
percent of an educational program.
    (b) The agency may determine the procedures it uses to grant prior 
approval of the substantive change. Except as provided in paragraph (c) 
of this section, these may, but need not, require a visit by the agency.
    (c) If the agency's accreditation of an institution enables the 
institution to seek eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA 
programs, the agency's procedures for the approval of an additional 
location described in paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of this section must 
determine if the institution has the fiscal and administrative capacity 
to operate the additional location. In addition, the agency's procedures 
must include--
    (1) A visit, within six months, to each additional location the 
institution establishes, if the institution--
    (i) Has a total of three or fewer additional locations;
    (ii) Has not demonstrated, to the agency's satisfaction, that it has 
a proven record of effective educational oversight of additional 
locations; or
    (iii) Has been placed on warning, probation, or show cause by the 
agency or is subject to some limitation by the agency on its 
accreditation or preaccreditation status;

[[Page 207]]

    (2) An effective mechanism for conducting, at reasonable intervals, 
visits to additional locations of institutions that operate more than 
three additional locations; and
    (3) An effective mechanism, which may, at the agency's discretion, 
include visits to additional locations, for ensuring that accredited and 
preaccredited institutions that experience rapid growth in the number of 
additional locations maintain educational quality.
    (d) The purpose of the visits described in paragraph (c) of this 
section is to verify that the additional location has the personnel, 
facilities, and resources it claimed to have in its application to the 
agency for approval of the additional location.

    (3) Review in a timely, fair, and equitable manner, and apply 
unbiased judgment to, any complaints against itself and take follow-up 
action, as appropriate, based on the results of its review.
    (d) If an institution or program elects to make a public disclosure 
of its accreditation or preaccreditation status, the agency must ensure 
that the institution or program discloses that status accurately, 
including the specific academic or instructional programs covered by 
that status and the name, address, and telephone number of the agency.
    (e) The accrediting agency must provide for the public correction of 
incorrect or misleading information an accredited or preaccredited 
institution or program releases about--
    (1) The accreditation or preaccreditation status of the institution 
or program;
    (2) The contents of reports of on-site reviews; and
    (3) The agency's accrediting or preaccrediting actions with respect

deems necessary to determine that the branch campus has sufficient 
educational, financial, operational, management, and physical resources 
to meet the agency's standards.
    (3) The agency must undertake a site visit to the branch campus as 
soon as practicable, but no later than six months after the 
establishment of that campus.
    (b) Change in ownership. The agency must undertake a site visit to 
an institution that has undergone a change of ownership that resulted in 
a change of control as soon as practicable, but no later than six months 
after the change of ownership.
    (c) Teach-out agreements. (1) The agency must require an institution 
it accredits or preaccredits that enters into a teach-out agreement with 
another institution to submit that teach-out agreement to the agency for 
approval.
    (2) The agency may approve the teach-out agreement only if the 
agreement is between institutions that are accredited or preaccredited 
by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, is consistent with 
applicable standards and regulations, and provides for the equitable 
treatment of students by ensuring that--
    (i) The teach-out institution has the necessary experience, 
resources, and support services to provide an educational program that 
is of acceptable quality and reasonably similar in content, structure, 
and scheduling to that provided by the closed institution; and
    (ii) The teach-out institution demonstrates that it can provide

authorizes Department staff to observe its site visits and decision 
meetings and to gain access to agency records, personnel, and facilities 
on an announced or unannounced basis.
    (c) The Secretary does not make available to the public any 
confidential agency materials a Department employee reviews during the 
evaluation of either the agency's application for recognition or the 
agency's compliance with the criteria for recognition.

<R05>
Sec. 602.31  How does Department staff review an agency's application?

    (a) Upon receipt of an agency's application for either initial or 
continued recognition, Department staff--

[[Page 211]]

    (1) Establishes a schedule for the review of the agency by 
Department staff, the National Advisory Committee on Institutional 
Quality and Integrity, and the Secretary;
    (2) Publishes a notice of the agency's application in the Federal 
Register, inviting the public to comment on the agency's compliance with 
the criteria for recognition and establishing a deadline for receipt of 
public comment; and
    (3) Provides State licensing or authorizing agencies, all currently 
recognized accrediting agencies, and other appropriate organizations 
with copies of the Federal Register notice.
    (b) Department staff analyzes the agency's application to determine 
whether the agency satisfies the criteria for recognition, taking into 
account all available relevant information concerning the compliance of 
the agency with those criteria and any deficiencies in the agency's 
performance with respect to the criteria. The analysis includes--
    (1) Site visits, on an announced or unannounced basis, to the agency 
and, at the Secretary's discretion, to some of the institutions or 
programs it accredits or preaccredits;
    (2) Review of the public comments and other third-party information 
the Department staff receives by the established deadline, as well as 
any other information Department staff assembles for purposes of 
evaluating the agency under this part; and
    (3) Review of complaints or legal actions involving the agency.
    (c) Department staff's evaluation may also include a review of 
information directly related to institutions or programs accredited or 
preaccredited by the agency relative to their compliance with the 
agency's standards, the effectiveness of the standards, and the agency's 
application of those standards.
    (d) If, at any point in its evaluation of an agency seeking initial 
recognition, Department staff determines that the agency fails to 
demonstrate substantial compliance with the basic eligibility 
requirements in Secs. 602.10 through 602.13, the staff--
    (1) Returns the agency's application and provides the agency with an 
explanation of the deficiencies that caused staff to take that action; 
and
    (2) Recommends that the agency withdraw its application and reapply 
when the agency can demonstrate compliance.
    (e) Except with respect to an application that is withdrawn under 
paragraph (d) of this section, when Department staff completes its 
evaluation of the agency, the staff--
    (1) Prepares a written analysis of the agency, which includes a 
recognition recommendation;
    (2) Sends the analysis and all supporting documentation, including 
all third-party comments the Department received by the established 
deadline, to the agency no later than 45 days before the Advisory 
Committee meeting; and
    (3) Invites the agency to provide a written response to the staff 
analysis and third-party comments, specifying a deadline for the 
response that is at least two weeks before the Advisory Committee 
meeting.
    (f) If Department staff fails to provide the agency with the 
materials described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section at least 45 days 
before the Advisory Committee meeting, the agency may request that the 
Advisory Committee defer acting on the application at that meeting. If 
Department staff's failure to send the materials at least 45 days before 
the Advisory Committee meeting is due to the failure of the agency to 
submit reports or other information the Secretary requested by the 
deadline the Secretary established, the agency forfeits its right to 
request a deferral.
    (g) Department staff reviews any response to the staff analysis that 
the agency submits. If necessary, Department staff prepares an addendum 
to the staff analysis and provides the agency with a copy.
    (h) Before the Advisory Committee meeting, Department staff provides 
the Advisory Committee with the following information:
    (1) The agency's application for recognition and supporting 
documentation.
    (2) The Department staff analysis of the agency.
    (3) Any written third-party comments the Department received about

[[Page 212]]

the agency on or before the established deadline.
    (4) Any agency response to either the Department staff analysis or 
third-party comments.
    (5) Any addendum to the Department staff analysis.
    (6) Any other information Department staff relied on in developing 
its analysis.
    (i) At least 30 days before the Advisory Committee meeting, the 
Department publishes a notice of the meeting in the Federal Register 
inviting interested parties, including those who submitted third-party 
comments concerning the agency's compliance with the criteria for 
recognition, to make oral presentations before the Advisory Committee.

<R05>
Sec. 602.32  What is the role of the Advisory Committee and the senior Department official in the review of an agency's application?

    (a) The Advisory Committee considers an agency's application for 
recognition at a public meeting and invites Department staff, the 
agency, and other interested parties to make oral presentations at the 
meeting. A transcript is made of each Advisory Committee meeting.
    (b) When it concludes its review, the Advisory Committee recommends 
that the Secretary either approve or deny recognition or that the 
Secretary defer a decision on the agency's application for recognition.
    (1)(i) The Advisory Committee recommends approval of recognition if 
the agency complies with the criteria for recognition listed in subpart 
B of this part and if the agency is effective in its performance with 
respect to those criteria.
    (ii) If the Advisory Committee recommends approval, the Advisory 
Committee also recommends a recognition period and a scope of 
recognition.
    (iii) If the recommended scope or period of recognition is less than 
that requested by the agency, the Advisory Committee explains its 
reasons for recommending the lesser scope or recognition period.
    (2)(i) If the agency fails to comply with the criteria for 
recognition in subpart B of this part, or if the agency is not effective 
in its performance with respect to those criteria, the Advisory 
Committee recommends denial of recognition, unless the Advisory 
Committee concludes that a deferral under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section is warranted.
    (ii) If the Advisory Committee recommends denial, the Advisory 
Committee specifies the reasons for its recommendation, including all 
criteria the agency fails to meet and all areas in which the agency

Sec. 603.24  Criteria for State agencies.

    The following are the criteria which the Secretary will utilize in 
designating a State agency as a reliable authority to assess the quality 
of public postsecondary vocational education in its respective State.
    (a) Functional aspects. The functional aspects of the State agency 
must be shown by:
    (1) Its scope of operations. The agency:
    (i) Is statewide in the scope of its operations and is legally 
authorized to approve public postsecondary vocational institutions or 
programs;
    (ii) Clearly sets forth the scope of its objectives and activities, 
both as to kinds and levels of public postsecondary vocational 
institutions or programs covered, and the kinds of operations performed;
    (iii) Delineates the process by which it differentiates among and 
approves programs of varying levels.
    (2) Its organization. The State agency:
    (i) Employs qualified personnel and uses sound procedures to carry 
out its operations in a timely and effective manner;
    (ii) Receives adequate and timely financial support, as shown by its 
appropriations, to carry out its operations;
    (iii) Selects competent and knowledgeable persons, qualified by 
experience and training, and selects such persons in accordance with 
nondiscriminatory practices, (A) to participate on visiting teams, (B) 
to engage in consultative services for the evaluation and approval 
process, and (C) to serve on decision-making bodies.
    (3) Its procedures. The State agency:
    (i) Maintains clear definitions of approval status and has developed 
written procedures for granting, reaffirming, revoking, denying, and 
reinstating approval status;
    (ii) Requires, as an integral part of the approval and reapproval 
process, institutional or program self-analysis and onsite reviews by 
visiting teams, and provides written and consultative guidance to 
institutions or programs and visiting teams.
    (A) Self-analysis shall be a qualitative assessment of the strengths 
and limitations of the instructional program, including the achievement 
of institutional or program objectives, and should involve a 
representative portion of the institution's administrative staff, 
teaching faculty, students, governing body, and other appropriate 
constituencies.
    (B) The visiting team, which includes qualified examiners other than 
agency staff, reviews instructional content, methods and resources, 
administrative management, student services, and facilities. It prepares 
written reports and recommendations for use by the State agency.
    (iii) Reevaluates at reasonable and regularly scheduled intervals 
institutions or programs which it has approved.
    (b) Responsibility and reliability. The responsibility and 
reliability of the State agency will be demonstrated by:
    (1) Its responsiveness to the public interest. The State agency:
    (i) Has an advisory body which provides for representation from 
public employment services and employers, employees, postsecondary 
vocational educators, students, and the general public, including 
minority groups. Among its functions, this structure

[[Page 218]]

provides counsel to the State agency relating to the development of 
standards, operating procedures and policy, and interprets the 
educational needs and manpower projections of the State's public 
postsecondary vocational education system;
    (ii) Demonstrates that the advisory body makes a real and meaningful 
contribution to the approval process;
    (iii) Provides advance public notice of proposed or revised 
standards or regulations through its regular channels of communications, 
supplemented, if necessary, with direct communication to inform 
interested members of the affected community. In addition, it provides 
such persons the opportunity to comment on the standards or regulations 
prior to their adoption;
    (iv) Secures sufficient qualitative information regarding the 
applicant institution or program to enable the institution or program to 
demonstrate that it has an ongoing program of evaluation of outputs 
consistent with its educational goals;
    (v) Encourages experimental and innovative programs to the extent 
that these are conceived and implemented in a manner which ensures the 
quality and integrity of the institution or program;
    (vi) Demonstrates that it approves only those institutions or 
programs which meet its published standards; that its standards, 
policies, and procedures are fairly applied; and that its evaluations 
are conducted and decisions are rendered under conditions that assure an 
impartial and objective judgment;
    (vii) Regularly reviews its standards, policies and procedures in 
order that the evaluative process shall support constructive analysis, 
emphasize factors of critical importance, and reflect the educational 
and training needs of the student;
    (viii) Performs no function that would be inconsistent with the 
formation of an independent judgment of the quality of an educational 
institution or program;
    (ix) Has written procedures for the review of complaints pertaining 
to institutional or program quality as these relate to the agency's 
standards, and demonstrates that such procedures are adequate to provide 
timely treatment of such complaints in a manner fair and equitable to 
the complainant and to the institution or program;
    (x) Annually makes available to the public (A) its policies for 
approval, (B) reports of its operations, and (C) list of institutions or 
programs which it has approved;
    (xi) Requires each approved school or program to report on changes 
instituted to determine continued compliance with standards or 
regulations;
    (xii) Confers regularly with counterpart agencies that have similar 
responsibilities in other and neighboring States about methods and 
techniques that may be used to meet those responsibilities.
    (2) Its assurances that due process is accorded to institutions or 
programs seeking approval. The State agency:
    (i) Provides for adequate discussion during the on-site visit 
between the visiting team and the faculty, administrative staff, 
students, and other appropriate persons;
    (ii) Furnishes as a result of the evaluation visit, a written report 
to the institution or program commenting on areas of strength, areas 
needing improvement, and, when appropriate, suggesting means of 
improvement and including specific areas, if any, where the institution 
or program may not be in compliance with the agency's standards;
    (iii) Provides the chief executive officer of the institution or 
program with opportunity to comment upon the written report and to file 
supplemental materials pertinent to the facts and conclusions in the 
written report of the visiting team before the agency takes action on 
the report;
    (iv) Provides the chief executive officer of the institution with a 
specific statement of reasons for any adverse action, and notice of the 
right to appeal such action before an appeal body designated for that 
purpose;
    (v) Publishes rules of procedure regarding appeals;
    (vi) Continues the approval status of the institution or program 
pending disposition of an appeal;
    (vii) Furnishes the chief executive officer of the institution or 
program with a written decision of the appeal body,

[[Page 219]]

including a statement of its reasons therefor.
    (c) Capacity to foster ethical practices. The State agency must 
demonstrate its capability and willingness to foster ethical practices 
by showing that it:
    (i) Promotes a well-defined set of ethical standards governing 
institutional or programmatic practices, including recruitment, 
advertising, transcripts, fair and equitable student tuition refunds, 
and student placement services;
    (ii) Maintains appropriate review in relation to the ethical 
practices of each approved institution or program.

<R05>
Sec. 606.3  What is an enrollment of needy students?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for the 
purpose of Sec. 606.2(a)(3), an applicant institution has an enrollment 
of needy students if in the base year--
    (1) At least 50 percent of its degree students received student 
financial assistance under one or more of the following programs: 
Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, 
Federal Work-Study, and Federal Perkins Loan; or
    (2) The percentage of its undergraduate degree students who were 
enrolled on at least a half-time basis and received Federal Pell Grants 
exceeded the median percentage of undergraduate degree students who were 
enrolled on at least a half-time basis and received Federal Pell Grants 
at comparable institutions that offer similar instruction.
    (b) The Secretary may waive the requirement contained in paragraph 
(a) of this section if the institution demonstrates that--
    (1) The State provides more than 30 percent of the institution's 
budget and the institution charges not more than $99.00 for tuition and 
fees for an academic year;
    (2) At least 30 percent of the students served by the institution in 
the base year were students from low-income families;
    (3) The institution substantially increases the higher education 
opportunities for low-income students who are also educationally 
disadvantaged, underrepresented in postsecondary education, or minority 
students;
    (4) The institution substantially increases the higher education 
opportunities for individuals who reside in an area that is not included 
in a ``metropolitan statistical area'' as defined by the Office of 
Management and Budget and who are unserved by other postsecondary 
institutions; or
    (5) The institution will, if granted the waiver, substantially 
increase the higher education opportunities for Hispanic Americans.
    (c) For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary 
considers ``low-income'' to be an amount which does not exceed 150 
percent of the amount equal to the poverty level as established by the 
United States Bureau of the Census.

educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent 
undergraduate student in that year of comparable institutions that offer 
similar instruction.
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary determines the average educational and general expenditure per

graduate students that do not differentiate between graduate and 
undergraduate educational and general expenditures by discounting the 
graduate enrollment using a factor of 2.5 times the number of graduate 
students.

a notice in the Federal Register of the average educational and general 
expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student at 
comparable institutions that offer similar instruction.

[[Page 223]]

of this section, if the Secretary determines, based upon persuasive 
evidence provided by the institution, that--

(a) of this section was due to factors which, if used in determining 
compliance with those criteria, distorted that determination; and
    (2) The institution's designation as an eligible institution under 
this part is otherwise consistent with the purposes of this part.
    (d) For the purpose of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary considers that the following factors may distort an

enrichment programs, publications, social clubs, or associations.
    (15) Activities that are operational in nature rather than 
developmental in nature.
    (d) Endowment funds. If a grantee uses part of its grant funds to 
establish or increase an endowment fund, it must comply with the 
provisions of Secs. 628.3, 628.6, 628.10, and 628.41 through 628.47 of 
this chapter with regard to the use of those funds, except--
    (1) The definition of the term ``endowment fund income'' in 
Sec. 628.6 of this chapter does not apply. For the purposes of this 
paragraph (d), ``endowment fund income'' means an amount equal to the 
total value of the fund, including fund appreciation and retained 
interest and dividends, minus the endowment fund corpus;
    (2) Instead of the requirement in Sec. 628.10(a) of this chapter, 
the grantee institution must match each dollar of Federal grant funds 
used to establish or increase an endowment fund with one dollar of non-
Federal funds; and
    (3) Instead of the requirements in Sec. 628.41(a)(3) through (a)(5) 
and the introductory text in Sec. 628.41(b) and Sec. 628.41(b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this chapter, if a grantee institution decides to use any of 
its grant funds for endowment purposes, it must match those grant funds 
immediately with non-Federal funds when it places those funds into its 
endowment fund.

Sec. 607.4  What are low educational and general expenditures?

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for the 
purpose of Sec. 6072(a)(2), an applicant institution's average 
educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent 
undergraduate student in the base year must be less than the average 
educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent 
undergraduate student of comparable institutions that offer similar 
institution in that year.
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary determines the average educational and general expenditure per 
FTE undergraduate student for institutions with graduate students that 
do not differentiate between graduate and undergraduate E&G expenditures 
by discounting the graduate enrollment using a factor of 2.5 times the 
number of graduate students.
    (b) Each year, the Secretary notifies prospective applicants through 
a notice in the Federal Register of the average educational and general 
expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student at 
comparable institutions that offer similar instruction.
    (c) The Secretary may waive the requirement contained in paragraph 
(a) of this section, if the Secretary determines, based upon persuasive 
evidence provided by the institution, that--
    (1) The institution's failure to satisfy the criteria in paragraph 
(a) of this section was due to factors which, if used in determining 
compliance with those criteria, distorted that determination; and
    (2) The institution's designation as an eligible institution under 
this part is otherwise consistent with the purposes of this part.
    (d) For the purpose of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary considers that the following factors

[[Page 235]]

may distort an institution's educational and general expenditures per 
full-time equivalent undergraduate student--
    (1) Low student enrollment;
    (2) Location of the institution in an unusually high cost-of-living 
area;
    (3) High energy costs;
    (4) An increase in State funding that was part of a desegregation 
plan for higher education; or
    (5) Operation of high cost professional schools such as medical or 
dental schools.

Number of Pell Grant recipients at the applicant institution during the 
school year immediately preceding that fiscal year.
________________________________________________________________________
Number of Pell Grant recipients at all applicant institutions during the

    (2) Multiplying twenty-five percent of the amount appropriated for 
the HBCU Program by the following fraction:

Number of graduates of the applicant institution during the school year 
immediately preceding that fiscal year.
________________________________________________________________________
Number of graduates of all applicant institutions during the school year 
immediately preceding that fiscal year.

    (3) Multiplying twenty-five percent of the amount appropriated for

years of graduating with baccalaureate degrees, are in attendance at 
graduate or professional schools and enrolled in degree programs in 
disciplines in which Blacks are underrepresented
________________________________________________________________________
The sum of the percentages of those graduates of all applicant 
institutions.

    (4) Adding the amounts obtained in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (b)(1) For each fiscal year, the numerator in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section is calculated by--
    (i) Determining the number of graduates of an applicant institution 
who, within five years of graduating with baccalaureate degrees, 
attended graduate or professional schools and enrolled in degree 
programs in disciplines in which Blacks are underrepresented during the 
school year immediately preceding that fiscal year; and

application must receive at least $500,000; and
    (2) If the amount appropriated for a fiscal year for the HBCU 
Program is insufficient to provide $500,000 to each eligible institution 
with an approved application, each grant is ratably reduced. If 
additional funds become available for the HBCU Program during a fiscal 
year, each grant is increased on the same basis as it was decreased 
until the grant amount reaches $500,000.
    (d) The amount of any grant that the Secretary determines will not 
be required by a grantee for the period for which the grant was made is 
available for reallotment by the Secretary during that period to other 
eligible institutions under the formula contained in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

    (1) Teach in a high-need school of a high-need LEA for a period of 
time equivalent to the period for which the individual receives the 
scholarship; or
    (2) Repay, as set forth in Sec. 611.43, the Teacher Quality 
Enhancement Grant Program funds provided as a scholarship.
    (b) Content of the scholarship agreement. To implement the service-

scholarship assistance on the

[[Page 267]]

basis of information provided by the grantee under Sec. 611.50.
    (2) The period for which the recipient received scholarship 
assistance is the period during which an individual enrolled in the 
teacher preparation program on a full-time basis, excluding the summer 
period, would have completed the same course of study.
    (b) Calculation of period needed to teach to meet the service 
obligation. (1) The period of the scholarship recipient's service 
obligation is the period of the individual's receipt of scholarship 
assistance as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) The Secretary calculates the period that a scholarship recipient 
must teach in a high-need school of a high-need LEA in order to fulfill 
his or her service obligation by--
    (i) Comparing the period in which the recipient received a 
scholarship as provided in paragraph (a) of this section with the 
information provided by the high-need LEA under Secs. 611.46 and 611.47 
on the period the recipient has taught in one of its high-need schools; 
and
    (ii) Adjusting the period in which the recipient has taught in a 
high-need school to reflect the individual's employment, if any, as a 
teacher on a part-time basis relative to classroom teachers the LEA 
employs on a full-time basis under the LEA's standard yearly contract 
(excluding any summer or intersession period).
    (c) The Secretary adjusts the period of a scholarship recipient's 
service obligation as provided in paragraph (b) of this section to 
reflect information the high-need LEA provides under Secs. 611.46 and 
611.47 that the scholarship recipient also has taught in a high-need 
school in a summer or intersession period.

including the principal balance, accrued interest, and any collection 
costs charged under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section; or
    (ii) Be discharged of any repayment obligation as provided in 
Sec. 611.45.
    (2) Unless the service obligation is deferred as provided in 
Sec. 611.44 or the repayment requirement is discharged, the obligation 
to repay the amount provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section begins 
six months after the date the recipient--
    (i) Completes the teacher training program without beginning to 
teach in a high-need school of a high-need LEA; or
    (ii) Is no longer enrolled in the teacher training program.
    (3) The Secretary determines whether a scholarship recipient has 
fulfilled the service obligation on the basis of information that the 
Department receives as provided in Secs. 611.46 and 611.47.
    (b) Obligation to Repay: Partial performance of the service 
obligation. (1) A scholarship recipient who teaches in a high-need 
school of a high-need school district for less than the period of his or 
her service obligation must repay--
    (i) The amount of the scholarship that is proportional to the unmet 
portion of the service obligation;
    (ii) Interest that accrues on this portion of the scholarship 
beginning six months after the recipient's graduation from the teacher 
preparation program; and
    (iii) Costs of collection, if any.

Secretary, the scholarship recipient may repay the scholarship and 
accrued interest according to a payment schedule that the Secretary 
establishes.
    (2) A payment schedule must permit the full amount of the 
scholarship and accrued interest to be repaid within ten years. The 
minimum monthly payment is $50 unless a larger monthly payment is needed 
to enable the full

[[Page 268]]

amount that is due to be paid within this timeframe.
    (d) Interest. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 34 CFR part 30, 
the Secretary charges interest on the unpaid balance that the 
scholarship recipient owes. However, except as provided in 
Sec. 611.44(d), the Secretary does not charge interest for the period of 
time that precedes the date on which the scholarship recipient is 
required to begin repayment.
    (e) Failure to meet requirements. A scholarship recipient's failure 
to satisfy the requirements of Secs. 611.42-611.48 in a timely manner 
results in the recipient being--
    (1) In non-compliance with the terms of the scholarship;
    (2) Liable for repayment of the scholarship and accrued interest; 
and
    (3) Subject to collection action.
    (f) Action by reason of default. The Secretary may take any action 
authorized by law to collect the amount of scholarship, accrued interest 
and collection costs, if any, on which a scholarship recipient obligated 
to repay under this section has defaulted. This action includes, but is 
not limited to, filing a lawsuit against the recipient, reporting the 
default to national credit bureaus, and requesting the Internal Revenue 
Service to offset the recipient's Federal income tax refund.

<R05>
Sec. 628.31  What selection criteria does the Secretary use in evaluating an application for an endowment challenge grant?

    In evaluating an application for an endowment challenge grant, the 
Secretary uses the following three criteria:
    (a) The Secretary measures the applicant's past efforts to build or 
maintain its existing endowment and quasi-endowment funds by the dollar 
and relative increase in market value to the applicant's existing 
endowment and quasi-endowment funds over the applicant's four fiscal 
years preceding the year of application using the formulas set forth in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.
    (1) In measuring an applicant's dollar increase in its endowment and 
quasi-endowment funds, the Secretary--
    (i) Subtracts from an amount equal to the market value of the 
applicant's endowment and quasi-endowment funds at the end of the four-
year period described in paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal 
to the market value of the applicant's endowment and quasi-endowment 
funds at the beginning of that four-year period; and
    (ii) Divides the result obtained in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section by the applicant's full-time equivalent enrollment at the end of 
the four-year period.
    (2) The Secretary awards points on a sliding scale giving 10 points 
to applicants with the highest dollar increase as calculated in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and no points to applicants with the 
lowest dollar increase.
    (3) In measuring an applicant's relative increase in market value of 
its endowment and quasi-endowment funds, the Secretary--
    (i) Divides an amount equal to the market value of the applicant's 
endowment and quasi-endowment funds at the beginning of the four-year 
period described in paragraph (a) of this section by the applicant's 
full-time equivalent enrollment at the end of the four-year period.
    (ii) Adds $50 to the amount obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section.
    (iii) Divides the result obtained in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section by the amount obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (4)(i) If the amount of endowment per full-time equivalent student 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is $50 or more, the Secretary 
awards points on a sliding scale giving 15 points to applicants with a 
relative increase of 100 percent or more and no points to applicants 
that have had a relative decrease of more than 20 percent.
    (ii) If the amount of endowment per full-time equivalent student 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is less than $50, the 
Secretary awards points on a sliding scale giving 15 points to 
applicants with a relative increase of 100 percent or more and no points 
to applicants that have had no relative increase.
    (5) In measuring the applicant's past effort, the Secretary--
    (i) Excludes real estate from being considered as part of the 
applicant's existing endowment or quasi-endowment fund; and
    (ii) Includes an endowment or quasi-endowment fund operated by a 
foundation if the foundation is tax-exempt and was established for the 
purpose of raising money for the institution.
    (b) The Secretary considers the degree of proposed nongovernmental 
matching funds. (Total: 15 points maximum for the highest proposed 
percentage)
    (1) The Secretary measures the degree to which an applicant proposes 
to match the grant with funds from sources other than a State or local 
government--giving up to 15 points to applicants proposing to obtain the 
largest percentage of matching funds from those nongovermental sources.
    (2) If an applicant is applying for an endowment challenge grant for 
the first time, the Secretary multiplies the maximum number of points 
(i.e., 15 points) on this criterion times the following fraction:

[[Page 278]]

    (3) If an applicant has previously received an endowment challenge 
grant, the Secretary uses the following formula in awarding points under 
this criterion:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.022

    (c) The Secretary considers the need for an endowment challenge 
grant as measured by the applicant's lack of resources.
    (1) The Secretary gives up to 50 points to applicants with the least 
resources as measured, at the end of the applicant's fiscal year 
preceding the year it applies for an endowment challenge grant, by 
revenue per full-time equivalent student it receives from the sum of the 
following--
    (i) Federal, State and local government appropriations;
    (ii) Unrestricted Federal, State and local government grants and 
contracts;
    (iii) Eighty percent of tuition and fees; and
    (iv) Unrestricted and restricted ``endowment income''.
    (2) In measuring the applicant's resources, the Secretary--
    (i) Defines the factors in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) as they 
are defined in the Education Department Higher Education General 
Information Survey of Financial Statistics.
    (ii) Excludes real estate from being considered as part of the 
applicant's existing endowment or quasi-endowment fund.

Sec. 628.32  What funding priorities does the Secretary use in evaluating an application for an endowment challenge grant?

    In evaluating an endowment challenge grant application, the 
Secretary uses the following two priorities:
    (a) Recipient or former recipient of a grant under the Strengthening 
Institutions, Special Needs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, 
Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or 
Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions Program. (Total: 
20 points) The Secretary gives 20 points to each applicant who on 
October 1 of the fiscal year in which the applicant is applying for an 
endowment challenge grant is a current recipient of a planning or 
development grant, or was a recipient of a planning or development grant 
within the five preceding fiscal years, under the Strengthening 
Institutions, Special Needs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, 
Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or 
Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions Program.
    (b) Need for an endowment challenge grant as measured by the lack of 
endowment funds. (Total: 20 points)
    (1) The Secretary gives up to 20 total points to an applicant with 
the greatest need for an endowment challenge grant under this part, as 
measured by the applicant's lack of endowment funds.

[[Page 279]]

    (2) The Secretary gives up to 20 points to the applicant with the 
lowest market value, at the end of the applicant's fiscal year preceding 
the year it applies for an endowment challenge grant, of its existing 
endowment and quasi-endowment fund in relation to the number of full-
time equivalent students enrolled at the institution in the fall of the 
year preceding the year it applies for an endowment challenge grant.
    (3) In measuring the applicant's need for an endowment challenge 
grant, the Secretary excludes real estate from being considered as part 
of the applicant's existing endowment or quasi-endowment fund.

    (b) If an institution obtains at least $25,000 in matching funds and 
raises all the nongovernmental funds it proposed to raise in its 
application, the institution may receive a grant equal to twice the

    (1) $500,000 in any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated for 
the Endowment Challenge Grant Program is less than $15,000,000;

achieve project objectives and to coordinate the Upward Bound project 
with other projects for disadvantaged students;
    (9) The plan to work cooperatively with parents and key 
administrative, teaching, and counseling personnel at the target schools 
to achieve project objectives; and
    (10) A follow-up plan for tracking graduates of Upward Bound as they 
enter and continue in postsecondary education.
    (d) Applicant and community support (16 points). The Secretary 
evaluates the applicant and community support for the proposed project 
on the basis of the extent to which--
    (1) The applicant is committed to supplementing the project with 
resources that enhance the project such as: space, furniture and 
equipment, supplies, and the time and effort of personnel other than 
those employed in the project.
    (2) The applicant has secured written commitments of support from 
schools, community organizations, and businesses, including the 
commitment of resources that will enhance the project as described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

formal training or work experience in fields related to the objectives 
of the project and experience in designing, managing, or implementing 
similar projects;
    (2) The qualifications required of each of the other personnel to be 
used in the project, including formal training or work experience in 
fields related to the objectives of the project;
    (3) The quality of the applicant's plan for employing personnel who

project's target population.
    (f) Budget and cost effectiveness (5 points). The Secretary reviews 
each application to determine the extent to which--
    (1) The budget for the project is adequate to support planned 
project services and activities; and
    (2) Costs are reasonable in relation to the objectives and scope of 
the project.
    (g) Evaluation plan (8 points). The Secretary evaluates the quality 
of the evaluation plan for the project on the basis of the extent to 
which the applicant's methods of evaluation--
    (1) Are appropriate to the project and include both quantitative and 
qualitative evaluation measures; and
    (2) Examine in specific and measurable ways the success of the 
project in making progress toward achieving its process and outcomes

scholarly activities in which participants will be involved;
    (4) (5 points) The plan for involving faculty members in the design 
of research activities in which students will be involved;
    (5) (5 points) The plan for providing internships, seminars, and 
other educational activities designed to prepare undergraduate students 
for doctoral study;
    (6) (5 points) The plan for providing individual or group services 
designed to enhance a student's successful entry into postbaccalaureate 
education;
    (7) (3 points) The plan to inform the institutional community of the 
goals and objectives of the project;
    (8) (8 points) The plan to ensure proper and efficient 
administration of the project, including, but not limited to matters 
such as financial management, student records management, personnel 
management, the organizational structure, and the plan for coordinating 
the McNair project with other programs for disadvantaged students; and
    (9) (5 points) The follow-up plan that will be used to track the 
academic and career accomplishments of participants after they are no 
longer participating in the McNair project.
    (d) Quality of key personnel (9 points). The Secretary evaluates the 
quality of key personnel the applicant plans to use on the project on 
the basis of the following:
    (1)(i) The job qualifications of the project director.
    (ii) The job qualifications of each of the project's other key 
personnel.
    (iii) The quality of the project's plan for employing highly 
qualified persons, including the procedures to be used to employ members 
of groups underrepresented in higher education, including Blacks, 
Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders (including Native Hawaiians).
    (2) In evaluating the qualifications of a person, the Secretary 
considers his or her experience and training in fields related to the 
objectives of the project.
    (e) Adequacy of the resources and budget (15 points). The Secretary 
evaluates the extent to which--
    (1) The applicant's proposed allocation of resources in the budget 
is clearly related to the objectives of the project;
    (2) Project costs and resources, including facilities, equipment, 
and supplies, are reasonable in relation to the objectives and scope of 
the project; and
    (3) The applicant's proposed commitment of institutional resources 
to the McNair participants, as for example, the commitment of time from 
institutional research faculty and the waiver of tuition and fees for 
McNair participants engaged in summer research projects.
    (f) Evaluation plan (7 points). The Secretary evaluates the quality 
of the evaluation plan for the project on the basis of the extent to 
which the applicant's methods of evaluation--
    (1) Are appropriate to the project's objectives;
    (2) Provide for the applicant to determine, in specific and 
measurable ways, the success of the project in--
    (i) Making progress toward achieving its objectives (a formative 
evaluation); and
    (ii) Achieving its objectives at the end of the project period (a 
summative evaluation); and
    (3) Provide for a description of other project outcomes, including 
the use of quantifiable measures, if appropriate.

awarded his or her scholarship or the date the scholar interrupts 
enrollment.
    (2) A scholar who postpones or interrupts his or her enrollment at 
an institution of higher education in accordance with standards 
established by the SEA is not eligible to receive scholarship funds 
during the period of postponement or interruption, but is eligible to 
receive scholarship payments on enrollment or re-enrollment at an 
institution of higher education.
    (3) A scholar's periods of postponement or interruption, taken in 
accordance with standards established by the SEA and not in excess of 12 
months, are not considered periods of suspension for the purposes of 
calculating the 12 months provided for suspension prior to termination 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if an 
SEA finds that a scholar fails to meet the requirements of Sec. 654.51 
within an award year, it shall suspend the scholar's eligibility to 
receive scholarship funds until the scholar is able to demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the SEA that he or she meets these requirements.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a 
scholar's eligibility for a scholarship is terminated when the total of

subsequently determines the scholar was ineligible under the 
requirements in Sec. 654.40 or 654.51 shall repay to the SEA the total 
amount of the scholarship funds received for the period during which he 
or she was ineligible.

payment periods, the

[[Page 415]]

rules in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section are modified

Sec. 668.5  Written arrangements to provide educational programs.

    (a) Written arrangements between eligible institutions. If an 
eligible institution enters into a written arrangement with another 
eligible institution, or with a consortium of eligible institutions, 
under which the other eligible institution or consortium provides all or

institution, the Secretary considers that educational program to be an 
eligible program if it otherwise satisfies the requirements of 
Sec. 668.8.
    (b) Written arrangements for study-abroad. Under a study abroad 
program, if an eligible institution enters into a written arrangement 
with a foreign institution, or an organization acting on behalf of a 
foreign institution, under which the foreign institution provides part 
of the educational program of students enrolled in the eligible 
institution, the Secretary considers that educational program to be an 
eligible program if it otherwise satisfies the requirements of 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section.
    (c) Written arrangements between an eligible institution and an 
ineligible institution or organization. If an eligible institution 
enters into a written arrangement with an institution or organization 
that is not an eligible institution under which the ineligible 
institution or organization provides part of the educational program of 
students enrolled in the eligible institution, the Secretary considers 
that educational program to be an eligible program if--
    (1) The ineligible institution or organization has not had its 
eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs terminated by 
the Secretary, or has not voluntarily withdrawn from participation in 
those programs under a termination, show-cause, suspension, or similar 
type proceeding initiated by the institution's State licensing agency, 
accrediting agency, guarantor, or by the Secretary;
    (2) The educational program otherwise satisfies the requirements of 
Sec. 668.8; and
    (3)(i) The ineligible institution or organization provides not more 
than 25 percent of the educational program; or
    (ii)(A) The ineligible institution or organization provides more 
than 25 percent but not more than 50 percent of the educational program;
    (B) The eligible institution and the ineligible institution or 
organization are not owned or controlled by the same individual, 
partnership, or corporation; and
    (C) The eligible institution's accrediting agency, or if the 
institution is a public postsecondary vocational educational 
institution, the State agency listed in the Federal Register in 
accordance with 34 CFR part 603, has specifically determined that the 
institution's arrangement meets the agency's standards for the 
contracting out of educational services.
    (d) Administration of title IV, HEA programs. (1) If an institution 
enters into a written arrangement as described in paragraph (a), (b), or 
(c) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, the institution at which the student is enrolled as a regular 
student must determine the student's eligibility for title IV, HEA 
program funds, and must calculate and disburse those funds to that 
student.
    (2) In the case of a written arrangement between eligible 
institutions, the institutions may agree in writing to have any eligible 
institution in the written arrangement make those calculations and 
disbursements, and the Secretary does not consider that institution to 
be a third-party servicer for that arrangement.
    (3) The institution that calculates and disburses a student's title 
IV, HEA program assistance under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this 
section must--
    (i) Take into account all the hours in which the student enrolls at 
each institution that apply to the student's degree or certificate when 
determining the student's enrollment status and

[[Page 416]]

cost of attendance; and (ii) Maintain all records regarding the 
student's eligibility for and receipt of title IV, HEA program funds.

refund of 100 percent of their tuition and fees.
    (3) Subtract from the total obtained under paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section the number of students who were enrolled in the program at the 
end of that award year.

<R05>
Sec. 668.13  Certification procedures.

    (a) Requirements for certification. (1) The Secretary certifies an 
institution to participate in the title IV, HEA programs if the

change in control as described in 34 CFR 600.31, the institution must 
require the following individuals to complete title IV, HEA program 
training provided or approved by the Secretary no later than 12 months 
after the institution executes its program participation agreement under

institution meets the standards of this subpart, the Secretary also 
specifies the period for which the institution may participate in a 
Title IV, HEA program. An

[[Page 420]]

institution's period of participation expires six years after the date 
that the Secretary certifies that the institution meets the standards of 
this subpart, except that the Secretary may specify a shorter period.
    (2) Provided that an institution has submitted an application for a 
renewal of certification that is materially complete at least 90 days 
prior to the expiration of its current period of participation, the 
institution's existing certification will be extended on a month to 
month basis following the expiration of the institution's period of 
participation until the end of the month in which the Secretary issues a 
decision on the application for recertification.
    (c) Provisional certification. (1) The Secretary may provisionally 
certify an institution if--
    (i) The institution seeks initial participation in a Title IV, HEA

    (iii) The institution is a participating institution--
    (A) That is applying for a certification that the institution meets 
the standards of this subpart;
    (B) That the Secretary determines has jeopardized its ability to 
perform its financial responsibilities by not meeting the factors of 
financial responsibility under Sec. 668.15 or the standards of 
administrative capability under Sec. 668.16; and
    (C) Whose participation has been limited or suspended under subpart 
G of this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification;
    (iv) The institution seeks a renewal of participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program after the expiration of a prior period of participation in 
that program; or
    (v) The institution is a participating institution that was 
accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting 
agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew the Secretary's 
recognition of that agency according to the provisions contained in 34 
CFR part 603.
    (2) If the Secretary provisionally certifies an institution, the 
Secretary also specifies the period for which the institution may 
participate in a Title IV, HEA program. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(c) (3) and (4) of this section, a provisionally certified institution's 
period of participation expires--
    (i) Not later than the end of the first complete award year 
following the date on which the Secretary provisionally certified the 
institution under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;
    (ii) Not later than the end of the third complete award year 
following the date on which the Secretary provisionally certified the 
institution under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (e)(2) of this 
section; and

for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the Secretary provisionally 
certifies an institution, the Secretary may specify a shorter period of 
participation for that institution.
    (4) For the purposes of this section, ``provisional certification'' 
means that the Secretary certifies that an institution has demonstrated 
to the Secretary's satisfaction that the institution--
    (i) Is capable of meeting the standards of this subpart within a 
specified period; and
    (ii) Is able to meet the institution's responsibilities under its 
program participation agreement, including compliance with any 
additional conditions specified in the institution's program 
participation agreement that the Secretary requires the institution to 
meet in order for the institution to participate under provisional 
certification.
    (d) Revocation of provisional certification. (1) If, before the 
expiration of a provisionally certified institution's period of 
participation in a Title IV, HEA program, the Secretary determines that 
the institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program 
participation agreement, the Secretary

[[Page 421]]

may revoke the institution's provisional certification for participation 
in that program.
    (2)(i) If the Secretary revokes the provisional certification of an

means, if practical.
    (ii) The revocation takes effect on the date that the Secretary 
mails the notice to the institution.
    (iii) The notice states the basis for the revocation, the

facsimile transmission is responsible for confirming that a complete and 
legible copy of the document was received by the Secretary.
    (iv) The Secretary discourages the use of facsimile transmission for 
documents longer than five pages.
    (4)(i) The designated department official making the decision 
concerning an institution's request for reconsideration of a revocation 
is different from, and not subject to supervision by, the official who 
initiated the revocation of the institution's provisional certification. 
The deciding official promptly considers an institution's request for 
reconsideration of a revocation and notifies the institution, by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, of the final decision. The 
Secretary also may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means, 
if practical.
    (ii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation is warranted,

apply for reinstatement of participation only after the later of the 
expiration of--
    (A) Eighteen months after the effective date of the revocation; or

    (iii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation of the 
institution's provisional certification is unwarranted, the Secretary's 
notice informs the institution that the institution's provisional 
certification is reinstated, effective on the date that the Secretary's 
original revocation notice was mailed, for a specified period of time.

the document is recorded as received by facsimile equipment that 
receives the transmission.

Sec. 668.15  Factors of financial responsibility.

    (a) General. To begin and to continue to participate in any Title 
IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that 
the institution is financially responsible under the requirements 
established in this section.
    (b) General standards of financial responsibility. In general, the 
Secretary considers an institution to be financially responsible only if 
it--
    (1) Is providing the services described in its official publications 
and statements;
    (2) Is providing the administrative resources necessary to comply 
with the requirements of this subpart;
    (3) Is meeting all of its financial obligations, including but not 
limited to--
    (i) Refunds that it is required to make; and
    (ii) Repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred 
in programs administered by the Secretary;

[[Page 426]]

    (4) Is current in its debt payments. The institution is not 
considered current in its debt payments if--
    (i) The institution is in violation of any existing loan agreement 
at its fiscal year end, as disclosed in a note to its audited financial 
statement; or
    (ii) the institution fails to make a payment in accordance with 
existing debt obligations for more than 120 days, and at least one 
creditor has filed suit to recover those funds;
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in 
accordance with procedures established by the Secretary, submits to the 
Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit, acceptable and payable to the 
Secretary equal to 25 percent of the total dollar amount of Title IV, 
HEA program refunds paid by the institution in the previous fiscal year;
    (6) Has not had, as part of the audit report for the institution's 
most recently completed fiscal year--
    (i) A statement by the accountant expressing substantial doubt about 
the institution's ability to continue as a going concern; or
    (ii) A disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant;
    (7) For a for-profit institution--
    (i)(A) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, an acid 
test ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this section, the acid test 
ratio shall be calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current 
accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities. 
The calculation of the acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or 
uncollateralized related party receivables;
    (B) Has not had operating losses in either or both of its two latest 
fiscal years that in sum result in a decrease in tangible net worth in 
excess of 10 percent of the institution's tangible net worth at the 
beginning of the first year of the two-year period. The Secretary may 
calculate an operating loss for an institution by excluding from net 
income: extraordinary gains or losses; income or losses from 
discontinued operations; prior period adjustment; and, the cumulative 
effect of changes in accounting principle. For purposes of this section, 
the calculation of tangible net worth shall exclude all assets defined 
as intangible in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles; and
    (C) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible net worth. 
In applying this standard, a positive tangible net worth occurs when the 
institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities. The calculation of 
tangible net worth shall exclude all assets classified as intangible in 
accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles; or
    (ii) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has 
currently issued and outstanding debt obligations that are (without 
insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the 
second highest rating level of credit quality given by a nationally 
recognized statistical rating organization;
    (8) For a nonprofit institution--
    (i)(A) Prepares a classified statement of financial position in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or provides the 
required information in notes to the audited financial statements;
    (B) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, an acid test 
ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this section, the acid test ratio 
shall be calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current 
accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities. 
The calculation of the acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or 
uncollateralized related party receivables.
    (C)(1) Has, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a positive 
unrestricted current fund balance or positive unrestricted net assets. 
In calculating the unrestricted current fund balance or the unrestricted 
net assets for an institution, the Secretary may include funds that are 
temporarily restricted in use by the institution's governing body that 
can be transferred to the current unrestricted fund or added to net 
unrestricted assets at the discretion of the governing body; or
    (2) Has not had, an excess of current fund expenditures over current 
fund revenues over both of its 2 latest fiscal years that results in a 
decrease exceeding 10 percent in either the unrestricted current fund 
balance or the

[[Page 427]]

unrestricted net assets at the beginning of the first year of the 2-year 
period. The Secretary may exclude from net changes in fund balances for 
the operating loss calculation: Extraordinary gains or losses; income or 
losses from discontinued operations; prior period adjustment; and the 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. In calculating the 
institution's unrestricted current fund balance or the unrestricted net 
assets, the Secretary may include funds that are temporarily restricted 
in use by the institution's governing body that can be transferred to 
the current unrestricted fund or added to net unrestricted assets at the 
discretion of the governing body; or
    (ii) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has 
currently issued and outstanding debt obligations which are (without 
insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the 
second highest rating level of credit quality given by a nationally 
recognized statistical rating organization.

Education Fund, as presented in the general purpose financial 
statements;
    (iv) Submits to the Secretary, a statement from the State Auditor 
General that the institution has, during the past year, met all of its 
financial obligations, and that the institution continues to have 
sufficient resources to meet all of its financial obligations; or
    (v) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has 
currently issued and outstanding debt obligations which are (without 
insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the 
second highest rating level of credit quality given by a nationally 
recognized statistical rating organization.
    (c) Past performance of an institution or persons affiliated with an 
institution. An institution is not financially responsible if--
    (1) A person who exercises substantial control over the institution 
or any member or members of the person's family alone or together--
    (i)(A) Exercises or exercised substantial control over another 
institution or a third-party servicer that owes a liability for a 
violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement; or
    (B) Owes a liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program 
requirement; and

CFR part 682) within the preceding five years;
    (ii) Had--
    (A) An audit finding, during its two most recent audits of its 
conduct of the Title IV, HEA programs, that resulted in the 
institution's being required to repay an amount greater than five 
percent of the funds that the institution received under the Title IV, 
HEA programs for any award year covered by the audit; or
    (B) A program review finding, during its two most recent program 
reviews, of its conduct of the Title IV, HEA programs that resulted in 
the institution's being required to repay an amount greater than five 
percent of the funds that the institution received under the Title IV, 
HEA programs for any award year covered by the program review;
    (iii) Been cited during the preceding five years for failure to 
submit acceptable audit reports required under this part or individual 
Title IV, HEA program regulations in a timely fashion; or
    (iv) Failed to resolve satisfactorily any compliance problems 
identified in program review or audit reports based upon a final 
decision of the Secretary issued pursuant to subpart G or subpart H of 
this part.

[[Page 428]]

    (d) Exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility. 
(1)(i) An institution is not required to meet the standard in paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section if the Secretary determines that the institution-

exceeded all of the financial responsibility standards in this section 
that were in effect for the corresponding periods during the two-year 
period.
    (ii) In evaluating an application to approve a State tuition 
recovery fund to exempt its participating schools from the Federal cash

    (B) Allocates all refunds in accordance with the order delineated in 
Sec. 668.22(h); and
    (C) Provides a reliable mechanism for the State to replenish the 
fund should any claims arise that deplete the funds assets.
    (2) The Secretary considers an institution to be financially 
responsible, even if the institution is not otherwise financially 
responsible under paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) and (b)(6) through (9) 
of this section, if the institution--
    (i) Submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is 
acceptable and payable to the Secretary equal to not less than one-half 
of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during 
the last complete award year for which figures are available; or

ensure against its precipitous closure, including the ability to meet 
all of its financial obligations (including refunds of institutional 
charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts 
incurred in programs administered by the Secretary). The Secretary 
considers the institution to have sufficient resources to ensure against 
precipitous closure only if--
    (A) The institution formerly demonstrated financial responsibility

recent audited financial statement indicates that--
    (1) All taxes owed by the institution are current;
    (2) The institution's net income, or a change in total net assets, 
before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, has not 
decreased by more than 10 percent from the prior fiscal year, unless the 
institution demonstrates that the decreased net income shown on the 
current financial statement is a result of downsizing pursuant to a 
management-approved business plan;
    (3) Loans and other advances to related parties have not increased 
from the prior fiscal year unless such increases were secured and 
collateralized, and do not exceed 10 percent of the prior fiscal year's 
working capital of the institution;
    (4) The equity of a for-profit institution, or the total net assets 
of a non-profit institution, have not decreased by more than 10 percent 
of the prior year's total equity;
    (5) Compensation for owners or other related parties (including 
bonuses, fringe benefits, employee stock option allowances, 401k 
contributions, deferred compensation allowances) has

[[Page 429]]

not increased from the prior year at a rate higher than for all other 
employees;
    (6) The institution has not materially leveraged its assets or 
income by becoming a guarantor on any new loan or obligation on behalf

of all funds owed from related parties that are payable upon demand. For 
purposes of this section, a person does not become a related party by 
attending an institution as a student;
    (B) There have been no material findings in the institution's latest 
compliance audit of its administration of the Title IV HEA programs; and
    (C) There are no pending administrative or legal actions being taken 
against the institution by the Secretary, any other Federal agency, the 
institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency, or any State 
entity.
    (3) An institution is not required to meet the acid test ratio in 
paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) or (b)(8)(i)(B) of this section if the 
institution is an institution that provides a 2-year or 4-year 
educational program for which the institution awards an associate or 
baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that--
    (i) There is no reasonable doubt as to its continued solvency and 
ability to deliver quality educational services;
    (ii) It is current in its payment of all current liabilities, 
including student refunds, repayments to the Secretary, payroll, and 
payment of trade creditors and withholding taxes; and
    (iii) It has substantial equity in institution-occupied facilities, 
the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its failure to meet the 
acid test ratio requirement.
    (4) The Secretary may determine an institution to be financially 
responsible even if the institution is not otherwise financially 
responsible under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if--
    (i) The institution notifies the Secretary, in accordance with 34 
CFR 600.30, that the person referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section exercises substantial control over the institution; and
    (ii)(A) The person repaid to the Secretary a portion of the 
applicable liability, and the portion repaid equals or exceeds the 
greater of--
    (1) The total percentage of the ownership interest held in the 
institution or third-party servicer that owes the liability by that 
person or any member or members of that person's family, either alone or 
in combination with one another;
    (2) The total percentage of the ownership interest held in the 
institution or servicer that owes the liability that the person or any 
member or members of the person's family, either alone or in combination 
with one another, represents or represented under a voting trust, power 
of attorney, proxy, or similar agreement; or
    (3) Twenty-five percent, if the person or any member of the person's 
family is or was a member of the board of directors, chief executive 
officer, or other executive officer of the institution or servicer that 
owes the liability, or of an entity holding at least a 25 percent 
ownership interest in the institution that owes the liability;
    (B) The applicable liability described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section is currently being repaid in accordance with a written agreement 
with the Secretary; or
    (C) The institution demonstrates why--
    (1) The person who exercises substantial control over the 
institution should nevertheless be considered to lack that control; or
    (2) The person who exercises substantial control over the 
institution and each member of that person's family nevertheless does 
not or did not exercise substantial control over the institution or 
servicer that owes the liability.
    (e) [Reserved]

Sec. 668.16  Standards of administrative capability.

    To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA 
program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary that the 
institution is capable of adequately administering that program under 
each of the standards established in this section. The Secretary 
considers an institution to have that administrative capability if the 
institution--
    (a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance with all 
statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, all 
applicable regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory 
authority, and all applicable special arrangements, agreements, and 
limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to 
Title IV of the HEA;
    (b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible for 
administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it participates 
and for coordinating those programs with the institution's other Federal 
and non-Federal programs of student financial assistance. The Secretary 
considers an individual to be ``capable'' under this paragraph if the 
individual is certified by the State in which the institution is 
located, if the State requires certification of financial aid 
administrators. The Secretary may consider other factors in determining 
whether an individual is capable, including, but not limited to, the 
individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program training 
provided or approved by the Secretary, and previous experience and 
documented success in administering the Title IV, HEA programs properly;
    (2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to administer the 
Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution participates. The 
Secretary considers the following factors to determine whether an 
institution uses an adequate number of qualified persons--
    (i) The number and types of programs in which the institution 
participates;
    (ii) The number of applications evaluated;
    (iii) The number of students who receive any student financial 
assistance at the institution and the amount of funds administered;
    (iv) The financial aid delivery system used by the institution;
    (v) The degree of office automation used by the institution in the 
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs;
    (vi) The number and distribution of financial aid staff; and
    (vii) The use of third-party servicers to aid in the administration 
of the Title IV, HEA programs;
    (3) Communicates to the individual designated to be responsible for 
administering Title IV, HEA programs, all the information received by 
any institutional office that bears on a student's eligibility for Title 
IV, HEA program assistance; and
    (4) Has written procedures for or written information indicating the 
responsibilities of the various offices with respect to the approval, 
disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, HEA program assistance and the 
preparation and submission of reports to the Secretary;

[[Page 432]]

    (c)(1) Administers Title IV, HEA programs with adequate checks and 
balances in its system of internal controls; and
    (2) Divides the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or 
delivering funds so that no office has responsibility for both functions 
with respect to any particular student aided under the programs. For 
example, the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or 
delivering funds must be divided so that for any particular student 
aided under the programs, the two functions are carried out by at least 
two organizationally independent individuals who are not members of the 
same family, as defined in Sec. 668.15, or who do not together exercise 
substantial control, as defined in Sec. 668.15, over the institution;
    (d) Establishes and maintains records required under this part and 
the individual Title IV, HEA program regulations;
    (e) For purposes of determining student eligibility for assistance 
under a Title IV, HEA program, establishes, publishes, and applies 
reasonable standards for measuring whether an otherwise eligible student 
is maintaining satisfactory progress in his or her educational program. 
The Secretary considers an institution's standards to be reasonable if 
the standards--
    (1) Are the same as or stricter than the institution's standards for 
a student enrolled in the same educational program who is not receiving 
assistance under a Title IV, HEA program;
    (2) Include the following elements:
    (i) A qualitative component which consists of grades (provided that 
the standards meet or exceed the requirements of Sec. 668.34), work 
projects completed, or comparable factors that are measurable against a 
norm.
    (ii) A quantitative component that consists of a maximum timeframe 
in which a student must complete his or her educational program. The 
timeframe must--
    (A) For an undergraduate program, be no longer than 150 percent of 
the published length of the educational program measured in academic 
years, terms, credit hours attempted, clock hours completed, etc. as 
appropriate;
    (B) Be divided into increments, not to exceed the lesser of one 
academic year or one-half the published length of the educational 
program;
    (C) Include a schedule established by the institution designating 
the minimum percentage or amount of work that a student must 
successfully complete at the end of each increment to complete his or 
her educational program within the maximum timeframe; and
    (D) Include specific policies defining the effect of course 
incompletes, withdrawals, repetitions, and noncredit remedial courses on 
satisfactory progress;
    (3) Provide for consistent application of standards to all students 
within categories of students, e.g., full-time, part-time, 
undergraduate, and graduate students, and educational programs 
established by the institution;
    (4) Provide for a determination at the end of each increment by the 
institution as to whether the student has met the qualitative and 
quantitative components of the standards (as provided for in paragraphs 
(e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section);
    (5) Provide specific procedures under which a student may appeal a 
determination that the student is not making satisfactory progress; and
    (6) Provide specific procedures for a student to re-establish that 
he or she is maintaining satisfactory progress.
    (f) Develops and applies an adequate system to identify and resolve 
discrepancies in the information that the institution receives from 
different sources with respect to a student's application for financial 
aid under Title IV, HEA programs. In determining whether the 
institution's system is adequate, the Secretary considers whether the 
institution obtains and reviews--
    (1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents, 
Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration Status, 
and eligibility notification documents presented by or on behalf of each 
applicant;
    (2) Any documents, including any copies of State and Federal income 
tax returns, that are normally collected by the institution to verify 
information

[[Page 433]]

received from the student or other sources; and
    (3) Any other information normally available to the institution 
regarding a student's citizenship, previous educational experience, 
documentation of the student's social security number, or other factors 
relating to the student's eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA 
programs;
    (g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the Department of 
Education for investigation--
    (1) After conducting the review of an application provided for under 
paragraph (f) of this section, any credible information indicating that 
an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance may have engaged in 
fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her 
application. The type of information that an institution must refer is 
that which is relevant to the eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, 
HEA program assistance, or the amount of the assistance. Examples of 
this type of information are--
    (i) False claims of independent student status;
    (ii) False claims of citizenship;
    (iii) Use of false identities;
    (iv) Forgery of signatures or certifications; and
    (v) False statements of income; and
    (2) Any credible information indicating that any employee, third-
party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a 
capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs, 
or the receipt of funds under those programs, may have engaged in fraud, 
misrepresentation, conversion or breach of fiduciary responsibility, or 
other illegal conduct involving the Title IV, HEA programs. The type of 
information that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to 
the eligibility and funding of the institution and its students through 
the Title IV, HEA programs;
    (h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling to eligible students 
who apply for Title IV, HEA program assistance. In determining whether 
an institution provides adequate counseling, the Secretary considers 
whether its counseling includes information regarding--
    (1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered;
    (2) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, delivered, 
or applied to a student's account; and
    (3) The rights and responsibilities of the student with respect to 
enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial aid. This 
information includes the institution's refund policy, the requirements 
for the treatment of title IV, HEA program funds when a student 
withdraws under Sec. 668.22, its standards of satisfactory progress, and 
other conditions that may alter the student's aid package;
    (i) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and financial 
statements required for compliance with the provisions of this part and 
the individual program regulations in a timely manner;
    (j) Shows no evidence of significant problems that affect, as 
determined by the Secretary, the institution's ability to administer a 
Title IV, HEA program and that are identified in--
    (1) Reviews of the institution conducted by the Secretary, the 
Department of Education's Office of Inspector General, nationally 
recognized accrediting agencies, guaranty agencies as defined in 34 CFR 
part 682, the State agency or official by whose authority the 
institution is legally authorized to provide postsecondary education, or 
any other law enforcement agency; or
    (2) Any findings made in any criminal, civil, or administrative 
proceeding;
    (k) Is not, and does not have any principal or affiliate of the 
institution (as those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85) that is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended under Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 (3 CFR, 
1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (2) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 34 CFR 85.305 or 
85.405 for debarment or suspension under E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., 
p. 189) or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4;
    (l) For an institution that seeks initial participation in a Title 
IV, HEA program, does not have more than 33 percent of its undergraduate 
regular students withdraw from the institution

[[Page 434]]

during the institution's latest completed award year. The institution 
must count all regular students who are enrolled during the latest 
completed award year, except those students who, during that period--
    (1) Withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from the 
institution;
    (2) Were entitled to and actually received in a timely manner, a 
refund of 100 percent of their tuition and fees;
    (m)(1) Has a cohort default rate--
    (i) Calculated under subpart M of this part, that is less than 25 
percent for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which the 
Secretary has determined the institution's rate; and
    (ii) As defined in 34 CFR 674.5, on loans made under the Federal 
Perkins Loan Program to students for attendance at that institution that 
does not exceed 15 percent;
    (2)(i) However, if the Secretary determines that an institution's 
administrative capability is impaired solely because the institution 
fails to comply with paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the Secretary 
allows the institution to continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA 
programs but may provisionally certify the institution in accordance 
with Sec. 668.13(c); and
    (ii) The institution may appeal the loss of full participation in a 
Title IV, HEA program under paragraph (m)(1) of this section by 
submitting an erroneous data appeal in writing to the Secretary in 
accordance with and on the grounds specified in subpart M of this part;
    (n) Does not otherwise appear to lack the ability to administer the 
Title IV, HEA programs competently; and
    (o) Participates in the electronic processes that the Secretary--
    (1) Provides at no substantial charge to the institution; and
    (2) Identifies through a notice published in the Federal Register.

    (2) The institution may not make a disbursement to that student for 
seven days following its request, unless it receives the information 
from NSLDS in response to its request or obtains that information

Sec. 668.20  Limitations on remedial coursework that is eligible for Title IV, HEA program assistance.

    (a) A noncredit or reduced credit remedial course is a course of 
study designed to increase the ability of a student to pursue a course 
of study leading to a certificate or degree.
    (1) A noncredit remedial course is one for which no credit is given 
toward a certificate or degree; and
    (2) A reduced credit remedial course is one for which reduced credit 
is given toward a certificate or degree.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, in 
determining a student's enrollment status and cost of attendance, an 
institution shall include any noncredit or reduced credit remedial 
course in which the student is enrolled. The institution shall attribute 
the number of credit or clock hours to a noncredit or reduced credit 
remedial course by--
    (1) Calculating the number of classroom and homework hours required 
for that course;
    (2) Comparing those hours with the hours required for nonremedial 
courses in a similar subject; and
    (3) Giving the remedial course the same number of credit or clock 
hours it gives the nonremedial course with the most comparable classroom 
and homework requirements.
    (c) In determining a student's enrollment status under the Title IV, 
HEA programs or a student's cost of attendance under the campus-based, 
FFEL, and Direct Loan programs, an institution may not take into account 
any noncredit or reduced credit remedial course if--
    (1) That course is part of a program of instruction leading to a 
high school diploma or the recognized equivalent of a high school 
diploma, even if the course is necessary to enable the student to 
complete a degree or certificate program;
    (2) The educational level of instruction provided in the noncredit 
or reduced credit remedial course is below the level needed to pursue 
successfully the degree or certificate program offered by that 
institution after one year in that remedial course; or
    (3) Except for a course in English as a second language, the 
educational level of instruction provided in that course is below the 
secondary level. For purposes of this section, the Secretary considers a 
course to be below the secondary level if any of the following entities 
determine that course to be below the secondary level:
    (i) The State agency that legally authorized the institution to 
provide postsecondary education.
    (ii) In the case of an accredited or preaccredited institution, the 
nationally recognized accrediting agency or association that accredits 
or preaccredits the institution.
    (iii) In the case of a public postsecondary vocational institution 
that is approved by a State agency recognized for the approval of public 
postsecondary vocational education, the State agency recognized for the 
approval of public postsecondary vocational education that approves the 
institution.
    (iv) The institution.
    (d) Except as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, an 
institution may not take into account more than one academic year's 
worth of noncredit or reduced credit remedial coursework in determining-
-
    (1) A student's enrollment status under the title IV, HEA programs; 
and
    (2) A student's cost of attendance under the campus-based, FFEL, and 
Direct Loan programs.
    (e) One academic year's worth of noncredit or reduced credit 
remedial coursework is equivalent to--
    (1) Thirty semester or 45 quarter hours; or
    (2) Nine hundred clock hours.

    (a)(1) If a student officially withdraws, drops out, or is expelled 
before his or her first day of class of a payment period, all funds paid 
to the student for that payment period for institutional or 
noninstitutional costs under the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and Federal

    (2) The institution shall return that overpayment to the respective 
title IV, HEA programs in the amount that the student received from each 
program.

Sec. 668.22  Treatment of title IV funds when a student withdraws.

    (a) General. (1) When a recipient of title IV grant or loan 
assistance withdraws from an institution during a payment period or 
period of enrollment in which the recipient began attendance, the 
institution must determine the amount of title IV grant or loan 
assistance (not including Federal Work-Study or the non-Federal share of 
FSEOG awards if an institution meets its FSEOG matching share by the 
individual recipient method or the aggregate method) that the student 
earned as of the student's withdrawal date in accordance with paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (2) If the total amount of title IV grant or loan assistance, or 
both, that the student earned as calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section is less than the amount of title IV grant or loan 
assistance that was disbursed to the student or on behalf of the student 
in the case of a PLUS loan, as of the date of the institution's 
determination that the student withdrew--
    (i) The difference between these amounts must be returned to the 
title IV programs in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this 
section in the order specified in paragraph (i) of this section; and
    (ii) No additional disbursements may be made to the student for the 
payment period or period of enrollment.
    (3) If the total amount of title IV grant or loan assistance, or 
both, that the student earned as calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section is greater than the total amount of title IV grant or loan 
assistance, or both, that was disbursed to the student or on behalf of 
the student in the case of a PLUS loan, as of the date of the 
institution's determination that the student withdrew, the difference 
between these amounts must be treated as a post-withdrawal disbursement 
in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section and 
Sec. 668.164(g)(2).
    (4)(i)(A) If outstanding charges exist on the student's account, the 
institution may credit the student's account in accordance with 
Sec. 668.164(d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) with all or a portion of the 
post-withdrawal disbursement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, up to the amount of the outstanding charges.
    (B) If Direct Loan, FFEL, or Federal Perkins Loan Program funds are 
used to credit the student's account, the institution must notify the 
student, or parent in the case of a PLUS loan, and provide an 
opportunity for the borrower to cancel all or a portion of the loan, in 
accordance with Sec. 668.165(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5).
    (ii)(A) The institution must offer any amount of a post-withdrawal 
disbursement that is not credited to the student's account in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section to the student, or the parent 
in the case of a PLUS loan, within 30 days of the date

[[Page 437]]

of the institution's determination that the student withdrew, as defined 
in paragraph (l)(3) of this section, by providing a written notification 
to the student, or parent in the case of PLUS loan funds. The written 
notification must--
    (1) Identify the type and amount of the title IV funds that make up 
the post-withdrawal disbursement that is not credited to the student's 
account in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section;
    (2) Explain that the student or parent may accept or decline some or 
all of the post-withdrawal disbursement that is not credited to the 
student's account in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section; and
    (3) Advise the student or parent that no post-withdrawal 
disbursement will be made to the student or parent if the student or 
parent does not respond within 14 days of the date that the institution 
sent the notification, unless the institution chooses to make a post-
withdrawal disbursement in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(D) of 
this section.
    (B) If the student or parent submits a timely response that 
instructs the institution to make all or a portion of the post-
withdrawal disbursement, the institution must disburse the funds in the 
manner specified by the student or parent within 90 days of the date of 
the institution's determination that the student withdrew, as defined in 
paragraph (l)(3) of this section.
    (C) If the student or parent does not respond to the institution's 
notice, no portion of the post-withdrawal disbursement that is not 
credited to the student's account in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) 
of this section may be disbursed.
    (D) If a student or parent submits a late response to the 
institution's notice, the institution may make the post-withdrawal 
disbursement as instructed by the student or parent or decline to do so.
    (E) If a student or parent submits a late response to the 
institution and the institution does not choose to make the post-
withdrawal disbursement in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(D) of 
this section, the institution must inform the student or parent 
electronically or in writing concerning the outcome of the post-
withdrawal disbursement request.
    (iii) A post-withdrawal disbursement must be made from available 
grant funds before available loan funds.
    (b) Withdrawal date for a student who withdraws from an institution 
that is required to take attendance. (1) For purposes of this section, 
for a student who ceases attendance at an institution that is required 
to take attendance, including a student who does not return from an 
approved leave of absence, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, 
or a student who takes a leave of absence that does not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the student's withdrawal 
date is the last date of academic attendance as determined by the 
institution from its attendance records.
    (2) An institution must document a student's withdrawal date 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and 
maintain the documentation as of the date of the institution's 
determination that the student withdrew, as defined in paragraph (l)(3) 
of this section.
    (3)(i) An institution is ``required to take attendance'' if the 
institution is required to take attendance for some or all of its 
students by an entity outside of the institution (such as the 
institution's accrediting agency or state agency).
    (ii) If an outside entity requires an institution to take attendance 
for only some students, the institution must use its attendance records 
to determine a withdrawal date in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section for those students.
    (c) Withdrawal date for a student who withdraws from an institution 
that is not required to take attendance. (1) For purposes of this 
section, for a student who ceases attendance at an institution that is 
not required to take attendance, the student's withdrawal date is--
    (i) The date, as determined by the institution, that the student 
began the withdrawal process prescribed by the institution;
    (ii) The date, as determined by the institution, that the student 
otherwise

[[Page 438]]

provided official notification to the institution, in writing or orally, 
of his or her intent to withdraw;
    (iii) If the student ceases attendance without providing official 
notification to the institution of his or her withdrawal in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the mid-point of 
the payment period (or period of enrollment, if applicable);
    (iv) If the institution determines that a student did not begin the 
institution's withdrawal process or otherwise provide official 
notification (including notice from an individual acting on the 
student's behalf) to the institution of his or her intent to withdraw 
because of illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such 
circumstances beyond the student's control, the date that the 
institution determines is related to that circumstance;
    (v) If a student does not return from an approved leave of absence 
as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, the date that the 
institution determines the student began the leave of absence; or
    (vi) If a student takes a leave of absence that does not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the date that the student 
began the leave of absence.
    (2)(i)(A) An institution may allow a student to rescind his or her 
official notification to withdraw under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of 
this section by filing a written statement that he or she is continuing 
to participate in academically-related activities and intends to 
complete the payment period or period of enrollment.
    (B) If the student subsequently ceases to attend the institution 
prior to the end of the payment period or period of enrollment, the 
student's rescission is negated and the withdrawal date is the student's 
original date under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, unless 
a later date is determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (ii) If a student both begins the withdrawal process prescribed by 
the institution and otherwise provides official notification of his or 
her intent to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section respectively, the student's withdrawal date 
is the earlier date unless a later date is determined under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, an 
institution that is not required to take attendance may use as the 
student's withdrawal date a student's last date of attendance at an 
academically-related activity provided that the institution documents 
that the activity is academically related and documents the student's 
attendance at the activity.
    (ii) An ``academically-related activity'' includes, but is not 
limited to, an exam, a tutorial, computer-assisted instruction, academic 
counseling, academic advisement, turning in a class assignment or 
attending a study group that is assigned by the institution.
    (4) An institution must document a student's withdrawal date 
determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this 
section and maintain the documentation as of the date of the 
institution's determination that the student withdrew, as defined in 
paragraph (l)(3) of this section.
    (5)(i) ``Official notification to the institution'' is a notice of 
intent to withdraw that a student provides to an office designated by 
the institution.
    (ii) An institution must designate one or more offices at the 
institution that a student may readily contact to provide official 
notification of withdrawal.
    (d) Approved leave of absence. (1) For purposes of this section 
(and, for a title IV, HEA program loan borrower, for purposes of 
terminating the student's in-school status), an institution does not 
have to treat a leave of absence as a withdrawal if it is an approved 
leave of absence. A leave of absence is an approved leave of absence if-
-
    (i) The institution has a formal policy regarding leaves of absence;
    (ii) The student followed the institution's policy in requesting the 
leave of absence;
    (iii) The institution determines that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the student will return to the school;
    (iv) The institution approved the student's request in accordance 
with the institution's policy;

[[Page 439]]

    (v) The leave of absence does not involve additional charges by the 
institution;
    (vi) It is the only leave of absence granted to the student in a 12-
month period, except as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section;
    (vii) The leave of absence does not exceed 180 days in any 12-month 
period;
    (viii) Upon the student's return from the leave of absence, the 
student is permitted to complete the coursework he or she began prior to 
the leave of absence; and
    (ix) If the student is a title IV, HEA program loan recipient, the 
institution explains to the student, prior to granting the leave of 
absence, the effects that the student's failure to return from a leave 
of absence may have on the student's loan repayment terms, including the 
exhaustion of some or all of the student's grace period.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section, provided 
that the total number of days of all leaves of absence does not exceed 
180 days in any 12-month period, an institution may treat--
    (i) One leave of absence subsequent to a leave of absence that is 
granted in accordance with (d)(1)(vi) of this section as an approved 
leave of absence if the subsequent leave of absence does not exceed 30 
days and the institution determines that the subsequent leave of absence 
is necessary due to unforeseen circumstances; and
    (ii) Subsequent leaves of absence as approved leaves of absence if 
the institution documents that the leaves of absence are granted for 
jury duty, military reasons, or circumstances covered under the Family 
and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
    (3) If a student does not resume attendance at the institution on or 
before the end of a leave of absence that meets the requirements of this 
section, the institution must treat the student as a withdrawal in 
accordance with the requirements of this section.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph--
    (i) The number of days in a leave of absence are counted beginning 
with the first day of the student's initial leave of absence in a 12-
month period.
    (ii) A ``12-month period'' begins on the first day of the student's 
initial leave of absence.
    (iii) An institution's leave of absence policy is a ``formal 
policy'' if the policy--
    (A) Is in writing and publicized to students; and
    (B) Requires students to provide a written, signed, and dated 
request for a leave of absence prior to the leave of absence. However, 
if unforeseen circumstances prevent a student from providing a prior 
written request, the institution may grant the student's request for a 
leave of absence, if the institution documents its decision and collects 
the written request at a later date.
    (e) Calculation of the amount of title IV assistance earned by the 
student. (1) General. The amount of title IV grant or loan assistance 
that is earned by the student is calculated by--
    (i) Determining the percentage of title IV grant or loan assistance 
that has been earned by the student, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Applying this percentage to the total amount of title IV grant 
or loan assistance that was disbursed (and that could have been 
disbursed, as defined in paragraph (l)(1) of this section) to the 
student, or on the student's behalf, for the payment period or period of 
enrollment as of the student's withdrawal date.
    (2) Percentage earned. The percentage of title IV grant or loan 
assistance that has been earned by the student is--
    (i) Equal to the percentage of the payment period or period of 
enrollment that the student completed (as determined in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section) as of the student's withdrawal date, if 
this date occurs on or before completion of 60 percent of the--
    (A) Payment period or period of enrollment for a program that is 
measured in credit hours; or
    (B) Clock hours scheduled to be completed for the payment period or 
period of enrollment for a program that is measured in clock hours; or
    (ii) 100 percent, if the student's withdrawal date occurs after 
completion of 60 percent of the--

[[Page 440]]

    (A) Payment period or period of enrollment for a program that is 
measured in credit hours; or
    (B) Clock hours scheduled to be completed for the payment period or 
period of enrollment for a program measured in clock hours.
    (3) Percentage unearned. The percentage of title IV grant or loan 
assistance that has not been earned by the student is calculated by 
determining the complement of the percentage of title IV grant or loan 
assistance earned by the student as described in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section.
    (4) Total amount of unearned title IV assistance to be returned. The 
unearned amount of title IV assistance to be returned is calculated by 
subtracting the amount of title IV assistance earned by the student as 
calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section from the amount of 
title IV aid that was disbursed to the student as of the date of the 
institution's determination that the student withdrew.
    (5) Use of payment period or period of enrollment. (i) The treatment 
of title IV grant or loan funds if a student withdraws must be 
determined on a payment period basis for a student who attended a 
standard term-based (semester, trimester, or quarter) educational 
program.
    (ii)(A) The treatment of title IV grant or loan funds if a student 
withdraws may be determined on either a payment period basis or a period 
of enrollment basis for a student who attended a non-term based 
educational program or a nonstandard term-based educational program.
    (B) An institution must consistently use either a payment period or 
period of enrollment for all purposes of this section for each of the 
following categories of students who withdraw from the same non-term 
based or nonstandard term-based educational program:
    (1) Students who have attended an educational program at the 
institution from the beginning of the payment period or period of 
enrollment.
    (2) Students who re-enter the institution during a payment period or 
period of enrollment.
    (3) Students who transfer into the institution during a payment 
period or period of enrollment.
    (f) Percentage of payment period or period of enrollment completed. 
(1) For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the percentage 
of the payment period or period of enrollment completed is determined--
    (i) In the case of a program that is measured in credit hours, by 
dividing the total number of calendar days in the payment period or 
period of enrollment into the number of calendar days completed in that 
period as of the student's withdrawal date; and
    (ii) In the case of a program that is measured in clock hours, by 
dividing the total number of clock hours in the payment period or period 
of enrollment into the number of clock hours--
    (A) Completed by the student in that period as of the student's 
withdrawal date; or
    (B) Scheduled to be completed as of the student's withdrawal date, 
if the clock hours completed in the period are not less than 70 percent 
of the hours that were scheduled to be completed by the student as of 
the student's withdrawal date.
    (2)(i) The total number of calendar days in a payment period or 
period of enrollment includes all days within the period, except that 
scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days are excluded from the 
total number of calendar days in a payment period or period of 
enrollment and the number of calendar days completed in that period.
    (ii) The total number of calendar days in a payment period or period 
of enrollment does not include days in which the student was on an 
approved leave of absence.
    (g) Return of unearned aid, responsibility of the institution. (1) 
The institution must return, in the order specified in paragraph (i) of 
this section, the lesser of--
    (i) The total amount of unearned title IV assistance to be returned 
as calculated under paragraph (e)(4) of this section; or
    (ii) An amount equal to the total institutional charges incurred by 
the student for the payment period or period

[[Page 441]]

of enrollment multiplied by the percentage of title IV grant or loan 
assistance that has not been earned by the student, as described in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this section, ``institutional charges'' are 
tuition, fees, room and board (if the student contracts with the 
institution for the room and board) and other educationally-related 
expenses assessed by the institution.
    (3) If, for a non-term program an institution chooses to calculate 
the treatment of title IV assistance on a payment period basis, but the 
institution charges for a period that is longer than the payment period, 
``total institutional charges incurred by the student for the payment 
period'' is the greater of--
    (i) The prorated amount of institutional charges for the longer 
period; or
    (ii) The amount of title IV assistance retained for institutional 
charges as of the student's withdrawal date.
    (h) Return of unearned aid, responsibility of the student. (1) After 
the institution has allocated the unearned funds for which it is 
responsible in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, the 
student must return assistance for which the student is responsible in 
the order specified in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (2) The amount of assistance that the student is responsible for 
returning is calculated by subtracting the amount of unearned aid that 
the institution is required to return under paragraph (g) of this 
section from the total amount of unearned title IV assistance to be 
returned under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (3) The student (or parent in the case of funds due to a PLUS Loan) 
must return or repay, as appropriate, the amount determined under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section to--
    (i) Any title IV loan program in accordance with the terms of the 
loan; and
    (ii) Any title IV grant program as an overpayment of the grant; 
however, a student is not required to return 50 percent of the grant 
assistance that is the responsibility of the student to repay under this 
section.
    (4)(i) A student who owes an overpayment under this section remains 
eligible for title IV, HEA program funds through and beyond the earlier 
of 45 days from the date the institution sends a notification to the 
student of the overpayment, or 45 days from the date the institution was 
required to notify the student of the overpayment if, during those 45 
days the student--
    (A) Repays the overpayment in full to the institution;
    (B) Enters into a repayment agreement with the institution in 
accordance with repayment arrangements satisfactory to the institution; 
or
    (C) Signs a repayment agreement with the Secretary, which will 
include terms that permit a student to repay the overpayment while 
maintaining his or her eligibility for title IV, HEA program funds.
    (ii) Within 30 days of the date of the institution's determination 
that the student withdrew, an institution must send a notice to any 
student who owes a title IV, HEA grant overpayment as a result of the 
student's withdrawal from the institution in order to recover the 
overpayment in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iii) If an institution chooses to enter into a repayment agreement 
in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section with a student 
who owes an overpayment of title IV, HEA grant funds, it must--
    (A) Provide the student with terms that permit the student to repay 
the overpayment while maintaining his or her eligibility for title IV, 
HEA program funds; and
    (B) Require repayment of the full amount of the overpayment within 
two years of the date of the institution's determination that the 
student withdrew.
    (iv) An institution must refer to the Secretary, in accordance with 
procedures required by the Secretary, an overpayment of title IV, HEA 
grant funds owed by a student as a result of the student's withdrawal 
from the institution if--
    (A) The student does not repay the overpayment in full to the 
institution, or enter a repayment agreement with the institution or the 
Secretary in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i) of

[[Page 442]]

this section within the earlier of 45 days from the date the institution 
sends a notification to the student of the overpayment, or 45 days from 
the date the institution was required to notify the student of the 
overpayment;
    (B) At any time the student fails to meet the terms of the repayment 
agreement with the institution entered into in accordance with paragraph 
(h)(4)(i)(B) of this section; or
    (C) The student chooses to enter into a repayment agreement with the 
Secretary.
    (v) A student who owes an overpayment is ineligible for title IV, 
HEA program funds--

repayment agreement with the institution or the Secretary entered into 
in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.
    (vi) A student who is ineligible under paragaraph (h)(4)(v) of this 
section regains eligibility if the student and the Secretary enter into 
a repayment agreement.
    (i) Order of return of title IV funds. (1) Loans. Unearned funds 
returned by the institution or the student, as appropriate, in 
accordance with paragraph (g) or (h) of this section respectively, must 
be credited to outstanding balances on title IV loans made to the 
student or on behalf of the student for the payment period or period of 
enrollment for which a return of funds is required. Those funds must be

conducted in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other 
Nonprofit Organizations''; Office of Management and Budget Circular A-
128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments'', or the audit guides

Federal student aid functions performed by that entity are covered in 
the submission. (Both OMB circulars are available by calling OMB's 
Publication Office at (202) 395-7332, or they can be obtained in 
electronic form on the OMB Home Page (http://www.whitehouse.gov).
    (b) Compliance audits for institutions. (1) An institution's 
compliance audit must cover, on a fiscal year basis, all title IV, HEA 
program transactions, and must cover all of those transactions that have 
occurred since the period covered by the institution's last compliance 
audit.
    (2) The compliance audit required under this section must be 
conducted in accordance with--
    (i) The general standards and the standards for compliance audits 
contained in the U.S. General Accounting Office's (GAO's) Government

    (ii) Procedures for audits contained in audit guides developed by, 
and available from, the Department of Education's Office of Inspector 
General.
    (3) The Secretary may require an institution to provide a copy of 
its compliance audit report to guaranty agencies or eligible lenders 
under the FFEL programs, State agencies, the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs, or nationally recognized accrediting agencies.
    (c) Compliance audits for third-party servicers. (1) A third-party 
servicer that administers title IV, HEA programs for institutions does 
not have to have a compliance audit performed if--
    (i) The servicer contracts with only one institution; and
    (ii) The audit of that institution's administration of the title IV, 
HEA programs involves every aspect of the servicer's administration of 
that program for that institution.
    (2) A third-party servicer that contracts with more than one 
participating institution may submit a compliance audit report that 
covers the servicer's administration of the title IV, HEA programs for 
all institutions with which the servicer contracts.
    (3) A third-party servicer must submit annually to the Secretary its 
compliance audit no later than six months after the last day of the 
servicer's fiscal year.
    (4) The Secretary may require a third-party servicer to provide a 
copy of its compliance audit report to guaranty agencies or eligible 
lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs, or nationally recognized accrediting agencies.
    (d) Audited financial statements. (1) General. To enable the 
Secretary to make a determination of financial responsibility, an 
institution must, to the extent requested by the Secretary, submit to 
the Secretary a set of financial statements for its latest complete 
fiscal year, as well as any other documentation the Secretary deems 
necessary to make that determination. Financial statements submitted to 
the Secretary must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and audited by an independent 
auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing 
standards, and other guidance contained in the Office of Management and 
Budget Circular A-133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and 
Other Nonprofit Organizations''; Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments''; or in audit 
guides developed by, and available from, the Department of Education's 
Office of Inspector General , whichever is applicable. As part of these 
financial statements, the institution must include a detailed 
description of related entities based on the definition of a related 
entity as set forth in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
(SFAS) 57. The disclosure requirements under this provision extend 
beyond those of SFAS 57 to include all related parties and a level of 
detail that would enable to Secretary to readily identify the related 
party. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the name, 
location and a description of the related entity including the nature 
and amount of any transactions between the related party and the 
institution, financial or otherwise, regardless of when they occurred.
    (2) Submission of additional financial statements. To the extent 
requested by the Secretary in determining whether an institution is 
financially responsible, the Secretary may also require the submission 
of audited consolidated financial statements, audited full consolidating 
financial statements, audited combined financial statements or the 
audited financial statements of one or more related parties that have 
the ability, either individually or collectively, to significantly

    (3) Audited financial statements for foreign institutions. A foreign 
institution must submit--
    (i) Audited financial statements prepared in accordance with the 
generally accepted accounting principles of the institution's home 
country, if the institution received less than $500,000 U.S. in title 
IV, HEA program funds during its most recently completed fiscal year; or
    (ii) Audited financial statements translated to meet the 
requirements of

[[Page 445]]

paragraph (d) of this section, if the institution received $500,000 U.S. 
or more in title IV, HEA program funds during its most recently 
completed fiscal year.
    (4) Disclosure of title IV HEA program revenue. A proprietary 
institution must disclose in a footnote to its financial statement audit 
the percentage of its revenues derived from the title IV, HEA program 
funds that the institution received during the fiscal year covered by 
that audit. The revenue percentage must be calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 600.5(d).
    (5) Audited financial statements for third-party servicers. A third-
party servicer that enters into a contract with a lender or guaranty 
agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or guaranty agency's 
programs, as provided under 34 CFR part 682, must submit annually an 
audited financial statement. This financial statement must be prepared 
on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with 
generally accepted government auditing standards and other guidance 
contained in audit guides issued by the Department of Education's Office 
of Inspector General.
    (e) Access to records. (1) An institution or a third-party servicer 
that has a compliance or financial statement audit conducted under this 
section must--
    (i) Give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records 
or other documents necessary to review that audit, including the right 
to obtain copies of those records or documents; and
    (ii) Require an individual or firm conducting the audit to give the 
Secretary and the Inspector General access to records, audit work 
papers, or other documents necessary to review that audit, including the 
right to obtain copies of those records, work papers, or documents.
    (2) An institution must give the Secretary and the Inspector General 
access to records or other documents necessary to review a third-party 
servicer's compliance or financial statement audit, including the right 
to obtain copies of those records or documents.
    (f) Determination of liabilities. (1) Based on the audit finding and 
the institution's or third-party servicer's response, the Secretary 
determines the amount of liability, if any, owed by the institution or 
servicer and instructs the institution or servicer as to the manner of 
repayment.
    (2) If the Secretary determines that a third-party servicer owes a 
liability for its administration of an institution's title IV, HEA 
programs, the servicer must notify each institution under whose contract 
the servicer owes a liability of that determination. The servicer must 
also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the 
same service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed.
    (g) Repayments. (1) An institution or third-party servicer that must 
repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay those funds 
at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the 
Secretary's notification, unless--
    (i) The institution or servicer files an appeal under the procedures 
established in subpart H of this part; or
    (ii) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g)(1) of this section--
    (i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted surety or 
has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary questions 
expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements and identifies 
liabilities, then the Secretary may determine that deferring recourse to 
the surety or guarantee is not appropriate because--
    (A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers affected by 
the act or omission giving rise to the liability outweighs the 
importance of deferring collection action until completion of available 
appeal proceedings; or
    (B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete 
assurance that recourse to that protection will be fully available 
through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or
    (ii) The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR 
part

[[Page 446]]

30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures of this section.
    (3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in 
the Secretary's notification, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to 
the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or 
third-party servicer must repay those funds at the direction of the 
Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this 
part unless--
    (i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or
    (ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is 
appropriate pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (4) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the 
institution's third-party servicer for a violation incurred in servicing 
any aspect of that institution's participation in the title IV, HEA 
programs and remains responsible for that amount until that amount is 
repaid in full.

If the auditor is not sufficiently independent to produce unbiased 
opinions, conclusions, and judgments, he should state in a prominent 
place in the audit report his relationship with the organization or 
officials being audited.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1 \ If the auditor is not fully independent because he or she is an 
employee of the audited entity, it will be adequate disclosure to so 
indicate. If the auditor is a practicing certified public accountant, 
his or her conduct should be governed by the AICPA ``Statements on 
Auditing Procedure.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The auditor should consider not only whether his or her own 
attitude and beliefs permit him or her to be independent but also 
whether there is anything about his or her situation which would lead 
others to question his or her independence. Both situations deserve 
consideration since it is important not only that the auditor be, in 
fact, independent and impartial but also that other persons will 
consider him or her so.
    (d) There are three general classes of impairments that the auditor 
needs to consider; these are personal, external, and organizational 
impairments. If one or more of these are of such significance as to 
affect the auditor's ability to perform his or her work and report its 
results impartially, he or she should decline to perform the audit or 
indicate in the report that he or she was not fully independent.

[[Page 454]]

                          Personal Impairments

    There are some circumstances in which an auditor cannot be impartial 
because of his or her views or his or her personal situation. These 
circumstances might include:
    1. Relationships of an official, professional, and/or personal 
nature that might cause the auditor to limit the extent or character of 
the inquiry, to limit disclosure, or to weaken his or her findings in 
any way.
    2. Preconceived ideas about the objectives or quality of a 
particular operation or personal likes or dislikes of individuals, 
groups, or objectives of a particular program.
    3. Previous involvement in a decisionmaking or management capacity 
in the operations of the governmental entity or program being audited.
    4. Biases and prejudices, including those induced by political or 
social convictions, which result from employment in or loyalty to a 
particular group, entity, or level of government.
    5. Actual or potential restrictive influence when the auditor 
performs preaudit work and subsequently performs a post audit.
    6. Financial interest, direct or indirect, in an organization or 
facility which is benefiting from the audited programs.

                          External Impairments

    External factors can restrict the audit or impinge on the auditor's 
ability to form independent and objective opinions and conclusions. For 
example, under the following conditions either the audit itself could be 
adversely affected or the auditor would not have complete freedom to 
make an independent judgment.<SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2 \ Some of these situations may constitute justifiable limitations 
on the scope of the work. In such cases the limitation should be 
identified in the auditor's report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Interference or other influence that improperly or imprudently 
eliminates, restricts, or modifies the scope or character of the audit.
    2. Interference with the selection or application of audit 
procedures of the selection of activities to be examined.
    3. Denial of access to such sources of information as books, 
records, and supporting documents or denial or opportunity to obtain 
explanations by officials and employees of the governmental 
organization, program, or activity under audit.
    4. Interference in the assignment of personnel to the audit task.
    5. Retaliatory restrictions placed on funds or other resources 
dedicated to the audit operation.
    6. Activity to overrule or significantly influence the auditors 
judgment as to the appropriate content of the audit report.
    7. Influences that place the auditor's continued employment in 
jeopardy for reasons other than competency or the need for audit 
services.
    8. Unreasonable restriction on the time allowed to competently 
complete an audit assignment.

                       Organizational Impairments

    (a) The auditor's independence can be affected by his or her place 
within the organizational structure of governments. Auditors employed by 
Federal, State, or local government units may be subject to policy 
direction from superiors who are involved either directly or indirectly 
in the government management process. To achieve maximum independence 
such auditors and the audit organization itself not only should report 
to the highest practicable echelon within their government but should be 
organizationally located outside the line-management function of the 
entity under audit.
    (b) These auditors should also be sufficiently removed from 
political pressures to ensure that they can conduct their auditing 
objectively and can report their conclusions completely without fear of 
censure. Whenever feasible they should be under a system which will 
place decisions on compensation, training, job tenure, and advancement 
on a merit basis.
    (c) When independent public accountants or other independent 
professionals are engaged to perform work that includes inquiries into 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, efficiency and economy 
of operations, or achievement of program results, they should be engaged 
by someone other than the officials responsible for the direction of the 
effort being audited. This practice removes the pressure that may result 
if the auditor must criticize the performance of those by whom he or she 
was engaged. To remove this obstacle to independence, governments should 
arrange to have auditors engaged by officials not directly involved in 
operations to be audited.

Appendix B to Subpart B of Part 668--Appendix I, Standards for Audit of 
  Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions (GAO)

     Qualifications of Independent Auditors Engaged by Governmental 
                              Organizations

    (a) When outside auditors are engaged for assignments requiring the 
expression of an opinion on financial reports of governmental 
organizations, only fully qualified public accountants should be 
employed. The type of qualifications, as stated by the Comptroller

[[Page 455]]

General, deemed necessary for financial audits of governmental 
organizations and programs is quoted below:
    ``Such audits shall be conducted * * * by independent certified 
public accountants or by independent licensed public accountants, 
licensed on or before December 31, 1970, who are certified or licensed 
by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of 
the United States: Except that independent public accountants licensed 
to practice by such regulatory authority after December 31, 1970, and 
persons who although not so certified or licensed, meet, in the opinion 
of the Secretary, standards of education and experience representative 
of the highest prescribed by the licensing authorities of the several 
States which provide for the continuing licensing of public accountants 
and which are prescribed by the Secretary in appropriate regulations may 
perform such audits until December 31, 1975; Provided, That if the 
Secretary deems it necessary in the public interest, he may prescribe by 
regulations higher standard than those required for the practice of 
public accountancy by the regulatory authorities of the States.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Letter (B-148144, September 15, 1970) from the Comptroller 
General to the heads of Federal departments and agencies. The reference 
to ``Secretary'' means the head of the department or agency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The standards for examination and evaluation require 
consideration of applicable laws and regulations in the auditor's 
examination. The standards for reporting require a statement in the 
auditor's report regarding any significant instances of noncompliance 
disclosed by his or her examination and evaluation work. What is to be 
included in this statement requires judgment. Significant instances of 
noncompliance, even those not resulting in legal liability to the 
audited entity, should be included. Minor procedural noncompliance need 
not be disclosed.
    (c) Although the reporting standard is generally on an exception 
basis--that only noncompliance need be reported--it should be recognized 
that governmental entities often want positive statements regarding 
whether or not the auditor's tests disclosed instances of noncompliance. 
This is particularly true in grant programs where authorizing agencies 
frequently want assurance in the auditor's report that this matter has 
been considered. For such audits, auditors should obtain an 
understanding with the authorizing agency as to the extent to which such 
positive comments on compliance are desired. When coordinated audits are 
involved, the audit program should specify the extent of comments that 
the auditor is to make regarding compliance.
    (d) When noncompliance is reported, the auditor should place the 
findings in proper perspective. The extent of instances of noncompliance 
should be related to the number of cases examined to provide the reader 
with a basis for judging the prevalence of noncompliance.

institution's requirements for graduation.
    (c) An institution may find that a student is making satisfactory 
progress even though the student does not satisfy the requirements in 
paragraph (b) of this section, if the institution determines that the 
student's failure to meet those requirements is based upon--
    (1) The death of a relative of the student;
    (2) An injury or illness of the student; or
    (3) Other special circumstances.
    (d) If a student is not making satisfactory progress at the end of 
the second year, but at the end of a subsequent grading period comes

    (2) Makes arrangements, satisfactory to the holder of the loan, to 
repay that excess loan amount.

Sec. 668.36  Social security number.

    (a)(1) Except for residents of the Federated States of Micronesia, 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, the 
Secretary attempts to confirm the social security number a student 
provides on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) under a 
data match with the Social Security Administration. If the Social 
Security Administration confirms that number, the Secretary notifies the 
institution and the student of that confirmation.
    (2) If the student's verified social security number is the same 
number as the one he or she provided on the FAFSA, and the institution 
has no reason to believe that the verified social security number is 
inaccurate, the institution may consider the number to be accurate.
    (3) If the Social Security Administration does not verify the 
student's social security number on the FAFSA, or the institution has 
reason to believe that the verified social security number is 
inaccurate, the student can provide evidence to the institution, such as 
the student's social security card, indicating the accuracy of the 
student's social security number. An institution must give a student at 
least 30 days, or until the end of the award year, whichever is later, 
to produce that evidence.
    (4) An institution may not deny, reduce, delay, or terminate a 
student's eligibility for assistance under the title IV, HEA programs 
because verification of that student's social security number is 
pending.
    (b)(1) An institution may not disburse any title IV, HEA program 
funds to a student until the institution is

[[Page 459]]

satisfied that the student's reported social security number is 
accurate.
    (2) The institution shall ensure that the Secretary is notified of 
the student's accurate social security number if the student 
demonstrates the accuracy of a social security number that is not the 
number the student included on the FAFSA.
    (c) If the Secretary determines that the social security number 
provided to an institution by a student is incorrect, and that student 
has not provided evidence under paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
indicating the accuracy of the social security number, and a loan has 
been guaranteed for the student under the FFEL program, the institution 
shall notify and instruct the lender and guaranty agency making and 
guaranteeing the loan, respectively, to cease further disbursements of 
the loan, until the Secretary or the institution determines that the 
social security number provided by the student is correct, but the 
guaranty may not be voided or otherwise nullified before the date that 
the lender and the guaranty agency receive the notice.
    (d) Nothing in this section permits the Secretary to take any 
compliance, disallowance, penalty or other regulatory action against--
    (1) Any institution of higher education with respect to any error in 
a social security number, unless the error was the result of fraud on 
the part of the institution; or
    (2) Any student with respect to any error in a social security 
number, unless the error was the result of fraud on the part of the 
student.

<R05>
Sec. 668.37  Selective Service registration.

    (a)(1) To be eligible to receive title IV, HEA program funds, a male 
student who is subject to registration with the Selective Service must 
register with the Selective Service.
    (2) A male student does not have to register with the Selective 
Service if the student--
    (i) Is below the age of 18, or was born before January 1, 1960;
    (ii) Is enrolled in an officer procurement program the curriculum of 
which has been approved by the Secretary of Defense at the following 
institutions:
    (A) The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina;
    (B) North Georgia College, Dahlonega, Georgia;
    (C) Norwich University, Northfield, Vermont; or
    (D) Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, Virginia; or
    (iii) Is a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service or a 
member of the Reserve of the Public Health Service who is on active duty 
as provided in section 6(a)(2) of the Military Selective Service Act.
    (b)(1) When the Secretary processes a male student's FAFSA, the 
Secretary determines whether the student is registered with the 
Selective Service under a data match with the Selective Service.
    (2) Under the data match, Selective Service reports to the Secretary 
whether its records indicate that the student is registered, and the 
Secretary reports the results of the data match to the student and the 
institution the student is attending.
    (c)(1) If the Selective Service does not confirm through the data 
match, that the student is registered, the student can establish that 
he--
    (i) Is registered;
    (ii) Is not, or was not required to be, registered;
    (iii) Has registered since the submission of the FAFSA; or
    (iv) Meets the conditions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) An institution must give a student at least 30 days, or until 
the end of the award year, whichever is later, to provide evidence to 
establish the condition described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) An institution may determine that a student, who was required 
to, but did not register with the Selective Service, is not ineligible 
to receive title IV, HEA assistance for that reason, if the student can 
demonstrate by submitting clear and unambiguous evidence to the 
institution that--
    (1) He was unable to present himself for registration for reasons 
beyond his control such as hospitalization, incarceration, or 
institutionalization; or
    (2) He is over 26 and when he was between 18 and 26 and required to 
register--

[[Page 460]]

    (i) He did not knowingly and willfully fail to register with the 
Selective Service; or
    (ii) He served as a member of one of the U.S. Armed Forces on active 
duty and received a DD Form 214, ``Certificate of Release or Discharge 
from Active Duty,'' showing military service with other than the reserve 
forces and National Guard.
    (e) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, an 
institution may consider that a student did not knowingly and willfully 
fail to register with the Selective Service only if--
    (1) The student submits to the institution an advisory opinion from 
the Selective Service System that does not dispute the student's claim 
that he did not knowingly and willfully fail to register; and
    (2) The institution does not have uncontroverted evidence that the 
student knowingly and willfully failed to register.
    (f)(1) A student who is required to register with the Selective 
Service and has been denied title IV, HEA program assistance because he 
has not proven to the institution that he has registered with Selective 
Service may seek a hearing from the Secretary by filing a request in 
writing with the Secretary. The student must submit with that request--
    (i) A statement that he is in compliance with registration 
requirements;
    (ii) A concise statement of the reasons why he has not been able to 
prove that he is in compliance with those requirements; and
    (iii) Copies of all material that he has already supplied to the 
institution to verify his compliance.
    (2) The Secretary provides an opportunity for a hearing to a student 
who--
    (i) Asserts that he is in compliance with registration requirements; 
and
    (ii) Files a written request for a hearing in accordance with

Sec. 668.41  Reporting and disclosure of information.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Athletically related student aid means any scholarship, grant, or 
other form of financial assistance, offered by an institution, the terms 
of which require the recipient to participate in a program of 
intercollegiate athletics at the institution. Other student aid, of 
which a student-athlete simply happens to be the recipient, is not 
athletically related student aid.
    Certificate or degree-seeking student means a student enrolled in a 
course of credit who is recognized by the institution as seeking a 
degree or certificate.
    First-time undergraduate student means an entering undergraduate who 
has never attended any institution of higher education. It includes a 
student enrolled in the fall term who attended a postsecondary 
institution for the first time in the prior summer term, and a student 
who entered with advanced standing (college credit earned before 
graduation from high school).
    Normal time is the amount of time necessary for a student to 
complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the 
institution's catalog. This is typically four years for a bachelor's 
degree in a standard term-based institution, two years for an associate 
degree in a standard term-based institution, and the various scheduled 
times for certificate programs.
    Notice means a notification of the availability of information an 
institution is required by this subpart to disclose, provided to an 
individual on a one-to-one basis through an appropriate mailing or 
publication, including direct mailing through the U.S. Postal Service, 
campus mail, or electronic mail. Posting on an Internet website or an 
Intranet website does not constitute a notice.
    Official fall reporting date means that date (in the fall) on which 
an institution must report fall enrollment data to either the State, its 
board of trustees or governing board, or some other external governing 
body.
    Prospective employee means an individual who has contacted an 
eligible institution for the purpose of requesting information 
concerning employment with that institution.
    Prospective student means an individual who has contacted an 
eligible institution requesting information concerning admission to that 
institution.
    Undergraduate students, for purposes of Secs. 668.45 and 668.48 
only, means students enrolled in a bachelor's degree program, an 
associate degree program, or a vocational or technical program below the 
baccalaureate.

itself that the student will be attending the same school as the 
applicant.

Sec. 668.59  Consequences of a change in application information.

    (a) For the Federal Pell Grant Program--
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the 
information on an application changes as a result of the verification 
process, the institution shall require the applicant to resubmit his or 
her application information to the Secretary for corrections if--
    (i) The institution recalculates the applicant's EFC, determines 
that the applicant's EFC changes, and determines that the change in the 
EFC changes the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award; or
    (ii) The institution does not recalculate the applicant's EFC.
    (2) An institution need not require an applicant to resubmit his or 
her application information to the Secretary, recalculate an applicant's 
EFC, or adjust an applicant's Federal Pell Grant award if, as a result 
of the verification process, the institution finds--
    (i) No errors in nondollar items used to calculate the applicant's 
EFC;
    (ii) No dollar amount in excess of $400 as calculated by the net 
difference between the corrected sum of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus 
untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid and the uncorrected sum of Adjusted 
Gross Income (AGI) plus untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid. If no 
Federal Income Tax Return was filed, income earned from work may be used 
in lieu of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).
    (b) For the Federal Pell Grant Program--
    (1) If an institution does not recalculate an applicant's EFC under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the institution 
shall calculate and disburse the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on 
the basis of the applicant's original EFC.
    (2)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, if an institution recalculates an applicant's EFC because of a 
change in application information resulting from the verification 
process, the institution shall--
    (A) Require the applicant to resubmit his or her application to the 
Secretary;
    (B) Recalculate the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on the 
basis of the EFC on the corrected SAR or ISIR; and
    (C) Disburse any additional funds under that award only if the 
applicant provides the institution with the corrected SAR or ISIR and 
only to the extent that additional funds are payable based on the 
recalculation.
    (ii) If an institution recalculates an applicant's EFC because of a 
change in application information resulting from the verification 
process and determines that the change in the EFC increases the 
applicant's award, the institution--
    (A) May disburse the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on the 
basis of the original EFC without requiring the

[[Page 484]]

applicant to resubmit his or her application information to the 
Secretary; and
    (B) Except as provided in Sec. 668.60(b), shall disburse any 
additional funds under the increased award reflecting the new EFC if the 
institution receives the corrected SAR or ISIR.
    (c) For the campus-based, and Federal Stafford Loan or Federal 
Direct Stafford/Ford Direct Loan programs--
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the 
information on an application changes as a result of the verification 
process, the institution shall--
    (i) Recalculate the applicant's EFC; and
    (ii) Adjust the applicant's financial aid package for the campus-
based, and Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Direct 
Loan programs to reflect the new EFC if the new EFC results in an 
overaward of campus-based funds or decreases the applicant's recommended 
loan amount.
    (2) An institution need not recalculate an applicant's EFC or adjust 
his or her aid package if, as a result of the verification process, the 
institution finds--
    (i) No errors in nondollar items used to calculate the applicant's 
EFC;
    (ii) No dollar amount in excess of $400 as calculated by the net 
difference between the corrected sum of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus 
untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid and the uncorrected sum of Adjusted 
Gross Income (AGI) plus untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid. If no 
Federal Income Tax Return was filed, income earned from work may be used 
in lieu of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).
    (d)(1) If the institution selects an applicant for verification for 
an award year who previously received a Direct Subsidized Loan for that 
award year, and as a result of verification the loan amount is reduced, 
the institution shall comply with the procedures specified in 
Sec. 668.61(b)(2).
    (2) If the institution selects an applicant for verification for an 
award year who previously received a loan under the Federal Stafford 
Loan Program for that award year, and as a result of verification the 
loan amount is reduced, the institution shall comply with the procedures 
for notifying the borrower and lender specified in Sec. 668.61(b) and 
Sec. 682.604(h).
    (e) If the applicant has received funds based on information which 
may be incorrect and the institution has made a reasonable effort to 
resolve the alleged discrepancy, but cannot do so, the institution shall 
forward the applicant's name, social security number, and other relevant 
information to the Secretary.

during the established additional time period, and the EFC on the two 
SARs or ISIRs are different, payment must be based on the higher of the 
two EFCs.
    (2) If the applicant does not provide to the institution the 
requested documentation and, if necessary, a verified SAR or the 
institution does not receive a verified ISIR, within the additional time

award year in excess of the student's financial need for the loan, the 
institution shall withhold and promptly return to the lender or escrow 
agent any disbursement not yet

[[Page 486]]

delivered to the student that exceeds the amount of assistance for which 
the student is eligible, taking into account other financial aid 
received by the student. However, instead of returning the entire 
undelivered disbursement, the school may choose to return promptly to

ineligible. In either case, the institution shall provide the lender 
with a written statement describing the reason for the returned loan 
funds.

    (c) The failure of a participating institution or any of the 
institution's third-party servicers to administer a Title IV, HEA 
program, or to account for the funds that the institution or servicer

institution, or the limitation, suspension, or termination of the 
institution's participation in that program; or
    (2) An emergency action against the servicer, a fine on the 
servicer, or the limitation, suspension, or termination of the 
servicer's eligibility to contract with any institution to administer 
any aspect of the institution's participation in that program.
    (d)(1) A participating institution or a third-party servicer with 
which the institution contracts violates its fiduciary duty if--
    (i)(A) The servicer has been convicted of, or has pled nolo 
contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or 
expenditure of Federal, State, or local government funds, or has been 
administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any 
other material violation of law involving those funds;

expenditure of Federal, State, or local government funds, or has been 
administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any 
other material violation of law involving those funds;

Federal, State, or local government funds, or who has been 
administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any 
other material violation of law involving those funds; or
    (D) The servicer uses or contracts in a capacity that involves any 
aspect of the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs with any 
other person, agency, or organization that has been or whose officers or 
employees have been--
    (1) Convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime 
involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of Federal, State, or 
local government funds; or
    (2) Administratively or judicially determined to have committed

or local government funds; and
    (ii) Upon learning of a conviction, plea, or administrative or 
judicial determination described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, 
the institution or servicer, as applicable, does not promptly remove the 
person, agency, or organization from any involvement in the 
administration of the institution's participation in Title IV, HEA 
programs, or, as applicable, the removal or elimination of any 
substantial control, as determined according to Sec. 668.15, over the 
servicer.

section is grounds for terminating--
    (i) The servicer's eligibility to contract with any institution to 
administer any aspect of the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program; and
    (ii) The participation in any Title IV, HEA program of any

if that institution had been aware of the violation and had failed to 
take the appropriate action described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this 
section.

or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; and
    (ii) Upon learning of the debarment, suspension, or cause for 
debarment or suspension, the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
does not promptly--
    (A) Discontinue the affiliation; or
    (B) Remove the principal from responsibility for any aspect of the 
administration of an institution's or servicer's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs.
    (2) A violation for a reason contained in paragraph (e)(1) of this

and
    (ii) The servicer's eligibility to contract with any institution to 
administer any aspect of the institution's participation in any Title

this subpart, the participation in any Title IV, HEA program of any 
institution under whose contract the servicer committed the violation, 
if that institution knew or should have known of the violation.
    (f)(1) The debarment of a participating institution or third-party

    (b)(1) An initiating official begins an emergency action against an 
institution or third-party servicer by sending the institution or 
servicer a notice by registered mail, return receipt requested. In an 
emergency action against a third-party servicer, the official also sends 
the notice to each institution that contracts with the servicer. The 
official also may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means 
if practical.
    (2) The emergency action takes effect on the date the initiating 
official mails the notice to the institution or servicer, as applicable.
    (3) The notice states the grounds on which the emergency action is 
based, the consequences of the emergency action, and that the 
institution or servicer, as applicable, may request an opportunity to 
show cause why the emergency action is unwarranted.
    (c)(1) An initiating official takes emergency action against an 
institution or third-party servicer only if that official--
    (i) Receives information, determined by the official to be reliable, 
that the institution or servicer, as applicable, is violating any

agreement, or limitation entered into under the authority of statutes 
applicable to Title IV of the HEA;
    (ii) Determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse 
of Title IV, HEA program funds; and
    (iii) Determines that the likelihood of loss from that misuse 
outweighs the importance of awaiting completion of any proceeding that 
may be initiated to limit, suspend, or terminate, as applicable--
    (A) The participation of the institution in one or more Title IV, 
HEA programs; or
    (B) The eligibility of the servicer to contract with any institution 
to administer any aspect of the institution's participation in a Title 
IV, HEA program.
    (2) Examples of violations of a Title IV, HEA program requirement 
that cause misuse and the likely loss of Title IV, HEA program funds 
include--

of Title IV, HEA program funds in an amount that exceeds--
    (A) The amount for which students are eligible; or
    (B) The amount of principal, interest, or special allowance payments 
that would have been payable to the holder of a Federal Stafford or 
Federal PLUS loan if a refund allocable to that loan had been made in 
the amount and at the time required;
    (ii) Using, offering to make available, or causing the use or 
availability of Title IV, HEA program funds for educational services if-

provide those services in full; or
    (C) The institution, or servicer, as applicable, lacks the 
administrative or financial ability to make all required payments under 
Sec. 668.22; and
    (iii) Engaging in fraud involving the administration of a Title IV, 
HEA program. Examples of fraud include--
    (A) Falsification of any document received from a student or 
pertaining to a student's eligibility for assistance under a Title IV, 
HEA program;
    (B) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted by the institution or servicer to the Secretary;
    (C) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
used for or pertaining to--
    (1) The legal authority of an institution to provide postsecondary 
education in the State in which the institution is located; or
    (2) The accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution or any 
of the institution's educational programs or locations;
    (D) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted to a guaranty agency under the Federal Stafford Loan or

servicer pertaining to the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program; and
    (F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
pertaining to the performance of any loan collection activity, including 
activity that is not required by the HEA or applicable program 
regulations.
    (3) If the Secretary begins an emergency action against a third-
party servicer, the Secretary may also begin an emergency action against 
any institution under whose contract a third-party servicer commits the 
violation.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after 
an emergency action becomes effective, an institution or third-party 
servicer, as applicable, may not--
    (i) Make or increase awards or make other commitments of aid to a 
student under the applicable Title IV, HEA program;
    (ii) Disburse either program funds, institutional funds, or other

in the Federal Stafford Loan or Federal PLUS programs--

[[Page 492]]

    (A) Certify an application for a loan under that program;
    (B) Deliver loan proceeds to a student under that program; or
    (C) Retain the proceeds of a loan made under that program that are 
received after the emergency action takes effect; or
    (iv) In the case of an emergency action against a third-party 
servicer, administer any aspect of any institution's participation in 
any Title IV, HEA program.
    (2) If the initiating official withdraws, by an emergency action, 
the authority of the institution or servicer to commit, disburse, 
deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, 
HEA program funds, or the authority of the servicer to administer any 
aspect of any institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program, 
except in accordance with a particular procedure specified in the notice 
of emergency action, the institution or servicer, as applicable, may not 
take any action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section except in 
accordance with the procedure specified in the notice.
    (e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
the Secretary provides the institution or servicer, as soon as 
practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action 
is unwarranted or should be modified.
    (2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity to 
present evidence and argument to a show-cause official. The initiating 
official does not act as the show-cause official for any emergency 
action that the initiating official has begun. The show-cause official 
is authorized to grant relief from the emergency action. The institution 
or servicer may make its presentation in writing or, upon its request, 
at an informal meeting with the show-cause official.
    (3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner in which 
argument and evidence may be presented in order to avoid unnecessary 
delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant, or repetitious 
matter.
    (4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the burden of 
persuading the show-cause official that the emergency action imposed by 
the notice is unwarranted or should be modified because--
    (i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer, exist;
    (ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss or misuse 
of Title IV, HEA program funds; or
    (iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use 
procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss from the misuse 
described in the notice.
    (5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes the 
emergency action promptly after consideration of any argument and 
evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as applicable, and 
the initiating official.
    (6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, of that official's determination promptly after the 
completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no meeting is requested, 
after the official receives all the material submitted by the 
institution in opposition to the emergency action. In the case of a 
notice to a third-party servicer, the official also notifies each 
institution that contracts with the servicer of that determination. The 
show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or 
modifying the statement of reasons provided in the notice of emergency 
action.
    (f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30 days after 
initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation, suspension, or 
termination proceeding under this part or under 34 CFR part 600 against 
the institution or servicer, as applicable, within that 30-day period, 
in which case the emergency action continues until a final decision is 
issued in that proceeding, as provided in Sec. 668.90(c), as applicable.
    (2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a 
proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, any action 
affecting the emergency action is at the sole discretion of the 
initiating official, or, if a show- cause proceeding is conducted, the 
show-cause official.
    (3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by virtue of 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or

[[Page 493]]

servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the show-
cause official to demonstrate that because of facts occurring after the 
later of the notice by the initiating official or the show-cause 
meeting, continuation of the emergency action is unwarranted and the 
emergency action should be modified or ended. The show-cause official 
considers any written material submitted and issues a determination that 
continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action.
    (g) The expiration of an emergency action, or its modification or 
revocation by the show-cause official, does not bar subsequent emergency 
action on a ground other than one specifically identified in the notice 
imposing the prior emergency action. Separate grounds may include 
violation of an agreement or limitation imposed or resulting from the 
prior emergency action.

third-party servicer commits the violation.
    (b) Procedures. (1) A designated department official begins a fine 
proceeding by sending the institution or servicer, as applicable, a 
notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. In the case of a 
fine proceeding against a third-party servicer, the official also sends 
the notice to each institution that is affected by the alleged 
violations identified as the basis for the fine action, and, to the 
extent possible, to each institution that contracts with the servicer 
for the same service affected by the violation. This notice--
    (i) Informs the institution or servicer of the Secretary's intent to 
fine the institution or servicer, as applicable, and the amount of the 
fine and identifies the alleged violations that constitute the basis for 
the action;
    (ii) Specifies the proposed effective date of the fine, which is at

applicable, by that date a written request for a hearing or written 
material indicating why the fine should not be imposed; and
    (iv) In the case of a fine proceeding against a third-party 
servicer, informs each institution that is affected by the alleged 
violations of the consequences of the action to the institution.
    (2) If the institution or servicer does not request a hearing but 
submits written material, the designated department official, after 
considering that material, notifies the institution or, in the case of a 
third-party servicer, the servicer and each institution affected by the 
alleged violations that--
    (i) The fine will not be imposed; or
    (ii) The fine is imposed as of a specified date, and in a specified 
amount.
    (3) If the institution or servicer requests a hearing by the time 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the designated 
department official sets the date and the place. The date is at least 15 
days after the designated department official receives the request.

considering that material, notifies the institution or, in the case of a 
third-party servicer, the servicer and each institution that contracts 
with the servicer that--
    (i) The proposed suspension is dismissed; or

the case of a limitation or termination proceeding against a third-party 
servicer, the official also sends the notice to each institution that 
contracts with the servicer. The designated department official may also 
transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means if practical. This 
notice--
    (i) Informs the institution or servicer of the intent of the 
Secretary to limit or terminate the institution's participation or 
servicer's eligibility, as applicable, cites the consequences of that 
action, and identifies the alleged violations that constitute the basis 
for the action, and, in the case of a limitation proceeding, states the 
limits to be imposed;
    (ii) Specifies the proposed effective date of the limitation or 
termination, which is at least 20 days after the date of mailing of the 
notice of intent;
    (iii) Informs the institution or servicer that the limitation or 
termination will not be effective on the date specified in the notice if 
the designated department official receives from the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, by that date a request for a hearing or written 
material indicating why the limitation or termination should not take 
place; and
    (iv) In the case of a limitation or termination proceeding against a 
third-party servicer, informs each institution that contracts with the 
servicer of the consequences of the action to the institution.
    (2) If the institution or servicer does not request a hearing but 
submits written material, the designated department official, after 
considering that material, notifies the institution or, in the case of a 
third-party servicer, the servicer and each institution that contracts 
with the servicer that--
    (i) The proposed action is dismissed;
    (ii) Limitations are effective as of a specified date; or
    (iii) The termination is effective as of a specified date.
    (3) If the institution or servicer requests a hearing by the time 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the designated 
department official sets the date and place. The date is at least

[[Page 496]]

15 days after the designated department official receives the request. 
The limitation or termination does not take place until after the 
requested hearing is held.
    (4) A hearing official conducts a hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 668.88.
    (c) Expedited proceeding. With the approval of the hearing official 
and the consent of the designated department official and the

Sec. 668.90  Initial and final decisions--Appeals.

    (a)(1)(i) A hearing official issues a written initial decision in a 
hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested to--
    (A) The designated department official who began a proceeding 
against an institution or third-party servicer;
    (B) The institution or servicer, as applicable; and
    (C) In the case of a proceeding against a third-party servicer, each 
institution that contracts with the servicer.
    (ii) The hearing official may also transmit the notice by other, 
more expeditious means if practical.
    (iii) The hearing official issues the decision within the latest of 
the following dates:
    (A) The 30th day after the last submission is filed with the hearing 
official.
    (B) The 60th day after the last submission is filed with the hearing 
official if the Secretary, upon request of the hearing official, 
determines that the unusual complexity of the case requires additional 
time for preparation of the decision.
    (C) The 50th day after the last day of the hearing, if the hearing 
official does not request the parties to make any posthearing 
submission.
    (2) The hearing official's initial decision states whether the 
imposition of the fine, limitation, suspension, or termination sought by 
the designated department official is warranted, in whole or in part. If 
the designated department official brought a termination action against 
the institution or servicer, the hearing official may, if appropriate, 
issue an initial decision to fine the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, or, rather than terminating the institution's participation 
or servicer's eligibility, as applicable, impose one or more limitations 
on the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section--
    (i) If, in a termination action against an institution, the hearing 
official finds that the institution has violated the provisions of 
Sec. 668.14(b)(18), the hearing official also finds that termination of 
the institution's participation is warranted;
    (ii) If, in a termination action against a third-party servicer, the 
hearing official finds that the servicer has violated the provisions of 
Sec. 668.82(d)(1), the hearing official also finds that termination of 
the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility, as 
applicable, is warranted;
    (iii) If an action brought against an institution or third-party 
servicer involves its failure to provide surety in the amount specified 
by the Secretary under Sec. 668.15, the hearing official finds that the 
amount of the surety established by the Secretary was appropriate, 
unless the institution can demonstrate that the amount was unreasonable;
    (iv) In a termination action taken against an institution or third-
party servicer based on the grounds that the institution or servicer 
failed to comply with the requirements of Sec. 668.23(c)(3), if the 
hearing official finds that the institution or servicer failed to meet 
those requirements, the hearing official finds that the termination is 
warranted;
    (v) In a termination action against an institution based on the 
grounds that the institution is not financially responsible under 
Sec. 668.15(c)(1), the hearing official finds that the termination is 
warranted unless the institution demonstrates that all applicable 
conditions described in Sec. 668.15(d)(4) have been met; and

[[Page 498]]

    (vi) In a termination action against an institution or third-party 
servicer on the grounds that the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
engaged in fraud involving the administration of any Title IV, HEA 
program, the hearing official finds that the termination action is 
warranted if the hearing official finds that the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, engaged in that fraud. Examples of fraud 
include--
    (A) Falsification of any document received from a student or 
pertaining to a student's eligibility for assistance under a Title IV, 
HEA program;
    (B) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted by the institution or servicer to the Department of Education;
    (C) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
used for or pertaining to--
    (1) The legal authority of an institution to provide postsecondary 
education in the State in which the institution is located; or
    (2) The accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution or any 
of the institution's educational programs or locations;
    (D) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted to a guaranty agency under the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal 
PLUS, and Federal SLS programs, an independent auditor, an eligible 
institution, or a third-party servicer;
    (E) Falsification of any document submitted to a third-party 
servicer by an institution or to an institution by a third-party 
servicer pertaining to the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program; and
    (F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
pertaining to the performance of any loan collection activity, including 
activity that is not required by the HEA or applicable program 
regulations.
    (4) The hearing official bases findings of fact only on evidence 
considered at the hearing and on matters given judicial notice. If a 
hearing is conducted solely through written submissions, the parties 
must agree to findings of fact.
    (b)(1) In a suspension proceeding, the Secretary reviews the hearing 
official's initial decision and issues a final decision within 20 days 
after the initial decision. The Secretary adopts the initial decision 
unless it is clearly unsupported by the evidence presented at the 
hearing.
    (2) The Secretary notifies the institution or servicer and, in the 
case of a suspension proceeding against a third-party servicer, each 
institution that contracts with the servicer of the final decision. If 
the Secretary suspends the institution's participation or servicer's 
eligibility, the suspension takes effect on the later of--
    (i) The day that the institution or servicer receives the notice; or
    (ii) The date specified in the designated department official's 
original notice of intent to suspend the institution's participation or 
servicer's eligibility.
    (3) A suspension may not exceed 60 days unless a designated 
department official begins a limitation or termination proceeding under 
this subpart before the expiration of that period. In that case, the 
period may be extended until a final decision is issued in that 
proceeding according to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c)(1) In a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding, the hearing 
official's initial decision automatically becomes the Secretary's final 
decision 30 days after the initial decision is issued and received by 
both parties unless, within that 30-day period, the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, or the designated department official appeals 
the initial decision to the Secretary.
    (2)(i) A party may appeal the hearing official's initial decision by 
submitting to the Secretary, within 30 days after the party receives the 
initial decision, a brief or other written statement that explains why 
the party believes that the Secretary should reverse or modify the 
decision of the hearing official.
    (ii) At the time the party files its appeal submission, the party 
shall provide a copy of that submission to the opposing party.
    (iii) The opposing party shall submit its brief or other responsive 
statement to the Secretary, with a copy to the appellant, within 30 days 
after the opposing party receives the appellant's brief or written 
statement.

[[Page 499]]

    (iv) The appealing party may submit proposed findings of fact or 
conclusions of law. However, the proposed findings of fact must be 
supported by--
    (A) The evidence introduced into the record at the hearing;
    (B) Stipulations of the parties if the hearing consisted of written 
submissions; or
    (C) Matters that may be judicially noticed.
    (v) Neither party may introduce new evidence on appeal.
    (vi) The initial decision of the hearing official imposing a fine or 
limiting or terminating the institution's participation or servicer's 
eligibility does not take effect pending the appeal.
    (vii) The Secretary renders a final decision. The Secretary may 
delegate to a designated department official the functions described in 
paragraph (c)(2) (vii) through (ix) of this section.
    (viii) In rendering a final decision, the Secretary considers only 
evidence introduced into the record at the hearing and facts agreed to 
by the parties if the hearing consisted only of written submissions and 
matters that may be judicially noticed.
    (ix) If the hearing official finds that a termination is warranted 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary may affirm, 
modify, or reverse the initial decision, or may remand the case to the 
hearing official for further proceedings consistent with the Secretary's 
decision. If the Secretary affirms the initial decision without issuing 
a statement of reasons, the Secretary adopts the opinion of the hearing 
official as the decision of the Secretary. If the Secretary modifies, 
remands, or reverses the initial decision, in whole or in part, the 
Secretary's decision states the reasons for the action taken.

previously and had failed to make the appropriate corrections to the 
system; and
    (ii) The financial loss of Title IV, HEA program funds was

Sec. 668.98  Interlocutory appeals to the Secretary from rulings of a hearing official.

    (a) A ruling by a hearing official may not be appealed to the 
Secretary until the issuance of an initial decision, except that the 
Secretary may, at any time prior to the issuance of the initial 
decision, grant a review of a ruling upon either a certification by a 
hearing official of the ruling to the Secretary for review or the filing 
of a petition for review of a ruling by one or both of the parties, if--
    (1) That ruling involves a controlling question of substantive or 
procedural law; and
    (2) The immediate resolution of the question will materially advance 
the final disposition of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an 
inadequate remedy.
    (b)(1) A petition for interlocutory review of an interim ruling must 
include the following:
    (i) A brief statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of 
the issue on which review is sought.
    (ii) A statement of the issue.
    (iii) A statement of the reasons showing that the ruling complained 
of involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law and 
why immediate review of the ruling will materially advance the 
disposition of the case, or why subsequent review will be an inadequate 
remedy.
    (2) A petition may not exceed ten pages, double-spaced, and must be 
filed with a copy of the ruling and any findings and opinions relating 
to the ruling.
    (c) A copy of the petition must be provided to the hearing official 
at the time of filing with the secretary, and a copy of a petition or 
any certification must be served upon the parties by certified mail, 
return receipt requested. The petition or certification must reflect 
this service.
    (d) If a party files a petition under this section, the hearing 
official may state to the Secretary a view as to whether review is 
appropriate or inappropriate by submitting a brief statement addressing 
the party's petition within 10 days of the receipt of that petition by 
the hearing official. A copy of the statement must be served on all

[[Page 504]]

parties by certified mail, return receipt requested.

petition for review may be granted by the hearing official if that 
official has certified or stated to the Secretary that review of the 
ruling is appropriate. The Secretary may order a stay of proceedings at 
any time after the filing of a request for interlocutory review.
    (g) The Secretary notifies the parties if a petition or 
certification for interlocutory review is accepted, and may provide the 
parties a reasonable time within which to submit written argument with 
regard to the merit of the petition or certification.

whether review is appropriate or inappropriate by submitting a brief 
statement addressing the party's petition within 10 days of the receipt 
of that petition by the hearing official. A copy of the statement must 
be served on all parties by certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (e) A party's response to a petition or certification for 
interlocutory review must be filed within seven days after service of 
the petition or statement, as applicable, and may not exceed ten pages, 
double-spaced, in length. A copy of the response must be served on the 
parties and the hearing official by hand delivery or regular mail.
    (f) The filing of a petition for interlocutory review does not 
automatically stay the proceedings. A stay during consideration of a 
petition for review may be granted by the hearing official if that 
official has certified or stated to the Secretary that review of the 
ruling is appropriate. The Secretary may order a stay of proceedings at 
any time after the filing of a request for interlocutory review.
    (g) The Secretary notifies the parties if a petition or 
certification for interlocutory review is accepted, and may provide the 
parties a reasonable time within which to submit written argument with 
regard to the merit of the petition or certification.
    (h) If the Secretary takes no action on a petition or certification 
for review within 15 days of receipt of it, the request is deemed to be 
denied.
    (i) The Secretary may affirm, modify, set aside, or remand the 
interim ruling of the hearing official.
    (j) The Secretary may delegate to a designated department official 
the functions described in paragraphs (f) through (i) of this section.

criteria and requirements for test approval, the Secretary notifies the 
test publisher of the Secretary's decision, and the reasons why the test 
did not meet those criteria and requirements.
    (3) The test publisher may request that the Secretary reevaluate the 
Secretary's decision. Such a request must be accompanied by--
    (i) Documentation and information that address the reasons for the 
non-approval of the test; and

the Secretary publishes a notice of that revocation in the Federal 
Register. The revocation becomes effective 120 days from the date the 
notice of revocation is published in the Federal Register; and
    (g) For test batteries that contain multiple sub-tests measuring 
content domains other than verbal and quantitative domains, the 
Secretary reviews only those subtests covering verbal and quantitative 
domains.

<R05>
Sec. 668.149  Special provisions for the approval of assessment procedures for special populations for whom no tests are reasonably available.

    If no test is reasonably available for persons with disabilities or 
students whose native language is not English and who are not fluent in 
English, so that no test can be approved under Secs. 668.146 or 668.148 
for these students, the following procedures apply:
    (a) Persons with disabilities. (1) The Secretary considers a 
modified test or testing procedure, or instrument that has been 
scientifically developed specifically for the purpose of evaluating the 
ability to benefit from postsecondary training or education of disabled 
students to be an approved test for purposes of this subpart provided 
that the testing procedure or instrument measures both basic verbal and 
quantitative skills at the secondary school level.
    (2) The Secretary considers the passing scores for these testing 
procedures or instruments to be those recommended by the test developer, 
provided that the test administrator--
    (i) Uses those procedures or instruments;
    (ii) Maintains appropriate documentation, including a description of 
the procedures or instruments, their content domains, technical 
properties, and scoring procedures; and
    (iii) Observes recommended passing scores.
    (b) Students whose native language is not English. The Secretary 
considers a test in a student's native language for a student whose 
native language is not English to be an approved test under this subpart 
if--
    (1) The Secretary has not approved any test in that native language;
    (2) The test was not previously rejected for approval by the 
Secretary;
    (3) The test measures both basic verbal and quantitative skills at 
the secondary school level; and
    (4) The passing scores and the methods for determining the passing 
scores are fully documented.

Sec. 668.150  Agreement between the Secretary and a test publisher.

    (a) If the Secretary approves a test under this subpart, the test 
publisher must enter into an agreement with the Secretary that contains 
the provisions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section before an 
institution may use the test to determine a student's eligibility for 
Title IV, HEA program funds.
    (b) The agreement between a test publisher and the Secretary 
provides that the test publisher shall--
    (1) Allow only test administrators that it certifies to give its 
test;
    (2) Certify test administrators who have--
    (i) The necessary training, knowledge, and skill to test students in 
accordance with the test publisher's testing requirements; and
    (ii) The ability and facilities to keep its test secure against 
disclosure or release;
    (3) Decertify a test administrator for a period that coincides with 
the period for which the publisher's test is approved if the test 
publisher finds that the test administrator--
    (i) Has repeatedly failed to give its test in accordance with the 
publisher's instructions;
    (ii) Has not kept the test secure;
    (iii) Has compromised the integrity of the testing process; or
    (iv) Has given the test in violation of the provisions contained in 
Sec. 668.151;
    (4) Score a test answer sheet that it receives from a test 
administrator;
    (5) If a computer-based test, provide the test administrator with 
software that will:
    (i) Immediately generate a score report for each test taker;

[[Page 520]]

    (ii) Allow the test administrator to send to the test publisher a 
secure write-protected diskette copy of the test taker's performance on 
each test item and the test taker's test scores; and
    (iii) Prohibit any changes in test taker responses or test scores.
    (6) Promptly send to the student and the institution the student 
indicated he or she is attending or scheduled to attend a notice stating 
the student's score for the test and whether or not the student passed 
the test;
    (7) Keep for a period of three years each test answer sheet or 
electronic record forwarded for scoring and all other documents 
forwarded by the test administrator with regard to the test;
    (8) Three years after the date the Secretary approves the test and 
for each subsequent three-year period, analyze the test scores of 
students to determine whether the test scores produce any irregular 
pattern that raises an inference that the tests were not being properly 
administered, and provide the Secretary with a copy of this analysis; 
and
    (9) Upon request, give the Secretary, a guaranty agency, or an 
accrediting agency access to test records or other documents related to 
an audit, investigation, or program review of the institution, test 
publisher, or test administrator.
    (c)(1) The Secretary may terminate an agreement with a test 
publisher if the test publisher fails to carry out the terms of the 
agreement described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Before terminating the agreement, the Secretary gives the test 
publisher the opportunity to show that it has not failed to carry out 
the terms of its agreement.
    (3) If the Secretary terminates an agreement with a test publisher 
under this section, the Secretary notifies institutions through 
publication in the Federal Register when they may no longer use the 
publisher's test(s) for purposes of determining a student's eligibility 
for Title IV, HEA program funds.

incentive based upon the test scores or pass rates of its students who 
take the test;
    (3) Otherwise interferes with the test administrator's independence

                       Subpart K--Cash Management

    Source: 61 FR 60603, Nov. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 668.161  Scope and purpose.

    (a) General. (1) This subpart establishes the rules and procedures 
under which a participating institution requests, maintains, disburses, 
and otherwise manages title IV, HEA program funds. This subpart is 
intended to--
    (i) Promote sound cash management of title IV, HEA program funds by 
an institution;
    (ii) Minimize the financing costs to the Federal Government of 
making title IV, HEA program funds available to a student or an 
institution; and
    (iii) Minimize the costs that accrue to a student under a title IV, 
HEA loan program.
    (2) The rules and procedures that apply to an institution under this 
subpart also apply to a third-party servicer.
    (3) As used in this subpart--
    (i) The title IV, HEA programs include only the Federal Pell Grant, 
FSEOG, Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, Direct Loan, and FFEL programs;
    (ii) The term ``parent'' means a parent borrower under the PLUS 
programs;
    (iii) With regard to the FFEL Programs, the term ``disburse'' means 
the same as deliver loan proceeds under 34 CFR part 682 of the FFEL 
Program regulations; and
    (iv) A day is a calendar day unless otherwise specified.
    (4) FWS Program. An institution must follow the disbursement 
procedures in 34 CFR 675.16 for paying a student his or her wages under 
the FWS Program instead of the disbursement procedures in 
Secs. 668.164(b) through (g) and 668.165.
    (b) Federal interest in title IV, HEA program funds. Except for 
funds received by an institution for administrative expenses and for 
funds used for the Job Location and Development Program under the FWS 
Programs, funds received by an institution under the title IV, HEA 
programs are held in trust for the intended student beneficiaries and 
the Secretary. FFEL program funds are also held in trust for the lenders 
and guaranty agencies, in addition to the student beneficiaries and the 
Secretary, under 34 CFR 682.207. The institution, as a trustee of 
Federal funds, may not use or hypothecate (i.e., use as collateral) 
title IV, HEA program funds for any other purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 668.162  Requesting funds.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary has sole discretion to determine the 
method under which the Secretary provides title IV, HEA program funds to 
an institution. In accordance with procedures established by the 
Secretary, the Secretary may provide funds to an institution under the 
advance, reimbursement, just-in-time, or cash monitoring payment 
methods.
    (2) Each time an institution requests funds from the Secretary, the 
institution must identify the amount of funds requested by program and 
fiscal year designation that the Secretary assigned to the authorization 
for those funds.
    (b) Advance payment method. Under the advance payment method--
    (1) An institution submits a request for funds to the Secretary. The 
institution's request for funds may not exceed the amount of funds the 
institution needs immediately for disbursements the institution has made 
or will make to eligible students and parents;

[[Page 525]]

    (2) If the Secretary accepts that request, the Secretary initiates 
an electronic funds transfer (EFT) of that amount to a bank account 
designated by the institution; and
    (3) The institution must disburse the funds requested as soon as 
administratively feasible but no later than three business days 
following the date the institution received those funds.
    (c) Just-in-time payment method. Under the just-in-time payment 
method--
    (1) For each student or parent that an institution determines is 
eligible for title IV, HEA program funds, the institution transmits 
electronically to the Secretary, within a timeframe established by the 
Secretary, records that contain program award information for that 
student or parent. As part of those records, the institution reports the 
date and amount of the disbursements that it will make or has made to 
that student or that student's parent;
    (2) For each record the Secretary accepts for a student or parent, 
the Secretary provides by EFT the corresponding disbursement amount to 
the institution on or before the date reported by the institution for 
that disbursement;
    (3) When the institution receives the funds for each record accepted 
by the Secretary, the institution may disburse those funds based on its 
determination at the time the institution transmitted that record to the 
Secretary that the student is eligible for that disbursement; and
    (4) The institution must report any adjustment to a previously 
accepted record within the time established by the Secretary in a notice 
published in the Federal Register.
    (d) Reimbursement payment method. Under the reimbursement payment 
method--
    (1) An institution must first make disbursements to students and 
parents for the amount of funds those students and parents are eligible 
to receive under the Federal Pell Grant, Direct Loan, and campus-based 
programs before the institution may seek reimbursement from the 
Secretary for those disbursements. The Secretary considers an 
institution to have made a disbursement if the institution has either 
credited a student's account or paid a student or parent directly with 
its own funds;
    (2) An institution seeks reimbursement by submitting to the 
Secretary a request for funds that does not exceed the amount of the 
actual disbursements the institution has made to students and parents 
included in that request;
    (3) As part of the institution's reimbursement request, the 
Secretary requires the institution to--
    (i) Identify the students for whom reimbursement is sought; and
    (ii) Submit to the Secretary or entity approved by the Secretary 
documentation that shows that each student and parent included in the 
request was eligible to receive and has received the title IV, HEA 
program funds for which reimbursement is sought; and
    (4) The Secretary approves the amount of the institution's 
reimbursement request for a student or parent and pays the institution 
that amount, if the Secretary determines with regard to that student or 
parent that the institution--
    (i) Accurately determined the student's eligibility for title IV, 
HEA program funds;
    (ii) Accurately determined the amount of title IV, HEA program funds 
paid to the student or parent; and
    (iii) Submitted the documentation required under paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section.
    (e) Cash monitoring payment method. Under the cash monitoring 
payment method, the Secretary provides title IV, HEA program funds to an 
institution under the provisions described in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) 
of this section. Under either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this 
section, an institution must first make disbursements to students and 
parents for the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that those 
students and parents are eligible to receive, before the institution--
    (1) Submits a request for funds under the provisions of the advance 
payment ethod described in paragraph (b) of this section, except that 
the institution's request may not exceed the amount of the actual 
disbursements the institution made to the students and parents included 
in that request; or

[[Page 526]]

    (2) Seeks reimbursement for those disbursements under the provisions 
of the reimbursement payment method described in paragraph (d) of this 
section, except that the Secretary may modify the documentation 
requirements and review procedures used to approve the reimbursement 
request.

    (2) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements in subpart B of 
this part; or
    (3) Applicable program regulations.
    (c) Interest-bearing or investment account. (1) An institution must 
maintain the Fund described in Sec. 674.8(a) of the Federal Perkins Loan 
Program regulations in an interest-bearing bank account or investment 
account consisting predominately of low-risk, income-producing 
securities, such as obligations issued or guaranteed by the United 
States. Interest or income earned on Fund proceeds are retained by the 
institution as part of the Fund.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an 
institution must maintain Direct Loan, Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and 
FWS program funds in an interest-bearing bank account or an investment

    (3) An institution does not have to maintain Direct Loan, Federal 
Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS program funds in an interest-bearing bank 
account or an investment account for an award year if--
    (i) The institution drew down less than a total of $3 million of 
those funds in the prior award year and anticipates that it will not 
draw down more than that amount in the current award year;
    (ii) The institution demonstrates by its cash management practices 
that it will not earn over $250 on those funds during the award year; or
    (iii) The institution requests those funds from the Secretary under 
the just-in-time payment method.
    (4) If an institution maintains Direct Loan, Federal Pell Grant, 
FSEOG, and FWS program funds in an interest-bearing or investment 
account, the institution may keep the initial $250 it earns on those 
funds during an award year. By June 30 of that award year, the 
institution must remit to the Secretary any earnings over $250.
    (d) Accounting and internal control systems and financial records. 
(1) An institution must maintain accounting and internal control systems 
that--
    (i) Identify the cash balance of the funds of each title IV, HEA 
program that are included in the institution's bank or investment 
account as readily as if those program funds were maintained in a 
separate account; and
    (ii) Identify the earnings on title IV, HEA program funds maintained 
in the institution's bank or investment account.
    (2) An institution must maintain its financial records in accordance 
with the provisions under Sec. 668.24.
    (e) Standard of conduct. An institution must exercise the level of 
care and

diligence required of a fiduciary with regard to maintaining and 
investing title IV, HEA program funds.

<R05>
Sec. 668.164  Disbursing funds.

    (a) Disbursement. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, an institution makes a disbursement of title IV, HEA program 
funds on the date that the institution credits a student's account at 
the institution or pays a student or parent directly with--
    (i) Funds received from the Secretary;
    (ii) Funds received from a lender under the FFEL Programs; or
    (iii) Institutional funds used in advance of receiving title IV, HEA 
program funds.
    (2) If, earlier than 10 days before the first day of classes of a 
payment period, or for a student subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 682.604(c)(5) or Sec. 685.303(b)(4) earlier than 30 days after the 
first day of the payment period, an institution credits a student's 
institutional account with institutional funds in advance of receiving 
title IV, HEA program funds, the Secretary considers that the 
institution makes that disbursement on the 10th day before the first day 
of classes, or the 30th day after the beginning of the payment period 
for a student subject to the requirements of Sec. 682.604(c)(5) or 
Sec. 685.303(b)(4).
    (b) Disbursements by payment period. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an institution must disburse title IV, 
HEA program funds on a payment period basis. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section, an institution may disburse title IV, HEA 
program funds to a student or parent for a payment period only if the 
student is enrolled for classes for that payment period and is eligible 
to receive those funds.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply 
to the disbursement of FWS Program funds.
    (3) For a student enrolled in an eligible program at an institution 
that measures academic progress in clock hours, in determining whether 
the student completes the clock hours in a payment period, an 
institution may include clock hours for which the student has an excused 
absence if--
    (i) The institution has a written policy that permits excused 
absences; and
    (ii) The number of excused absences under the written policy for 
purposes of this paragraph does not exceed the lesser of--
    (A) The policy on excused absences of the institution's accrediting 
agency or, if the institution has more than one accrediting agency, the 
agency designated under 34 CFR part 600.11(b);
    (B) The policy on excused absences of any State agency that licenses 
the institution or otherwise legally authorizes the institution to 
operate in the State; or
    (C) Ten percent of the clock hours in the payment period.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an ``excused 
absence'' is an absence that a student does not have to make up.
    (c) Direct payments. An institution pays a student or parent 
directly by--
    (1) Releasing to the student or parent a check provided by a lender 
to the institution under an FFEL Program;
    (2) Issuing a check or other instrument payable to and requiring the

account at the institution to satisfy current charges for--
    (i) Tuition and fees;
    (ii) Board, if the student contracts with the institution for board; 
and
    (iii) Room, if the student contracts with the institution for room.
    (2) After obtaining the appropriate authorization from a student or 
parent

[[Page 528]]

under Sec. 668.165, the institution may use title IV, HEA program funds 
to credit a student's account at the institution to satisfy--
    (i) Current charges that are in addition to the charges described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section that were incurred by the student at 
the institution for educationally related activities; and
    (ii) Minor prior award year charges if these charges are less than 
$100 or if the payment of these charges does not, and will not, prevent 
the student from paying his or her current educational costs.
    (3) If an institution disburses Direct Loan Program funds by 
crediting a student's account at the institution, the institution must 
first credit the student's account with those funds to pay for 
outstanding current and authorized charges.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph, current charges refers to 
charges assessed the student by the institution for--
    (i) The current award year; or
    (ii) The loan period for which an institution certified or 
originated a loan under the FFEL or Direct Loan programs.
    (e) Credit balances. Whenever an institution disburses title IV, HEA 
program funds by crediting a student's account and the total amount of 
all title IV, HEA program funds credited exceeds the amount of tuition 
and fees, room and board, and other authorized charges the institution 
assessed the student, the institution must pay the resulting credit 
balance directly to the student or parent as soon as possible but--
    (1) No later than 14 days after the balance occurred if the credit 
balance occurred after the first day of class of a payment period; or
    (2) No later than 14 days after the first day of class of a payment 
period if the credit balance occurred on or before the first day of 
class of that payment period.

that is offered in semester, trimester, or quarter academic terms, the 
earliest an institution may disburse title IV, HEA program funds to a 
student or parent for any payment period is 10 days before the first day 
of classes for a payment period.
    (2) If a student is enrolled in a credit-hour educational program 
that is not offered in semester, trimester, or quarter academic terms, 
or in a clock hour educational program the earliest an institution may 
disburse title IV, HEA program funds to a student or parent for any 
payment period is the later of--
    (i) Ten days before the first day of classes of the payment period; 
or
    (ii) The date the student completed the previous payment period for 
which he or she received title IV, HEA program funds, except that this 
provision does not apply to the payment of Direct Loan or FFEL program 
funds under the conditions described in 34 CFR 685.301 (b)(3)(ii), 
(b)(5), and (b)(6) and 34 CFR 682.604 (c)(6)(ii), (c)(7), and (c)(8), 
respectively.

time borrower as described in 34 CFR 682.604(c) and 34 CFR 685.303(b)(4) 
is 30 days after the first day of the student's program of study.
    (g) Late disbursements--(1) Ineligible students who may receive a 
late disbursement. (i) An institution may make a late disbursement under

for the loan period; and
    (B) For purposes of the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and Federal 
Perkins Loan programs, the student is no longer enrolled at the 
institution for the award year.

who withdraws from an institution during a payment period or period of 
enrollment can receive additional disbursements of title IV, HEA program 
funds in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 668.22 only.

[[Page 529]]

    (2) Conditions for late disbursements. An institution may disburse 
funds under a title IV, HEA program to an ineligible student and to the 
parent of an ineligible student as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section if, before the date the student became ineligible--
    (i) The institution received a SAR from the student or an ISIR from 
the Secretary and the SAR or ISIR has an official expected family 
contribution calculated by the Secretary; and
    (ii)(A) For a Direct Loan Program loan, the institution created the 
electronic origination record for that loan. An institution may not make 
a late second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Subsidized or

successfully completed the period of enrollment for which the loan was 
intended;
    (B) For an FFEL Program loan, the institution certified an 
application for that loan. An institution may not make a late second or 
subsequent disbursement of a Stafford loan unless the student has 
graduated or successfully completed the period of enrollment for which

    (D) For a Federal Pell Grant Program award, the institution received 
a valid SAR from the student or a valid ISIR from the Secretary; and
    (E) For a Federal Perkins Loan Program loan or an FSEOG Program

    (3) Making a late disbursement. If a student or a parent borrower 
qualifies for a late disbursement under paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of 
this section, the institution--
    (i) May make that late disbursement of title IV, HEA program funds 
only if the funds are used to pay for educational costs that the 
institution determines the student incurred for the period in which the 
student was enrolled and eligible; and
    (ii) Must make the late disbursement no later than 90 days after the 
date that student becomes ineligible under paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.

institution may return the loan proceeds, cancel the loan, or do both, 
in accordance with applicable program regulations.
    (5) An institution must inform a student or parent in writing or 
electronically regarding the outcome of any cancellation request.
    (b) Student or parent authorizations. (1) If an institution obtains 
written authorization from a student or parent, as applicable, the 
institution may--
    (i) Disburse title IV, HEA program funds to a bank account 
designated by the student or parent;
    (ii) Use the student's or parent's title IV, HEA program funds to 
pay for charges described in Sec. 668.164(d)(2) that are included in 
that authorization; and
    (iii) Except if prohibited by the Secretary under the reimbursement 
method, hold on behalf of the student or parent any title IV, HEA 
program funds that would otherwise be paid directly to the student or 
parent under Sec. 668.164(e).
    (2) In obtaining the student's or parent's authorization to perform 
an activity described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an 
institution--
    (i) May not require or coerce the student or parent to provide that 
authorization;
    (ii) Must allow the student or parent to cancel or modify that 
authorization at any time; and
    (iii) Must clearly explain how it will carry out that activity.
    (3) A student or parent may authorize an institution to carry out 
the activities described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the 
period during which the student is enrolled at the institution.
    (4)(i) If a student or parent modifies an authorization, the 
modification takes effect on the date the institution receives the 
modification notice.
    (ii) If a student or parent cancels an authorization to use title 
IV, HEA program funds to pay for authorized charges under 
Sec. 668.164(d)(2), the institution may use title IV, HEA program funds 
to pay only those authorized charges incurred by the student before the 
institution received the notice.
    (iii) If a student or parent cancels an authorization to hold title 
IV, HEA program funds under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the 
institution must pay those funds directly to the student or parent as 
soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the institution 
receives that notice.
    (5) If an institution holds excess student funds under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section, the institution must--
    (i) Identify the amount of funds the institution holds for each 
student or parent in a subsidiary ledger account designed for that 
purpose;
    (ii) Maintain, at all times, cash in its bank account in an amount 
at least equal to the amount of funds the institution holds for the 
student; and
    (iii) Notwithstanding any authorization obtained by the institution 
under this paragraph, pay any remaining balance on loan funds by the end 
of the loan period and any remaining other title IV, HEA program funds 
by the end of the last payment period in the award year for which they 
were awarded.

Sec. 668.166  Excess cash.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary considers excess cash to be any 
amount of title IV, HEA program funds, other than Federal Perkins Loan 
Program funds, that an institution does not disburse to students or 
parents by the end of the third business day following the

[[Page 531]]

date the institution received those funds from the Secretary. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an institution must return 
promptly to the Secretary any amount of excess cash in its account or 
accounts.
    (2) The provisions in this section do not apply to the title IV, HEA 
program funds that an institution receives from the Secretary under the 
just-in-time payment method.
    (b) Excess cash tolerances. (1) If an institution draws down title 
IV, HEA program funds in excess of its immediate cash needs, the 
institution may maintain the excess cash balance in the account the 
institution established under Sec. 668.164 only if--
    (i) In the award year preceding that drawdown, the amount of that 
excess cash balance is less than--
    (A) For a period of peak enrollment at the institution during which 
that drawdown occurs, three percent of its total prior-year drawdowns; 
or
    (B) For any other period, one percent of its total prior-year 
drawdowns; and
    (ii) Within the next seven days, the institution eliminates its 
excess cash balance by disbursing title IV, HEA program funds to 
students or parents for at least the amount of that balance.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a period of peak enrollment at 
an institution occurs when at least 25 percent of the institution's 
students start classes during a given 30-day period. For any award year, 
an institution calculates the percentage of students who started classes 
during a given 30-day period by--
    (i) For the prior award year in which the 30-day period began, 
determining the number of students who started classes during that 
period;
    (ii) Determining the total number of students who started classes 
during the entire award year used in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section;
    (iii) Dividing the number of students in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section by the number of students in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section; and
    (iv) Multiplying the result obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section by 100.
    (3) For the purpose of determining the total amount of title IV, HEA 
program funds under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an institution 
that participates in the Direct Loan Program may include, for the latest 
year for which the Secretary has complete data, the total amount of 
loans guaranteed under the FFEL Program for students attending the 
institution during that year.
    (c) Consequences for maintaining excess cash balances. (1) If the 
Secretary finds that an institution maintains in its account excess cash 
balances greater than those allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Secretary--
    (i) As provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, requires the 
institution to reimburse the Secretary for the costs the Secretary deems 
to have incurred in making those excess funds available to the 
institution; and
    (ii) May initiate a proceeding to fine, limit, suspend, or terminate 
the institution's participation in one or more title IV, HEA programs 
under subpart G of this part.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, upon a finding that an 
institution has maintained excess cash, the Secretary--
    (i) Considers the institution to have issued a check on the date 
that the check cleared the institution's bank account, unless the 
institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it 
issued the check shortly after the institution wrote the check; and
    (ii) Calculates, or requires the institution to calculate, a 
liability for maintaining excess cash balances in accordance with 
procedures established by the Secretary. Under those procedures, the 
Secretary assesses a liability that is equal to the difference between 
the earnings that the excess cash balances would have yielded if 
invested under the applicable current value of funds rate and the actual 
interest earned on those balances. The current value of funds rate is an 
annual percentage rate, published in a Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 
bulletin, that reflects the current value of funds to the Department of 
Treasury based on certain investment rates. The current value of funds 
rate is computed each year by averaging investment rates for

[[Page 532]]

the 12-month period ending every September. The TFM bulletin is 
published annually by the Department of Treasury. Each annual bulletin 
identifies the current value of funds rate and the effective date of 
that rate.

payment period for a first-year, first-time Federal Stafford Loan 
Program borrower as defined in Sec. 682.604(c)(5); or
    (ii) Thirteen days before the first day of classes for any 
subsequent payment period for a first-year, first-time Federal Stafford 
Loan Program borrower or for any payment period for all other Federal 
Stafford Loan Program borrowers; and
    (2) An institution may not request a lender to provide it with loan 
funds by check requiring the endorsement of the borrower earlier than--
    (i) The first day of classes of the first payment period for a 
first-year, first-time Federal Stafford Loan Program borrower as defined 
in Sec. 682.604(c)(5); or
    (ii) Thirty days before the first day of classes for any subsequent 
payment period for a first-year, first-time Federal Stafford Loan 
Program borrower or for any payment period for all other Federal 
Stafford borrowers; and
    (3)(i) An institution may not request a lender to provide it with 
loan funds by EFT or master check for any Federal PLUS Program loan 
earlier than 13 days before the first day of classes for any payment 
period.
    (ii) An institution may not request a lender to provide with loan 
funds by check requiring the endorsement of the borrower for any Federal 
PLUS Program loan earlier than 30 days before the first day of classes 
for any payment period.
    (b) Returning funds to a lender. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, an institution must return FFEL Program funds to a 
lender if the institution does not disburse those funds to a student or 
parent for a payment period within--
    (i) Ten business days following the date the institution receives 
the funds if the lender provides those funds to the institution by EFT 
or master check on or after July 1, 1997 but before July 1, 1999;
    (ii) Three business days following the date the institution receives 
the funds if the lender provides those funds to the institution by EFT 
and master check on or after July 1, 1999; or
    (iii) Thirty days after the institution receives the funds if a 
lender provides those funds by a check payable to the borrower or 
copayable to the borrower and the institution.
    (2) If the institution does not disburse the loan funds as specified 
in paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of this section, the institution must return 
those funds to the lender promptly but no later than 10 business days 
after the date the institution is required to disburse the funds.
    (3) If an institution must return loan funds to the lender under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the institution determines that the 
student is eligible to receive the loan funds, the school may disburse 
the funds to the student or parent rather than return them to the lender 
provided the funds are disbursed prior to the end of the applicable 
timeframe under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Delay in returning funds to a lender. An institution may delay 
returning FFEL program funds to a lender for--
    (1) Ten business days after the date set forth in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section if--
    (i)(A) The institution does not disburse FFEL Program funds to a 
borrower because the student did not complete the required number of 
clock or credit hours in a preceding payment period; and
    (B) The institution expects the student to complete required hours 
within this 10-day period; or
    (ii)(A) The student has not met all the FFEL Programs eligibility 
requirements; and

[[Page 533]]

    (B) The institution expects the student to meet those requirements 
within this 10-day period; or
    (2) Thirty days after the date set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section for funds a lender provides by EFT or master check if the 
Secretary places the institution on the reimbursement payment method 
under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.
    (d) An institution placed under the reimbursement payment method. 
(1) If the Secretary places an institution under the reimbursement 
payment method for the Federal Pell Grant, Direct Loan or campus-based 
programs, the institution--
    (i) May not disburse FFEL Program funds to a borrower until the 
Secretary approves a request from the institution to make that 
disbursement for that borrower; and
    (ii) If prohibited by the Secretary, may not certify a borrower's 
loan application until the Secretary approves a request from the 
institution to make that certification for that borrower.
    (2) In order for the Secretary to approve a disbursement or 
certification request from the institution, the institution must submit 
documentation to the Secretary or entity approved by the Secretary that 
shows that each borrower included in that request whose loan has not 
been disbursed or certified is eligible to receive that disbursement or 
certification.
    (3) Pending the Secretary's approval of a disbursement or 
certification request, the Secretary may--
    (i) Prohibit the institution from endorsing a master check or 
obtaining a borrower's endorsement of any loan check the institution 
receives from a lender;
    (ii) Require the institution to maintain loan funds that it receives

requirements under Sec. 668.164; and
    (iii) Prohibit the institution from certifying a borrower's loan 
application.
    (e) An institution participating solely in the FFEL Programs. If the 
FFEL Programs are the only title IV, HEA programs in which an 
institution participates and the Secretary determines that there is a 
need to monitor strictly the institution's participation in those 
programs, the Secretary may subject the institution to the conditions 
and limitations contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) An institution placed under the cash monitoring payment method. 
The Secretary may require an institution that is placed under the cash 
monitoring described under paragraph Sec. 668.162(e), to comply with the 
disbursement and certification provisions under paragraph (d) of this 
section, except that the Secretary may modify the documentation 
requirements and review procedures used to approve the institution's 
disbursement or certification request.

                   Subpart L--Financial Responsibility

    Source: 62 FR 62877, Nov. 25, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 668.171  General.

    (a) Purpose. To begin and to continue to participate in any title 
IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that 
it is financially responsible under the standards established in this 
subpart. As provided under section 498(c)(1) of the HEA, the Secretary 
determines whether an institution is financially responsible based on 
the institution's ability to--
    (1) Provide the services described in its official publications and 
statements;
    (2) Administer properly the title IV, HEA programs in which it 
participates; and
    (3) Meet all of its financial obligations.
    (b) General standards of financial responsibility. Except as 
provided under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the Secretary 
considers an institution to be financially responsible if the Secretary 
determines that--
    (1) The institution's Equity, Primary Reserve, and Net Income ratios 
yield a

[[Page 534]]

composite score of at least 1.5, as provided under Sec. 668.172 and 
appendices A and B to this subpart;
    (2) The institution has sufficient cash reserves to make required 
refunds, as provided under Sec. 668.173;
    (3) The institution is current in its debt payments. An institution 
is not current in its debt payments if--
    (i) It is in violation of any existing loan agreement at its fiscal 
year end, as disclosed in a note to its audited financial statements or 
audit opinion; or
    (ii) It fails to make a payment in accordance with existing debt 
obligations for more than 120 days, and at least one creditor has filed 
suit to recover funds under those obligations; and
    (4) The institution is meeting all of its financial obligations, 
including but not limited to--
    (i) Refunds that it is required to make under its refund policy, 
including the return of title IV, HEA program funds for which it is 
responsible under Sec. 668.22 and the payment of post-withdrawal 
disbursements under Sec. 668.22; and
    (ii) Repayments to the Secretary for debts and liabilities arising 
from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs.
    (c) Public institutions. The Secretary considers a public 
institution to be financially responsible if the institution--
    (1)(i) Notifies the Secretary that it is designated as a public 
institution by the State, local or municipal government entity, tribal 
authority, or other government entity that has the legal authority to 
make that designation; and
    (ii) Provides a letter from an official of that State or other 
government entity confirming that the institution is a public 
institution; and
    (2) Is not in violation of any past performance requirement under 
Sec. 668.174.
    (d) Audit opinions and past performance provisions. Even if an 
institution satisfies all of the general standards of financial 
responsibility under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary does 
not consider the institution to be financially responsible if--
    (1) In the institution's audited financial statements, the opinion 
expressed by the auditor was an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed 
opinion, or the auditor expressed doubt about the continued existence of 
the institution as a going concern, unless the Secretary determines that 
a qualified or disclaimed opinion does not have a significant bearing on 
the institution's financial condition; or
    (2) As provided under the past performance provisions in 
Sec. 668.174 (a) and (b)(1), the institution violated a title IV, HEA 
program requirement, or the persons or entities affiliated with the 
institution owe a liability for a violation of a title IV, HEA program 
requirement.
    (e) Administrative actions. If the Secretary determines that an 
institution is not financially responsible under the standards and 
provisions of this section or under an alternative standard in 
Sec. 668.175, or the institution does not submit its financial and 
compliance audits by the date permitted and in the manner required under 
Sec. 668.23, the Secretary may--
    (1) Initiate an action under subpart G of this part to fine the 
institution, or limit, suspend, or terminate the institution's 
participation in the title IV, HEA programs; or
    (2) For an institution that is provisionally certified, take an 
action against the institution under the procedures established in 
Sec. 668.13(d).

Sec. 668.172  Financial ratios.

    (a) Appendices A and B, ratio methodology. As provided under 
appendices A and B to this subpart, the Secretary determines an 
institution's composite score by--
    (1) Calculating the result of its Primary Reserve, Equity, and Net 
Income ratios, as described under paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) Calculating the strength factor score for each of those ratios 
by using the corresponding algorithm;
    (3) Calculating the weighted score for each ratio by multiplying the 
strength

[[Page 535]]

factor score by its corresponding weighting percentage;
    (4) Summing the resulting weighted scores to arrive at the composite 
score; and
    (5) Rounding the composite score to one digit after the decimal 
point.
    (b) Ratios. The Primary Reserve, Equity, and Net Income ratios are 
defined under appendix A for proprietary institutions, and under 
appendix B for private non-profit institutions.
    (1) The ratios for proprietary institutions are:
    For proprietary institutions:

    (2) The ratios for private non-profit institutions are:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25NO97.023
    
    (c) Excluded items. In calculating an institution's ratios, the 
Secretary--
    (1) Generally excludes extraordinary gains or losses, income or 
losses from discontinued operations, prior period adjustments, the 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and the effect of 
changes in accounting estimates;
    (2) May include or exclude the effects of questionable accounting 
treatments, such as excessive capitalization of marketing costs;
    (3) Excludes all unsecured or uncollateralized related-party 
receivables;
    (4) Excludes all intangible assets defined as intangible in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and
    (5) Excludes from the ratio calculations Federal funds provided to 
an institution by the Secretary under program authorized by the HEA only 
if--
    (i) In the notes to the institution's audited financial statement, 
or as a separate attestation, the auditor discloses by name and CFDA 
number, the amount of HEA program funds reported as expenses in the 
Statement of Activities for the fiscal year covered by that audit or 
attestation; and
    (ii) The institution's composite score, as determined by the 
Secretary, is less than 1.5 before the reported expenses

[[Page 536]]

arising from those HEA funds are excluded from the ratio calculations.

<R05>
Sec. 668.173  Refund reserve standards.

    (a) General. The Secretary considers that an institution has 
sufficient cash reserves (as required under Sec. 668.171(b)(2)) to make 
refunds that it is required to make under its refund policy, including 
the return of title IV, HEA program funds for which it is responsible 
under Sec. 668.22 and the payment of post-withdrawal disbursements under 
Sec. 668.22 if the institution--
    (1) Satisfies the requirements of a public institution under 
Sec. 668.171(c)(1);
    (2) Is located in a State that has a tuition recovery fund approved 
by the Secretary and the institution contributes to that fund; or
    (3) Demonstrates that it makes its refunds timely, as provided under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Timely refunds. An institution demonstrates that it makes 
required refunds, including payments required under Sec. 668.22, if the 
auditor or auditors who conducted the institution's compliance audits 
for the institution's two most recently completed fiscal years, or the 
Secretary or a State or guaranty agency that conducted a review of the 
institution covering those fiscal years--
    (1) Finds in the sample of student records audited or reviewed for 
each of those fiscal years that--
    (i) The institution made late refunds to 5 percent or more of the 
students in that sample. For purposes of determining the percentage of 
late refunds under this paragraph, the auditor or reviewer must include 
in the sample only those title IV, HEA program recipients who received 
or should have received a refund or for whom a repayment of unearned 
title IV, HEA program funds was made or should have been made under 
Sec. 668.22; or
    (ii) The institution made only one late refund or repayment of 
unearned title IV, HEA program funds for a student in that sample; and
    (2) Did not note for either of those fiscal years a material 
weakness or a reportable condition in the institution's report on 
internal controls that is related to refunds.
    (c) Refund findings. Upon a finding that an institution no longer 
satisfies a refund standard under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this 
section, or that the institution is not making its refunds timely under 
paragraph (b) of this section, the institution must submit an 
irrevocable letter of credit, acceptable and payable to the Secretary, 
equal to 25 percent of the total amount of title IV, HEA program refunds 
the institution made or should have made during its most recently 
completed fiscal year. The institution must submit this letter of credit 
to the Secretary no later than--
    (1) Thirty days after the date the institution is required to submit 
its compliance audit to the Secretary under Sec. 668.23, if the finding 
is made by the auditor who conducted that compliance audit; or
    (2) Thirty days after the date that the Secretary, or the State or 
guaranty agency that conducted a review of the institution notifies the 
institution of the finding. The institution must also notify the 
Secretary of that finding and of the State or guaranty agency that 
conducted that review of the institution.
    (d) State tuition recovery funds. In determining whether to approve 
a State's tuition recovery fund, the Secretary considers the extent to 
which that fund--
    (1) Provides refunds to both in-State and out-of-State students;
    (2) Allocates all refunds in accordance with the order required 
under Sec. 668.22; and
    (3) Provides a reliable mechanism for the State to replenish the 
fund should any claims arise that deplete the fund's assets.

Sec. 668.174  Past performance.

    (a) Past performance of an institution. An institution is not 
financially responsible if the institution--
    (1) Has been limited, suspended, terminated, or entered into a 
settlement agreement to resolve a limitation, suspension, or termination 
action initiated by the Secretary or a guaranty agency, as defined in 34 
CFR part 682, within the preceding five years;
    (2) In either of its two most recent compliance audits had an audit 
finding, or in a report issued by the Secretary had a program review 
finding for its current fiscal year or either of its preceding two 
fiscal years, that resulted in the institution's being required to repay 
an amount greater than 5 percent of the funds that the institution 
received under the title IV, HEA programs during the year covered by 
that audit or program review;
    (3) Has been cited during the preceding five years for failure to 
submit in a timely fashion acceptable compliance and financial statement

identified in audit or program review reports based upon a final 
decision of the Secretary issued pursuant to subpart G or H of this 
part.
    (b) Past performance of persons affiliated with an institution. 
(1)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an

substantial control over the institution, as described under 34 CFR 
600.30, or any member or members of that person's family, alone or 
together--
    (A) Exercises or exercised substantial control over another 
institution or a third-party servicer that owes a liability for a 
violation of a title IV, HEA program requirement; or
    (B) Owes a liability for a violation of a title IV, HEA program 
requirement; and
    (ii) That person, family member, institution, or servicer does not 
demonstrate that the liability is being repaid in accordance with an 
agreement with the Secretary.
    (2) The Secretary may determine that an institution is financially 
responsible, even if the institution is not otherwise financially 
responsible under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if--
    (i) The institution notifies the Secretary, within the time 
permitted and in the manner provided under 34 CFR 600.30, that the 
person referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section exercises 
substantial control over the institution; and
    (ii) The person referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
repaid to the Secretary a portion of the applicable liability, and the 
portion repaid equals or exceeds the greater of--
    (A) The total percentage of the ownership interest held in the 
institution or third-party servicer that owes the liability by that 
person or any member or members of that person's family, either alone or 
in combination with one another;
    (B) The total percentage of the ownership interest held in the 
institution or servicer that owes the liability that the person or any 
member or members of the person's family, either alone or in combination 
with one another, represents or represented under a voting trust, power 
of attorney, proxy, or similar agreement; or
    (C) Twenty-five percent, if the person or any member of the person's 
family is or was a member of the board of directors, chief executive

owes the liability, or of an entity holding at least a 25 percent 
ownership interest in the institution that owes the liability; or
    (iii) The applicable liability described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is currently being repaid in accordance with a written agreement 
with the Secretary; or
    (iv) The institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the

[[Page 538]]

and each member of that person's family nevertheless does not or did not 
exercise substantial control over the institution or servicer that owes

    (c) Ownership interest. (1) An ownership interest is a share of the 
legal or beneficial ownership or control of, or a right to share in the

    (3) The Secretary generally considers a person to exercise 
substantial control over an institution or third-party servicer if the 
person--
    (i) Directly or indirectly holds at least a 25 percent ownership

percent ownership in the institution or servicer; or
    (iv) Is a member of the board of directors, a general partner, the 
chief executive officer, or other executive officer of--
    (A) The institution or servicer; or
    (B) An entity that holds at least a 25 percent ownership interest in 
the institution or servicer.

Sec. 668.175  Alternative standards and requirements.

    (a) General. An institution that is not financially responsible 
under the general standards and provisions in Sec. 668.171, may begin or 
continue to participate in the title IV, HEA programs by qualifying 
under an alternate standard set forth in this section.
    (b) Letter of credit alternative for new institutions. A new 
institution that is not financially responsible solely because the 
Secretary determines that its composite score is less than 1.5, 
qualifies as a financially responsible institution by submitting an 
irrevocable letter of credit, that is acceptable and payable to the 
Secretary, for an amount equal to at least one-half of the amount of 
title IV, HEA program funds that the Secretary determines the 
institution will receive during its initial year of participation. A new 
institution is an institution that seeks to participate for the first 
time in the title IV, HEA programs.
    (c) Letter of credit alternative for participating institutions. A 
participating institution that is not financially responsible either 
because it does not satisfy one or more of the standards of financial 
responsibility under Sec. 668.171(b), or because of an audit opinion 
described under Sec. 668.171(d), qualifies as a financially responsible 
institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit, that is 
acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount determined by the 
Secretary that is not less than one-half of the title IV, HEA program 
funds received by the institution during its most recently completed 
fiscal year.
    (d) Zone alternative. (1) A participating institution that is not 
financially responsible solely because the Secretary determines that its 
composite score is less than 1.5 may participate in the title IV, HEA 
programs

[[Page 539]]

as a financially responsible institution for no more than three 
consecutive years, beginning with the year in which the Secretary 
determines that the institution qualifies under this alternative. (i)(A) 
An institution qualifies initially under this alternative if, based on 
the institution's audited financial statement for its most recently 
completed fiscal year, the Secretary determines that its composite score 
is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4; and
    (B) An institution continues to qualify under this alternative if, 
based on the institution's audited financial statement for each of its 
subsequent two fiscal years, the Secretary determines that the 
institution's composite score is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4.
    (ii) An institution that qualified under this alternative for three 
consecutive years or for one of those years, may not seek to qualify 
again under this alternative until the year after the institution 
achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, as determined by the 
Secretary.
    (2) Under this zone alternative, the Secretary--
    (i) Requires the institution to make disbursements to eligible 
students and parents under either the cash monitoring or reimbursement 
payment method described in Sec. 668.162;
    (ii) Requires the institution to provide timely information 
regarding any of the following oversight and financial events--
    (A) Any adverse action, including a probation or similar action, 
taken against the institution by its accrediting agency;
    (B) Any event that causes the institution, or related entity as 
defined in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 57, to 
realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in the 
institution's or related entity's most recent audited financial 
statement;
    (C) Any violation by the institution of any loan agreement;
    (D) Any failure of the institution to make a payment in accordance 
with its debt obligations that results in a creditor filing suit to 
recover funds under those obligations;
    (E) Any withdrawal of owner's equity from the institution by any 
means, including by declaring a dividend; or
    (F) Any extraordinary losses, as defined in accordance with 
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30.
    (iii) May require the institution to submit its financial statement 
and compliance audits earlier than the time specified under 
Sec. 668.23(a)(4); and
    (iv) May require the institution to provide information about its 
current operations and future plans.
    (3) Under the zone alternative, the institution must--
    (i) For any oversight or financial event described under paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section for which the institution is required to 
provide information, provide that information to the Secretary by 
certified mail or electronic or facsimile transmission no later than 10 
days after that event occurs. An institution that provides this 
information electronically or by facsimile transmission is responsible 
for confirming that the Secretary received a complete and legible copy 
of that transmission; and
    (ii) As part of its compliance audit, require its auditor to express 
an opinion on the institution's compliance with the requirements under 
the zone alternative, including the institution's administration of the 
payment method under which the institution received and disbursed title 
IV, HEA program funds.
    (4) If an institution fails to comply with the requirements under 
paragraphs (d) (2) or (3) of this section, the Secretary may determine 
that the institution no longer qualifies under this alternative.
    (e) Transition year alternative. A participating institution that is 
not financially responsible solely because the Secretary determines that 
its composite score is less than 1.5 for the institution's fiscal year 
that began on or after July 1, 1997 but on or before June 30, 1998, may 
qualify as a financially responsible institution under the provisions in 
Sec. 668.15(b)(7), (b)(8), (d)(2)(ii), or (d)(3), as applicable.
    (f) Provisional certification alternative. (1) The Secretary may 
permit an institution that is not financially responsible to participate 
in the title IV, HEA

[[Page 540]]

programs under a provisional certification for no more than three 
consecutive years if--
    (i) The institution is not financially responsible because it does 
not satisfy the general standards under Sec. 668.171(b) or because of an 
audit opinion described under Sec. 668.171(d); or
    (ii) The institution is not financially responsible because of a 
condition of past performance, as provided under Sec. 668.174(a), and 
the institution demonstrates to the Secretary that it has satisfied or 
resolved that condition.
    (2) Under this alternative, the institution must--
    (i) Submit to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is 
acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount determined by the 
Secretary that is not less than 10 percent of the title IV, HEA program 
funds received by the institution during its most recently completed 
fiscal year, except that this requirement does not apply to a public 
institution;
    (ii) Demonstrate that it was current on its debt payments and has 
met all of its financial obligations, as required under Sec. 668.171 
(b)(3) and (b)(4), for its two most recent fiscal years; and
    (iii) Comply with the provisions under the zone alternative, as 
provided under paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (3) If at the end of the period for which the Secretary 
provisionally certified the institution, the institution is still not 
financially responsible, the Secretary may again permit the institution 
to participate under a provisional certification, but the Secretary--
    (i) May require the institution, or one or more persons or entities 
that exercise substantial control over the institution, as determined 
under Sec. 668.174(b)(1) and (c), or both, to submit to the Secretary 
financial guarantees for an amount determined by the Secretary to be 
sufficient to satisfy any potential liabilities that may arise from the 
institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs; and
    (ii) May require one or more of the persons or entities that 
exercise substantial control over the institution, as determined under 
Sec. 668.174(b)(1) and (c), to be jointly or severally liable for any 
liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the 
title IV, HEA programs.
    (g) Provisional certification alternative for persons or entities 
owing liabilities. (1) The Secretary may permit an institution that is 
not financially responsible because the persons or entities that 
exercise substantial control over the institution owe a liability for a 
violation of a title IV, HEA program requirement, to participate in the 
title IV, HEA programs under a provisional certification only if--
    (i)(A) The persons or entities that exercise substantial control, as 
determined under Sec. 668.174(b)(1) and (c), repay or enter into an 
agreement with the Secretary to repay the applicable portion of that 
liability, as provided under Sec. 668.174(b)(2)(ii); or
    (B) The institution assumes that liability, and repays or enters 
into an agreement with the Secretary to repay that liability;
    (ii) The institution satisfies the general standards and provisions 
of financial responsibility under Sec. 668.171(b) and (d)(1), except 
that institution must demonstrate that it was current on its debt 
payments and has met all of its financial obligations, as required under 
Sec. 668.171 (b)(3) and (b)(4), for its two most recent fiscal years; 
and
    (iii) The institution submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter 
of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount 
determined by the Secretary that is not less than 10 percent of the 
title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most 
recently completed fiscal year.
    (2) Under this alternative, the Secretary--
    (i) Requires the institution to comply with the provisions under the 
zone alternative, as provided under paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this 
section;
    (ii) May require the institution, or one or more persons or entities 
that exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, to 
submit to the Secretary financial guarantees for an amount determined by 
the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy any potential liabilities that 
may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA 
programs; and

[[Page 541]]

    (iii) May require one or more of the persons or entities that 
exercise substantial control over the institution to be jointly or 
severally liable for any liabilities that may arise from the 
institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs.

                     Subpart M--Cohort Default Rates

    Source: 65 FR 65638, Nov. 1, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 668.181  Purpose of this subpart.

    Your cohort default rate is a measure we use to determine your 
eligibility to participate in various Title IV, HEA programs. We may 
also use it for determining your eligibility for exemptions, such as 
those for certain disbursement requirements under the FFEL and Direct 
Loan Programs. This subpart describes how cohort default rates are 
calculated, some of the consequences of cohort default rates, and how 
you may request changes to your cohort default rates or appeal their 
consequences. Under this subpart, you submit a ``challenge'' after you 
receive your draft cohort default rate, and you request an 
``adjustment'' or ``appeal'' after your official cohort default rate is 
published.

<R05>
Sec. 668.182  Definitions of terms used in this subpart.

    We use the following definitions in this subpart:
    (a) Cohort. Your cohort is a group of borrowers used to determine 
your cohort default rate. The method for identifying the borrowers in a 
cohort is provided in Sec. 668.183(b).
    (b) Data manager. (1) For FFELP loans held by a guaranty agency or 
lender, the guaranty agency is the data manager.
    (2) For FFELP loans that we hold, we are the data manager.
    (3) For Direct Loan Program loans, the Direct Loan Servicer, as 
defined in 34 CFR 685.102, is the data manager.
    (c) Days. In this subpart, ``days'' means calendar days.
    (d) Default. A borrower is considered to be in default for cohort 
default rate purposes under the rules in Sec. 668.183(c).
    (e) Draft cohort default rate. Your draft cohort default rate is a 
rate we issue, for your review, before we issue your official cohort 
default rate. A draft cohort default rate is used only for the purposes 
described in Sec. 668.185.
    (f) Entering repayment. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) 
and (f)(3) of this section, loans are considered to enter repayment on 
the dates described in 34 CFR 682.200 (under the definition of 
``repayment period'') and in 34 CFR 685.207.
    (2) A Federal SLS loan is considered to enter repayment--
    (i) At the same time the borrower's Federal Stafford loan enters 
repayment, if the borrower received the Federal SLS loan and the Federal 
Stafford loan during the same period of continuous enrollment; or
    (ii) In all other cases, on the day after the student ceases to be 
enrolled at an institution on at least a half-time basis in an 
educational program leading to a degree, certificate, or other 
recognized educational credential.
    (3) For the purposes of this subpart, a loan is considered to enter 
repayment on the date that a borrower repays it in full, if the loan is 
paid in full before the loan enters repayment under paragraphs (f)(1) or 
(f)(2) of this section.
    (g) Fiscal year. A fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on the 
following September 30. A fiscal year is identified by the calendar year 
in which it ends.
    (h) Loan record detail report. The loan record detail report is a 
report that we produce. It contains the data used to calculate your 
draft or official cohort default rate.
    (i) Official cohort default rate. Your official cohort default rate 
is the cohort default rate that we publish for you under Sec. 668.186. 
Cohort default rates calculated under this subpart are not related in 
any way to cohort default rates that are calculated for the Federal 
Perkins Loan Program.
    (j) We. We are the Department, the Secretary, or the Secretary's 
designee.
    (k) You. You are an institution.

<R05>
Sec. 668.183  Calculating and applying cohort default rates.

    (a) General. This section describes the four steps that we follow to 
calculate and apply your cohort default rate for a fiscal year:

[[Page 549]]

    (1) First, under paragraph (b) of this section, we identify the 
borrowers in your cohort for the fiscal year. If the total number of 
borrowers in that cohort is fewer than 30, we also identify the 
borrowers in your cohorts for the 2 most recent prior fiscal years.
    (2) Second, under paragraph (c) of this section, we identify the 
borrowers in the cohort (or cohorts) who are considered to be in 
default. If more than one cohort will be used to calculate your cohort 
default rate, we identify defaulted borrowers separately for each 
cohort.
    (3) Third, under paragraph (d) of this section, we calculate your 
cohort default rate.
    (4) Fourth, we apply your cohort default rate to all of your 
locations--
    (i) As you exist on the date you receive the notice of your official 
cohort default rate; and
    (ii) From the date on which you receive the notice of your official 
cohort default rate until you receive our notice that the cohort default 
rate no longer applies.
    (b) Identify the borrowers in a cohort. (1) Your cohort for a fiscal 
year consists of all of your current and former students who, during 
that fiscal year, entered repayment on any Federal Stafford loan, 
Federal SLS loan, Direct Subsidized loan, or Direct Unsubsidized loan 
that they received to attend your institution, or on the portion of a 
loan made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program or the Federal 
Direct Consolidation Loan Program (as defined in 34 CFR 685.102) that is 
used to repay those loans.
    (2) A borrower may be included in more than one of your cohorts and 
may be included in the cohorts of more than one institution in the same 
fiscal year.
    (c) Identify the borrowers in a cohort who are in default. (1) 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for the purposes 
of this subpart a borrower in a cohort for a fiscal year is considered 
to be in default if--
    (i) Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower 
defaults on any FFELP loan that was used to include the borrower in the 
cohort or on any Federal Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a 
loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort (however, a 
borrower is not considered to be in default unless a claim for insurance 
has been paid on the loan by a guaranty agency or by us);
    (ii) Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower fails 
to make an installment payment, when due, on any Direct Loan Program 
loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any 
Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that 
was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's 
failure persists for 360 days (or for 270 days, if the borrower's first 
day of delinquency was before October 7, 1998);
    (iii) You are a proprietary, non-degree-granting institution, and 
before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower has been in 
repayment for 360 days, under the Direct Loan Program's income 
contingent repayment plan, on a loan used to include the borrower in 
your cohort (or that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower 
in your cohort), with scheduled payments that are less than 15 dollars 
per month and are less than the amount of interest accruing on the loan; 
or
    (iv) Before the end of the following fiscal year, you or your owner, 
agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or 
individual make a payment to prevent a borrower's default on a loan that 
is used to include the borrower in that cohort.
    (2) A borrower is not considered to be in default based on a loan 
that is, before the end of the fiscal year immediately following the 
fiscal year in which it entered repayment--
    (i) Rehabilitated under 34 CFR 682.405 or 34 CFR 685.211(e); or
    (ii) Repurchased by a lender because the claim for insurance was 
submitted or paid in error.
    (d) Calculate the cohort default rate. Except as provided in 
Sec. 668.184, if there are--
    (1) Thirty or more borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your 
cohort default rate is the percentage that is derived by dividing--
    (i) The number of borrowers in the cohort who are in default, as 
determined under paragraph (c) of this section; by

[[Page 550]]

    (ii) The number of borrowers in the cohort, as determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Fewer than 30 borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your 
cohort default rate is the percentage that is derived by dividing--
    (i) The total number of borrowers in that cohort and in the two most 
recent prior cohorts who are in default, as determined for each cohort 
under paragraph (c) of this section; by
    (ii) The total number of borrowers in that cohort and the two most 
recent prior cohorts, as determined for each cohort under paragraph (b) 
of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 668.184  Determining cohort default rates for institutions that have undergone a change in status.

    (a) General. (1) If you undergo a change in status identified in 
this section, your cohort default rate is determined under this section.
    (2) In determining cohort default rates under this section, the date 
of a merger, acquisition, or other change in status is the date the 
change occurs.
    (3) A change in status may affect your eligibility to participate in 
Title IV, HEA programs under Sec. 668.187 or Sec. 668.188.
    (4) If another institution's cohort default rate is applicable to 
you under this section, you may challenge, request an adjustment, or 
submit an appeal for the cohort default rate under the same requirements 
that would be applicable to the other institution under Secs. 668.185 
and 668.189.
    (b) Acquisition or merger of institutions. If your institution 
acquires, or was created by the merger of, one or more institutions that 
participated independently in the Title IV, HEA programs immediately 
before the acquisition or merger--
    (1) For the cohort default rates published before the date of the 
acquisition or merger, your cohort default rates are the same as those 
of your predecessor that had the highest total number of borrowers 
entering repayment in the two most recent cohorts used to calculate 
those cohort default rates; and
    (2) Beginning with the first cohort default rate published after the 
date of the acquisition or merger, your cohort default rates are 
determined by including the applicable borrowers from each institution 
involved in the acquisition or merger in the calculation under 
Sec. 668.183.
    (c) Acquisition of branches or locations. If you acquire a branch or 
a location from another institution participating in the Title IV, HEA 
programs--
    (1) The cohort default rates published for you before the date of 
the change apply to you and to the newly acquired branch or location;
    (2) Beginning with the first cohort default rate published after the 
date of the change, your cohort default rates for the next 3 fiscal 
years are determined by including the applicable borrowers from your 
institution and the other institution (including all of its locations) 
in the calculation under Sec. 668.183;
    (3) After the period described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
your cohort default rates do not include borrowers from the other 
institution in the calculation under Sec. 668.183; and
    (4) At all times, the cohort default rate for the institution from 
which you acquired the branch or location is not affected by this change 
in status.
    (d) Branches or locations becoming institutions. If you are a branch 
or location of an institution that is participating in the Title IV, HEA 
programs, and you become a separate, new institution for the purposes of 
participating in those programs--
    (1) The cohort default rates published before the date of the change 
for your former parent institution are also applicable to you;
    (2) Beginning with the first cohort default rate published after the

years are determined by including the applicable borrowers from your 
institution and your former parent institution (including all of its 
locations) in the calculation under Sec. 668.183; and
    (3) After the period described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section,

<R05>
Sec. 668.185  Draft cohort default rates and your ability to challenge before official cohort default rates are issued.

    (a) General. (1) We notify you of your draft cohort default rate 
before your official cohort default rate is calculated. Our notice 
includes the loan record detail report for the draft cohort default 
rate.
    (2) Regardless of the number of borrowers included in your cohort, 
your draft cohort default rate is always calculated using data for that 
fiscal year alone, using the method described in Sec. 668.183(d)(1).
    (3) Your draft cohort default rate and the loan record detail report 
are not considered public information and may not be otherwise 
voluntarily released by a data manager.
    (4) Any challenge you submit under this section and any response 
provided by a data manager must be in a format acceptable to us. This 
acceptable format is described in the ``Cohort Default Rate Guide'' that 
we provide to you. If your challenge does not comply with the 
requirements in the ``Cohort Default Rate Guide,'' we may deny your 
challenge.
    (b) Incorrect data challenges. (1) You may challenge the accuracy of 
the data included on the loan record detail report by sending a 
challenge to the relevant data manager, or data managers, within 45 days 
after you receive the data. Your challenge must include--
    (i) A description of the information in the loan record detail 
report that you believe is incorrect; and
    (ii) Documentation that supports your contention that the data are 
incorrect.
    (2) Within 30 days after receiving your challenge, the data manager 
must send you and us a response that--
    (i) Addresses each of your allegations of error; and
    (ii) Includes the documentation that supports the data manager's 
position.
    (3) If your data manager concludes that draft data in the loan 
record detail report are incorrect, and we agree, we use the corrected 
data to calculate your cohort default rate.
    (4) If you fail to challenge the accuracy of data under this 
section, you cannot contest the accuracy of those data in an uncorrected 
data adjustment, under Sec. 668.190, or in an erroneous data appeal, 
under Sec. 668.192.
    (c) Participation rate index challenges. (1)(i) You may challenge an 
anticipated loss of eligibility under Sec. 668.187(a)(1), based on one 
cohort default rate over 40 percent, if your participation rate index 
for that cohort's fiscal year is equal to or less than 0.06015.
    (ii) You may challenge an anticipated loss of eligibility under 
Sec. 668.187(a)(2), based on three cohort default rates of 25 percent or 
greater, if your participation rate index is equal to or less than 
0.0375 for any of those three cohorts' fiscal years.
    (2) For a participation rate index challenge, your participation 
rate index is calculated as described in Sec. 668.195(b), except that--
    (i) The draft cohort default rate is considered to be your most 
recent cohort default rate; and
    (ii) If the cohort used to calculate your draft cohort default rate 
included fewer than 30 borrowers, you may calculate your participation 
rate index for that fiscal year using either your most recent draft 
cohort default rate or the average rate that would be calculated for 
that fiscal year, using the method described in Sec. 668.183(d)(2).
    (3) You must send your participation rate index challenge, including 
all supporting documentation, to us within 45 days after you receive 
your draft cohort default rate.
    (4) We notify you of our determination on your participation rate 
index challenge before your official cohort default rate is published.
    (5) If we determine that you qualify for continued eligibility based 
on your participation rate index challenge, you will not lose 
eligibility under Sec. 668.187 when your next official cohort default 
rate is published. A successful challenge that is based on your draft 
cohort default rate does not excuse you from any other loss of 
eligibility. However, if your successful challenge of a loss of 
eligibility under paragraph

[[Page 552]]

(c)(1)(ii) of this section is based on a prior, official cohort default 
rate, and not on your draft cohort default rate, we also excuse you from 
any subsequent loss of eligibility, under Sec. 668.187(a)(2), that would 
be based on that official cohort default rate.

Sec. 668.186  Notice of your official cohort default rate.

    (a) We notify you of your cohort default rate after we calculate it. 
After we send our notice to you, we publish a list of cohort default 
rates for all institutions.
    (b) If your cohort default rate is 10 percent or more, we include a 
copy of the loan record detail report with the notice.
    (c) If your cohort default rate is less than 10 percent--
    (1) You may request a copy of any loan record detail report that 
lists loans included in your cohort default rate calculation; and
    (2) If you are requesting an adjustment or appealing under this 
subpart, your request for a copy of the loan record detail report or 
reports must be sent to us within 15 days after you receive the notice 
of your cohort default rate.

Sec. 668.187  Consequences of cohort default rates on your ability to participate in Title IV, HEA programs.

    (a) End of participation. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of 
this section, you lose your eligibility to participate in the FFEL and 
Direct Loan programs 30 days after you receive our notice that your most 
recent cohort default rate is greater than 40 percent.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, 
you lose your eligibility to participate in the FFEL, Direct Loan, and 
Federal Pell Grant programs 30 days after you receive our notice that 
your three most recent cohort default rates are each 25 percent or 
greater.
    (b) Length of period of ineligibility. Your loss of eligibility 
under this section continues--
    (1) For the remainder of the fiscal year in which we notify you that 
you are subject to a loss of eligibility; and
    (2) For the next 2 fiscal years.
    (c) Using a cohort default rate more than once. The use of a cohort 
default rate as a basis for a loss of eligibility under this section 
does not preclude its use as a basis for--
    (1) Any concurrent or subsequent loss of eligibility under this 
section; or
    (2) Any other action by us.
    (d) Special institutions. If you are a special institution that 
satisfies the requirements for continued eligibility under Sec. 668.198, 
you are not subject to any loss of eligibility under this section or to 
provisional certification under Sec. 668.16(m).
    (e) Continuing participation in Pell. If you are subject to a loss 
of eligibility under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, based on three 
cohort default rates of 25 percent or greater, you may continue to 
participate in the Federal Pell Grant Program if we determine that you--
    (1) Were ineligible to participate in the FFEL and Direct Loan 
programs before October 7, 1998, and your eligibility was not 
reinstated;
    (2) Requested in writing, before October 7, 1998, to withdraw your 
participation in the FFEL and Direct Loan programs, and you were not 
later reinstated; or
    (3) Have not certified an FFELP loan or originated a Direct Loan 
Program loan on or after July 7, 1998.
    (f) Requests for adjustments and appeals. (1) A loss of eligibility 
under this section does not take effect while your request for 
adjustment or appeal, as listed in Sec. 668.189(a), is pending, provided 
your request for adjustment or appeal is complete, timely, accurate, and 
in the required format.
    (2) Eligibility continued under paragraph (f)(1) of this section 
ends if we determine that none of the requests for adjustments and 
appeals you have submitted qualify you for continued eligibility under 
Sec. 668.189. Loss of eligibility takes effect on the date that you 
receive notice of our determination on

[[Page 553]]

your last pending request for adjustment or appeal.
    (3) You do not lose eligibility under this section if we determine 
that your request for adjustment or appeal meets all requirements of 
this subpart and qualifies you for continued eligibility under 
Sec. 668.189.
    (4) To avoid liabilities you might otherwise incur under paragraph 
(g) of this section, you may choose to suspend your participation in the 
FFEL and Direct Loan programs during the adjustment or appeal process.
    (g) Liabilities during the adjustment or appeal process. If you 
continued to participate in the FFEL or Direct Loan Program under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and we determine that none of your 
requests for adjustments or appeals qualify you for continued 
eligibility--
    (1) For any FFEL or Direct Loan Program loan that you certified and 
delivered or originated and disbursed more than 30 days after you 
received the notice of your cohort default rate, we estimate the amount 
of interest, special allowance, reinsurance, and any related or similar 
payments we make or are obligated to make on those loans;
    (2) We exclude from this estimate any amount attributable to funds 
that you delivered or disbursed more than 45 days after you submitted 
your completed appeal to us;
    (3) We notify you of the estimated amount; and
    (4) Within 45 days after you receive our notice of the estimated 
amount, you must pay us that amount, unless--
    (i) You file an appeal under the procedures established in subpart H 
of this part (for the purposes of subpart H of this part, our notice of 
the estimate is considered to be a final program review determination); 
or
    (ii) We permit a longer repayment period.
    (h) Regaining eligibility. If you lose your eligibility to 
participate in a program under this section, you may not participate in 
that program until--
    (1) The period described in paragraph (b) of this section has ended;
    (2) You pay any amount owed to us under this section or are meeting 
that obligation under an agreement acceptable to us;
    (3) You submit a new application for participation in the program;
    (4) We determine that you meet all of the participation requirements 
in effect at the time of your application; and
    (5) You and we enter into a new program participation agreement.

Sec. 668.188  Preventing evasion of the consequences of cohort default rates.

    (a) General. Unless you are a special institution complying with 
Sec. 668.198, you are subject to a loss of eligibility that has already 
been imposed against another institution under Sec. 668.187 if--
    (1) You and the ineligible institution are both parties to a 
transaction that results in a change of ownership, a change in control, 
a merger, a consolidation, an acquisition, a change of name, a change of 
address, any change that results in a location becoming a freestanding 
institution, a purchase or sale, a transfer of assets, an assignment, a 
change of identification number, a contract for services, an addition or 
closure of one or more locations or branches or educational programs, or 
any other change in whole or in part in institutional structure or 
identity;
    (2) Following the change described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, you offer an educational program at substantially the same 
address at which the ineligible institution had offered an educational 
program before the change; and
    (3) There is a commonality of ownership or management between you 
and the ineligible institution, as the ineligible institution existed 
before the change.
    (b) Commonality of ownership or management. For the purposes of this 
section, a commonality of ownership or management exists if, at each 
institution, the same person (as defined in 34 CFR 600.31) or members of 
that person's family, directly or indirectly--
    (1) Holds or held a managerial role; or

[[Page 554]]

    (2) Has or had the ability to affect substantially the institution's 
actions, within the meaning of 34 CFR 600.21.
    (c) Teach-outs. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a 
commonality of management does not exist if you are conducting a teach-
out under a teach-out agreement as defined in 34 CFR 602.3 and 
administered in accordance with 34 CFR 602.24(c), and--
    (1)(i) Within 60 days after the change described in this section, 
you send us the names of the managers for each facility undergoing the 
teach-out as it existed before the change and for each facility as it 
exists after you believe that the commonality of management has ended; 
and
    (ii) We determine that the commonality of management, as described 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, has ended; or
    (2)(i) Within 30 days after you receive our notice that we have 
denied your submission under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, you 
make the management changes we request and send us a list of the names 
of the managers for each facility undergoing the teach-out as it exists 
after you make those changes; and
    (ii) We determine that the commonality of management, as described 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, has ended.
    (d) Initial determination. We encourage you to contact us before 
undergoing a change described in this section. If you write to us, 
providing the information we request, we will provide a written initial 
determination of the anticipated change's effect on your eligibility.
    (e) Notice of accountability. (1) We notify you in writing if, in 
response to your notice or application filed under 34 CFR 600.20 or 
600.21, we determine that you are subject to a loss of eligibility, 
under paragraph (a) of this section, that has been imposed against 
another institution.
    (2) Our notice also advises you of the scope and duration of your 
loss of eligibility. The loss of eligibility applies to all of your 
locations from the date you receive our notice until the expiration of 
the period of ineligibility applicable to the other institution.
    (3) If you are subject to a loss of eligibility under this section 
that has already been imposed against another institution, you may only 
request an adjustment or submit an appeal for the loss of eligibility 
under the same requirements that would be applicable to the other 
institution under Sec. 668.189.

manager is correct unless you provide substantial evidence that shows 
the information is not correct; and
    (ii) If we determine that a data manager did not provide the

Sec. 668.193  Loan servicing appeals.

    (a) Eligibility. Except as provided in Sec. 668.189(b), you may 
appeal, on the basis of improper loan servicing or collection, the 
calculation of--
    (1) Your most recent cohort default rate; or
    (2) Any cohort default rate upon which a loss of eligibility under 
Sec. 668.187 is based.
    (b) Improper loan servicing. For the purposes of this section, a 
default is considered to have been due to improper loan servicing or 
collection only if the borrower did not make a payment on the loan and 
you prove that the FFEL Program lender or the Direct Loan Servicer, as 
defined in 34 CFR 685.102, failed to perform one or more of the 
following activities, if that activity applies to the loan:
    (1) Send at least one letter (other than the final demand letter) 
urging the borrower to make payments on the loan;
    (2) Attempt at least one phone call to the borrower;
    (3) Send a final demand letter to the borrower;
    (4) For a Direct Loan Program loan only, document that skip tracing 
was performed if the Direct Loan Servicer determined that it did not 
have the borrower's current address; and
    (5) For an FFELP loan only--
    (i) Submit a request for preclaims or default aversion assistance to 
the guaranty agency; and
    (ii) Submit a certification or other documentation that skip tracing 
was performed to the guaranty agency.
    (c) Deadlines for submitting an appeal. (1) If the loan record 
detail report was not included with your official cohort

[[Page 558]]

default rate notice, you must request it within 15 days after you 
receive the notice of your official cohort default rate.
    (2) You must send a request for loan servicing records to the 
relevant data manager, or data managers, and to us within 15 days after 
you receive your loan record detail report from us. If the data manager 
is a guaranty agency, your request must include a copy of the loan 
record detail report.
    (3) Within 20 days after receiving your request for loan servicing 
records, the data manager must--
    (i) Send you and us a list of the borrowers in your representative 
sample, as described in paragraph (d) of this section (the list must be 
in social security number order, and it must include the number of 
defaulted loans included in the cohort for each listed borrower);
    (ii) Send you and us a description of how your representative sample 
was chosen; and
    (iii) Either send you copies of the loan servicing records for the 
borrowers in your representative sample and send us a copy of its cover 
letter indicating that the records were sent, or send you and us a 
notice of the amount of its fee for providing copies of the loan 
servicing records.
    (4) The data manager may charge you a reasonable fee for providing 
copies of loan servicing records, but it may not charge more than $10 
per borrower file. If a data manager charges a fee, it is not required 
to send the documents to you until it receives your payment of the fee.
    (5) If the data manager charges a fee for providing copies of loan 
servicing records, you must send payment in full to the data manager 
within 15 days after you receive the notice of the fee.
    (6) If the data manager charges a fee for providing copies of loan 
servicing records, and--
    (i) You pay the fee in full and on time, the data manager must send 
you, within 20 days after it receives your payment, a copy of all loan 
servicing records for each loan in your representative sample (the 
copies are provided to you in hard copy format unless the data manager 
and you agree that another format may be used), and it must send us a 
copy of its cover letter indicating that the records were sent; or
    (ii) You do not pay the fee in full and on time, the data manager 
must notify you and us of your failure to pay the fee and that you have 
waived your right to challenge the calculation of your cohort default 
rate based on the data manager's records. We accept that determination 
unless you prove that it is incorrect.
    (7) Within 15 days after receiving a guaranty agency's notice that 
we hold an FFELP loan about which you are inquiring, you must send us 
your request for the loan servicing records for that loan. We respond to 
your request under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (8) Within 15 days after receiving incomplete or illegible records, 
you must send a request for replacement records to the data manager and 
us.
    (9) Within 20 days after receiving your request for replacement 
records, the data manager must either--
    (i) Replace the missing or illegible records; or
    (ii) Notify you and us that no additional or improved copies are 
available.
    (10) You must send your appeal to us, including all supporting 
documentation--
    (i) Within 30 days after you receive the final data manager's 
response to your request for loan servicing records; or
    (ii) If you are also requesting a new data adjustment or filing an 
erroneous data appeal, by the latest of the filing dates required in 
paragraph (c)(10)(i) of this section or in Sec. 668.191(b)(7)(i) or 
Sec. 668.192(b)(6)(i).
    (d) Representative sample of records. (1) To select a representative 
sample of records, the data manager first identifies all of the 
borrowers for whom it is responsible and who had loans that were 
considered to be in default in the calculation of the cohort default 
rate you are appealing. However, for the purposes of this paragraph, the 
data manager does not identify a borrower as defaulted due to repayment 
under the Direct Loan Program's income contingent repayment plan, under 
Sec. 668.183(c)(1)(iii).
    (2) From the group of borrowers identified under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, the data manager identifies a sample that is large enough 
to derive an estimate, acceptable at a 95 percent

[[Page 559]]

confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval, for 
use in determining the number of borrowers who should be excluded from 
the calculation of the cohort default rate due to improper loan 
servicing or collection.
    (e) Loan servicing records. Loan servicing records are the 
collection and payment history records--
    (1) Provided to the guaranty agency by the lender and used by the 
guaranty agency in determining whether to pay a claim on a defaulted 
loan; or
    (2) Maintained by our Direct Loan Servicer that are used in 
determining your cohort default rate.
    (f) Determination. (1) We determine the number of loans, included in 
your representative sample of loan servicing records, that defaulted due 
to improper loan servicing or collection, as described in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (2) Based on our determination, we use a statistically valid 
methodology to exclude the corresponding percentage of borrowers from 
both the numerator and denominator of the calculation of your cohort 
default rate.
    (3) Our recalculation of your cohort default rate does not affect 
the number of borrowers who are considered to be in default due to 
payments made under the Direct Loan Program's income contingent 
repayment plan, under the criteria in Sec. 668.183(c)(1)(iii).

auditor's opinion certifies that your low income rate is two-thirds or 
more and--
    (1) You offer an associate, baccalaureate, graduate, or professional 
degree, and your completion rate is 70 percent or more; or
    (2) You do not offer an associate, baccalaureate, graduate, or 
professional degree, and your placement rate is 44 percent or more.
    (b) Low income rate. (1) Your low income rate is the percentage of

under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, have an expected family 
contribution, as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, that is equal to or less than 
the largest expected family contribution that would allow a student to 
receive one-half of the maximum Federal Pell Grant award, regardless of 
the student's enrollment status or cost of attendance; or
    (ii) For a calendar year that overlaps the 12-month period selected 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, have an adjusted gross income 
that, when added to the adjusted gross income of the student's parents 
(if the student is a dependent student) or spouse (if the student is a 
married independent student), is less than the amount listed in the 
Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines for the size 
of the student's family unit.
    (2) The students who are used to determine your low income rate 
include only students who were enrolled on at least a half-time basis in 
an eligible program at your institution during any part of a 12-month 
period that ended during the 6 months immediately preceding the cohort's 
fiscal year.
    (c) Completion rate. (1) Your completion rate is the percentage of 
your students, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, who--

    (ii) Transferred from your institution to a higher level educational 
program;
    (iii) Remained enrolled and are making satisfactory progress toward 
completion of their educational programs at the end of the same 12-month

12-

[[Page 560]]

month period used to calculate the low income rate.
    (d) Placement rate. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, your placement rate is the percentage of your students, as 
described in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, who--
    (i) Are employed, in an occupation for which you provided training, 
on the date following 1 year after their last date of attendance at your 
institution;
    (ii) Were employed for at least 13 weeks, in an occupation for which 
you provided training, between the date they enrolled at your 
institution and the first date that is more than a year after their last 
date of attendance at your institution; or
    (iii) Entered active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States 
within 1 year after their last date of attendance at your institution.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a former student is not 
considered to have been employed based on any employment by your 
institution.
    (3) The students who are used to determine your placement rate 
include only former students who--
    (i) Were initially enrolled in an eligible program on at least a 
half-time basis;
    (ii) Were originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to 
complete their educational programs during the same 12-month period used 
to calculate the low income rate; and
    (iii) Remained in the program beyond the point at which a student 
would have received a 100 percent tuition refund from you.
    (4) A student is not included in the calculation of your placement 
rate if that student, on the date that is 1 year after the student's 
originally scheduled completion date, remains enrolled in the same 
program and is making satisfactory progress.
    (e) Scheduled to complete. In calculating a completion or placement 
rate under this section, the date on which a student is originally 
scheduled to complete a program is based on--
    (1) For a student who is initially enrolled full-time, the amount of 
time specified in your enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials 
for completion of the program by a full-time student; or
    (2) For a student who is initially enrolled less than full-time, the 
amount of time that it would take the student to complete the program if 
the student remained at that level of enrollment throughout the program.
    (f) Deadline for submitting an appeal. (1) Within 30 days after you 
receive the notice of your loss of eligibility, you must send us your 
management's written assertion, as described in the Cohort Default Rate 
Guide.

eligibility, you must send us the independent auditor's opinion 
described in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) Independent auditor's opinion. (1) The independent auditor's 
opinion must state whether your management's written assertion, as you 
provided it to the auditor and to us, meets the requirements for an 
economically disadvantaged appeal and is fairly stated in all material 
respects.
    (2) The engagement that forms the basis of the independent auditor's 
opinion must be an examination-level compliance attestation engagement 
performed in accordance with--
    (i) The American Institute of Certified Public Accountant's (AICPA) 
Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements, Compliance 
Attestation (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1, AT sec. 500), as

    (ii) Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General 
of the United States.
    (h) Determination. You do not lose eligibility under Sec. 668.187 
if--
    (1) Your independent auditor's opinion agrees that you meet the 
requirements for an economically disadvantaged appeal; and
    (2) We determine that the independent auditor's opinion and your 
management's written assertion--
    (i) Meet the requirements for an economically disadvantaged appeal; 
and
    (ii) Are not contradicted or otherwise proven to be incorrect by 
information we maintain, to an extent that would

Sec. 668.195  Participation rate index appeals.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) You may appeal a notice of a loss of 
eligibility under Sec. 668.187(a)(1), based on one cohort default rate 
over 40 percent, if your participation rate index for that cohort's 
fiscal year is equal to or less than 0.06015.
    (2) You may appeal a notice of a loss of eligibility under 
Sec. 668.187(a)(2), based on three cohort default rates of 25 percent or 
greater, if your participation rate index is equal to or less than 
0.0375 for any of those three cohorts' fiscal years.
    (b) Calculating your participation rate index. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, your participation rate 
index for a fiscal year is determined by multiplying your cohort default 
rate for that fiscal year by the percentage that is derived by dividing-
-
    (i) The number of students who received an FFELP or a Direct Loan 
Program loan to attend your institution during a period of enrollment, 
as defined in 34 CFR 682.200 or 685.102, that overlaps any part of a 12-
month period that ended during the 6 months immediately preceding the 
cohort's fiscal year, by
    (ii) The number of regular students who were enrolled at your 
institution on at least a half-time basis during any part of the same 
12-month period.
    (2) If your cohort default rate for a fiscal year is calculated as 
an average rate under Sec. 668.183(d)(2), you may calculate your 
participation rate index for that fiscal year using either that average 
rate or the cohort default rate that would be calculated for the fiscal 
year alone using the method described in Sec. 668.183(d)(1).
    (c) Deadline for submitting an appeal. You must send us your appeal 
under this section, including all supporting documentation, within 30 
days after you receive the notice of your loss of eligibility.
    (d) Determination. (1) You do not lose eligibility under 
Sec. 668.187 if we determine that you meet the requirements for a 
participation rate index appeal.
    (2) If we determine that your participation rate index for a fiscal 
year is equal to or less than 0.0375, under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, we also excuse you from any subsequent loss of eligibility 
under Sec. 668.187(a)(2) that would be based on the official cohort 
default rate for that fiscal year.

Sec. 668.196  Average rates appeals.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) You may appeal a notice of a loss of 
eligibility under Sec. 668.187(a)(1), based on one cohort default rate 
over 40 percent, if that cohort default rate is calculated as an average 
rate under Sec. 668.183(d)(2).
    (2) You may appeal a notice of a loss of eligibility under 
Sec. 668.187(a)(2), based on three cohort default rates of 25 percent or 
greater, if at least two of those cohort default rates--
    (i) Are calculated as average rates under Sec. 668.183(d)(2); and
    (ii) Would be less than 25 percent if calculated for the fiscal year 
alone using the method described in Sec. 668.183(d)(1).
    (b) Deadline for submitting an appeal. (1) Before notifying you of 
your official cohort default rate, we make an initial determination 
about whether you qualify for an average rates appeal. If we determine 
that you qualify, we notify you of that determination at the same time 
that we notify you of your official cohort default rate.
    (2) If you disagree with our initial determination, you must send us 
your average rates appeal, including all supporting documentation, 
within 30 days after you receive the notice of your loss of eligibility.
    (c) Determination. You do not lose eligibility under Sec. 668.187 if 
we determine that you meet the requirements for an average rates appeal.

    (a) Eligibility. You may appeal a notice of a loss of eligibility 
under Sec. 668.187 if 30 or fewer borrowers, in total, are included in 
the 3 most recent cohorts of borrowers used to calculate your cohort 
default rates.
    (b) Deadline for submitting an appeal. (1) Before notifying you of 
your official cohort default rate, we make an initial determination 
about whether you qualify for a thirty-or-fewer borrowers appeal. If we 
determine that you qualify, we notify you of that determination at the 
same time that we notify you of your official cohort default rate.
    (2) If you disagree with our initial determination, you must send us 
your thirty-or-fewer borrowers appeal, including all supporting 
documentation, within 30 days after you receive the notice of your loss

Sec. 668.198  Relief from the consequences of cohort default rates for special institutions.

    (a) Eligibility. You are only eligible for relief from the 
consequences of cohort default rates under this section if you are a--
    (1) Historically black college or university as defined in section 
322(2) of the HEA;
    (2) Tribally controlled community college as defined in section 
2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 
1978; or
    (3) Navajo community college under the Navajo Community College Act.
    (b) Applicability of requirements. We may determine that the loss of 
eligibility provisions in Sec. 668.187 and the prohibition against full 
certification in Sec. 668.16(m) do not apply to you for each 1-year 
period beginning on July 1 of 1999, 2000, or 2001, if you meet the 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section and you send us--
    (1) By July 1 of the first 1-year period that begins after you 
receive our notice of a loss of eligibility under Sec. 668.187--
    (i) A default management plan; and
    (ii) A certification that you have engaged an independent third 
party, as described in this section; and
    (2) By July 1 of each subsequent 1-year period--
    (i) Evidence that you have implemented your default management plan 
during the preceding 1-year period;
    (ii) Evidence that you have made substantial improvement in the 
preceding 1-year period in your cohort default rate; and
    (iii) A certification that you continue to engage an independent 
third party, as described in this section.
    (c) Default management plan. (1) Your default management plan must 
provide reasonable assurance that you will, no later than July 1, 2002, 
have a cohort default rate that is less than 25 percent. Measures that 
you must take to provide this assurance include but are not limited to--
    (i) Establishing a default management team by engaging your chief 
executive officer and relevant senior executive officials and enlisting 
the support of representatives from offices other than the financial aid 
office;
    (ii) Identifying and allocating the personnel, administrative, and 
financial resources appropriate to implement the default management 
plan;
    (iii) Defining the roles and responsibilities of the independent 
third party;
    (iv) Defining evaluation methods and establishing a data collection 
system for measuring and verifying relevant default management 
statistics, including a statistical analysis of the borrowers who 
default on their loans;
    (v) Establishing annual targets for reductions in your cohort 
default rate; and
    (vi) Establishing a process to ensure the accuracy of your cohort 
default rate.
    (2) We will determine whether your default management plan is 
acceptable, after considering your history, resources, dollars in 
default, and targets for default reduction in making this determination.

[[Page 563]]

    (3) If we determine that your proposed default management plan is 
unacceptable, you must consult with us to develop a revised plan and 
submit the revised plan to us within 30 days after you receive our 
notice that your proposed plan is unacceptable.
    (4) If we determine, based on the evidence you submit under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that your default management plan is 
no longer acceptable, you must develop a revised plan in consultation 
with us and submit the revised plan to us within 60 days after you 
receive our notice that your plan is no longer acceptable.
    (5) A sample default management plan is provided in appendix B to 
this subpart. The sample is included to illustrate components of an 
acceptable default management plan. Since institutions' family income 
profiles, student borrowing patterns, histories, resources, dollars in 
default, and targets for default reduction are different, you must 
consider your own, individual circumstances in developing and submitting 
your plan.
    (d) Independent third party. (1) An independent third party may be 
any individual or entity that--
    (i) Provides technical assistance in developing and implementing 
your default management plan; and
    (ii) Is not substantially controlled by a person who also exercises 
substantial control over your institution.
    (2) An independent third party need not be paid by you for its 
services.
    (3) The services of a lender, guaranty agency, or secondary market 
as an independent third party under this section are not considered to 
be inducements under 34 CFR 682.200 or 682.401(e).
    (e) Substantial improvement. (1) For the purposes of this section, 
your substantial improvement is determined based on--
    (i) A reduction in your most recent draft or official cohort default 
rate;
    (ii) An increase in the percentage of delinquent borrowers who avoid 
default by using deferments, forbearances, and job placement assistance;
    (iii) An increase in the academic persistence of student borrowers;
    (iv) An increase in the percentage of students pursuing graduate or 
professional study;
    (v) An increase in the percentage of borrowers for whom a current 
address is known;
    (vi) An increase in the percentage of delinquent borrowers that you 
contacted;
    (vii) The implementation of alternative financial aid award policies 
and development of financial resources that reduce the need for student 
borrowing; or (viii) An increase in the percentage of accurate and 
timely enrollment status changes that you submitted to the National 
Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) on the Student Status Confirmation 
Report (SSCR).
    (2) When making a determination of your substantial improvement, we 
consider your performance in light of--
    (i) Your history, resources, dollars in default, and targets for 
default reduction;
    (ii) Your level of effort in meeting the terms of your approved 
default management plan during the previous 1-year period; and
    (iii) Any other mitigating circumstance at your institution during 
the 1-year period.
    (f) Determination. (1) If we determine that you are in compliance 
with this section, the provisions of Secs. 668.187 and 668.16(m) do not 
apply to you for that 1-year period, beginning on July 1 of 1999, 2000, 
or 2001.
    (2) If we determine that you are not in compliance with this 
section, you are subject to the provisions of Secs. 668.187 and 
668.16(m). You lose your eligibility to participate in the FFEL, Direct 
Loan, and Federal Pell Grant programs on the date you receive our notice 
of the determination.

   Appendix A to Subpart M of Part 668--Summaries of Eligibility and 
    Submission Requirements for Challenges, Adjustments, and Appeals

                  I. Summary of Submission Eligibility

    Some types of appeals may be submitted only if you are subject to a 
loss of eligibility

[[Page 564]]

under Sec. 668.187 or to provisional certification under Sec. 668.16(m). 
These types of appeals are identified in the following table. Submission 
deadlines are described in the paragraphs and sections that are cited in 
the table. For example, although you may submit an uncorrected data 
adjustment, new data adjustment, or loan servicing appeal if you are 
subject to provisional certification, the deadlines for those 
submissions are based on the date you receive your cohort default rate, 
not the date you receive the notice of your provisional certification.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01NO00.006

                   II. Summary of Submission Deadlines

    1. General. The deadlines you must meet when submitting a challenge, 
a request for adjustment, or an appeal are summarized in the following 
table. The full, official requirements for these deadlines are in 
Sec. 668.189 and in the sections and paragraphs cited in the table.
    2. Timeframes. The timeframes provided in the table (``30 Days'', 
``15 Days'', etc.) identify the number of calendar days within which 
that action must be performed. Timeframes begin on the date that the 
previous action (connected to that timeframe with an arrowed line) is 
completed:
    (i) For your first action (and for both actions, during an 
economically disadvantaged appeal), the timeframe begins on the date 
that you receive your draft cohort default rate, official cohort default 
rate, notice of loss of eligibility, or notice of provisional 
certification.
    (ii) For all other actions, the timeframe begins on the date you 
receive the response to your pending request. If you are waiting for 
responses from more than one data manager, the timeframe begins on the 
date that you receive the final response from the last data manager.
    3. Dotted borders. Some actions identified in the table are required 
only in certain circumstances. For example, if we don't send you a loan 
record detail report, because your cohort default rate is less than 10 
percent, you must request one before you can request an adjustment or 
appeal. Timeframes for actions that aren't always required are 
identified in the table by dotted borders:
    (i) If you are required to perform that action, the timeframes begin 
on the same dates that they would if the timeframe borders were not 
dotted.
    (ii) If you are not required to perform that action, the timeframe 
for your next required action is determined as if the timeframes with 
the dotted borders were not there. The timeframe for your next required 
action begins on the date that the last required action was completed.

Appendix B to Subpart M of Part 668--Sample Default Management Plan for 
      Special Institutions to Use When Complying With Sec. 668.198

    This appendix is provided as a sample plan for those institutions 
developing a default management plan in accordance with Sec. 668.198. It 
describes some measures you may find helpful in reducing the number of 
students that default on federally funded loans. These are not the only 
measures you could

[[Page 566]]

implement when developing a default management plan. In developing a 
default management plan, you must consider your history, resources, 
dollars in default, and targets for default reduction to determine which 
activities will result in the most benefit to your students and to you.

     I. Core Default Reduction Strategies (From Sec. 668.198(c)(1))

    1. Establish a default management team by engaging your chief 
executive officer and relevant senior executive officials and enlisting 
the support of representatives from offices other than the financial aid 
office.
    2. Identify and allocate the personnel, administrative, and 
financial resources appropriate to implement the default management 
plan.
    3. Define the roles and responsibilities of the independent third 
party.
    4. Define evaluation methods and establish a data collection system 
for measuring and verifying relevant default management statistics, 
including a statistical analysis of the borrowers who default on their 
loans.
    5. Establish annual targets for reductions in your rate.
    6. Establish a process to ensure the accuracy of your rate.

               II. Additional Default Reduction Strategies

    1. Enhance the borrower's understanding of his or her loan repayment 
responsibilities through counseling and debt management activities.
    2. Enhance the enrollment retention and academic persistence of 
borrowers through counseling and academic assistance.
    3. Maintain contact with the borrower after he or she leaves your 
institution by using activities such as skip tracing to locate the 
borrower.
    4. Track the borrower's delinquency status by obtaining reports from 
data managers and FFEL Program lenders.
    5. Enhance student loan repayments through counseling the borrower 
on loan repayment options and facilitating contact between the borrower 
and the data manager or FFEL Program lender.
    6. Assist a borrower who is experiencing difficulty in finding 
employment through career counseling, job placement assistance, and 
facilitating unemployment deferments.
    7. Identify and implement alternative financial aid award policies 
and develop alternative financial resources that will reduce the need 
for student borrowing in the first 2 years of academic study.
    8. Familiarize the parent, or other adult relative or guardian, with 
the student's debt profile, repayment obligations, and loan status by 
increasing, whenever possible, the communication and contact with the 
parent or adult relative or guardian.

 III. Defining the Roles and Responsibilities of Independent Third Party

    1. Specifically define the role of the independent third party.
    2. Specify the scope of work to be performed by the independent 
third party.
    3. Tie the receipt of payments, if required, to the performance of 
specific tasks.
    4. Assure that all the required work is satisfactorily completed.

                  IV. Statistics for Measuring Progress

    1. The number of students enrolled at your institution during each 
fiscal year.
    2. The average amount borrowed by a student each fiscal year.
    3. The number of borrowers scheduled to enter repayment each fiscal 
year.
    4. The number of enrolled borrowers who received default prevention 
counseling services each fiscal year.
    5. The average number of contacts that you or your agent had with a 
borrower who was in deferment or forbearance or in repayment status 
during each fiscal year.
    6. The number of borrowers at least 60 days delinquent each fiscal 
year.
    7. The number of borrowers who defaulted in each fiscal year.
    8. The type, frequency, and results of activities performed in 
accordance with the default management plan.

    (b) The application for the Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, and FSEOG 
programs must be on a form approved by the Secretary and must contain 
the information needed by the Secretary to determine the institution's 
allocation or reallocation of funds under sections 462, 442, and 413D of 
the HEA, respectively.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1070b-3 and 1087bb; 42 U.S.C. 2752)


<R05>
Sec. 673.4  Allocation and reallocation.

    (a) Allocation and reallocation of Federal Perkins Loan funds. (1) 
The Secretary allocates Federal capital contributions to institutions 
participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program in accordance with 
section 462 of the HEA.
    (2) The Secretary reallocates Federal capital contributions to 
institutions participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program by--
    (i) Reallocating 80 percent of the total funds available in 
accordance with section 462(j) of the HEA; and
    (ii) Reallocating 20 percent of the total funds available in a 
manner that best carries out the purposes of the Federal Perkins Loan 
Program.
    (b) Allocation and reallocation of FWS funds. The Secretary 
allocates and reallocates funds to institutions participating in the FWS 
Program in accordance with section 442 of the HEA.
    (c) Allocation and reallocation of FSEOG funds. (1) The Secretary 
allocates funds to institutions participating in the FSEOG program in

FSEOG Program.
    (d) General allocation and reallocation--(1) Categories. As used in 
section 462 (Federal Perkins Loan Program), section 442 (FWS Program), 
and section 413D (FSEOG Program) of the HEA, ``Eligible institutions 
offering comparable programs of instruction'' means institutions that 
are being compared with the applicant institution and that fall within 
one of the following six categories:
    (i) Cosmetology.
    (ii) Business.

[[Page 570]]

    (iii) Trade/Technical.
    (iv) Art Schools.
    (v) Other Proprietary Institutions.
    (vi) Non-Proprietary Institutions.
    (2) Payments to institutions. The Secretary allocates funds for a 
specific period of time. The Secretary provides an institution its 
allocation in accordance with the payment methods described in 34 CFR 
668.162.
    (3) Unexpended funds. (i) If an institution returns more than 10 
percent of its Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG allocation for an 
award year, the Secretary reduces the institution's allocation for that 
program for the second succeeding award year by the dollar amount 
returned.
    (ii) The Secretary may waive the provision of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of 
this section for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that 
enforcement would be contrary to the interests of the program.
    (iii) The Secretary considers enforcement of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of 
this section to be contrary to the interest of the program only if the 
institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation due to 
circumstances beyond the institution's control that are not expected to 
recur.
    (e) Anticipated collections of Federal Perkins Loan funds. (1) For 
the purposes of calculating an institution's share of any excess 
allocation of Federal Perkins Loan funds, an institution's anticipated 
collections are equal to the amount that was collected by the 
institution during the second year preceding the beginning of the award 
period multiplied by 1.21.
    (2) The Secretary may waive the provision of paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section for any institution that has a cohort default rate that 
does not exceed 7.5 percent.
    (f) Authority to expend FWS funds. Except as specifically provided 
in 34 CFR 675.18 (b), (c), and (f), an institution may not use funds 
allocated or reallocated for an award year--
    (1) To meet FWS wage obligations incurred with regard to an award of 
FWS employment made for any other award year; or
    (2) To satisfy any other obligation incurred after the end of the 
designated award year.
    (g) Authority to expend FSEOG funds. Except as specifically provided 
in 34 CFR 668.164(g), an institution shall not use funds allocated or 
reallocated for an award year--
    (1) To make FSEOG disbursements to students in any other award year; 
or
    (2) To satisfy any other obligation incurred after the end of the 
designated award year.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1070b-3 and 1087bb, 42 U.S.C. 2752)


<R05>
Sec. 673.5  Overaward.

    (a) Overaward prohibited--(1) Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG 
Programs. An institution may only award or disburse a Federal Perkins 
loan or an FSEOG to a student if that loan or the FSEOG, combined with 
the other resources the student receives, does not exceed the student's 
financial need.
    (2) FWS Program. An institution may only award FWS employment to a 
student if the award, combined with the other resources the student 
receives, does not exceed the student's financial need.
    (b) Awarding and disbursement. (1) When awarding and disbursing a 
Federal Perkins loan or an FSEOG or awarding FWS employment to a 
student, the institution shall take into account those resources it--
    (i) Can reasonably anticipate at the time it awards Federal Perkins 
Loan funds, an FSEOG, or FWS funds to the student;
    (ii) Makes available to its students; or
    (iii) Otherwise knows about.
    (2) If a student receives resources at any time during the award 
period that were not considered in calculating the Federal Perkins Loan 
amount or the FWS or FSEOG award, and the total resources including the 
loan, the FSEOG, or the prospective FWS wages exceed the student's need, 
the overaward is the amount that exceeds need.
    (c) Resources. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), 
and (c)(4) of this section, the Secretary considers that ``resources'' 
include, but are not limited to, any--
    (i) Funds a student is entitled to receive from a Federal Pell 
Grant;

[[Page 571]]

    (ii) William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans;
    (iii) Federal Family Education Loans;
    (iv) Long-term loans, including Federal Perkins loans made by the 
institution;
    (v) Grants, including FSEOGs, State grants, and ROTC subsistence 
allowances;
    (vi) Scholarships, including athletic scholarships and ROTC 
scholarships;
    (vii) Waivers of tuition and fees;
    (viii) Fellowships or assistantships;
    (ix) Veterans educational benefits paid under Chapters 30, 31, 32, 
and 35 of title 38 of the United States Code;
    (x) National service education awards or post-service benefits paid 
for the cost of attendance under title I of the National and Community 
Service Act of 1990 (AmeriCorps);
    (xi) Net earnings from need-based employment; and
    (xii) Insurance programs for the student's education.
    (2) The Secretary does not consider as a resource--
    (i) Any portion of the resources described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section that are included in the calculation of the student's 
expected family contribution (EFC); and
    (ii) Earnings from non-need-based employment.
    (3) The institution may treat a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, a Federal 
PLUS Loan, a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan, a Federal 
Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, or a State-sponsored or private loan as a 
substitute for a student's EFC. However, if the sum of the loan amounts 
received exceeds the student's EFC, the excess is a resource.
    (4) The institution may exclude as a resource any portion of a 
Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan (Direct Subsidized Loan) and 
subsidized Federal Stafford Loan that is equal to or less than the 
amount of a student's veterans education benefits paid under Chapter 30 
of title 38 of the United States Code (Montgomery GI Bill) and national 
service education awards or post service benefits paid for the cost of 
attendance under title I of the National and Community Service Act of 
1990 (AmeriCorps).
    (d) Treatment of resources in excess of need--General. An 
institution shall take the following steps if it learns that a student 
has received additional resources not included in the calculation of 
Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG eligibility that would result in the 
student's total resources exceeding his or her financial need by more 
than $300:
    (1) The institution shall decide whether the student has increased 
financial need that was unanticipated when it awarded financial aid to 
the student. If the student demonstrates increased financial need and 
the total resources do not exceed this increased need by more than $300, 
no further action is necessary.
    (2) If the student's total resources still exceed his or her need by 
more than $300, as recalculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, the institution shall cancel any undisbursed loan or grant 
(other than a Federal Pell Grant).
    (3) Federal Perkins loan and FSEOG overpayment. If the student's 
total resources still exceed his or her need by more than $300, after 
the institution takes the steps required in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of 
this section, the institution shall consider the amount by which the 
resources exceed the student's financial need by more than $300 as an 
overpayment.
    (e) Termination of FWS employment. (1) An institution may fund a 
student's FWS employment with FWS funds only until the amount of the FWS 
award has been earned or until the student's financial need, as 
recalculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, is met.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, an institution may provide additional FWS funding to a student 
whose need has been met until that student's cumulative earnings from 
all need-based employment occurring subsequent to the time his or her 
financial need has been met exceed $300.
    (f) Liability for and recovery of Federal Perkins loans and FSEOG 
overpayments. (1) A student is liable for any Federal Perkins loan or 
FSEOG overpayment made to him or her.

[[Page 572]]

    (2) The institution is also liable for a Federal Perkins loan or 
FSEOG overpayment if the overpayment occurred because the institution 
failed to follow the procedures in this part, 34 CFR part 668, 34 CFR 
part 674, or 34 CFR part 676. The institution shall restore an amount 
equal to the overpayment and any administrative cost allowance claimed 
on that amount to its loan fund for a Federal Perkins loan overpayment 
or to its FSEOG account for an FSEOG overpayment if it cannot collect 
the overpayment from the student.
    (3) If an institution makes a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG 
overpayment for which it is not liable, it shall help the Secretary 
recover the overpayment by promptly attempting to recover the 
overpayment by sending a written notice to the student requesting 
repayment of the overawarded funds. The notice must state that failure 
to make that repayment or to make arrangements, satisfactory to the 
holder of the overpayment debt, to pay the overpayment renders the 
student ineligible for further title IV aid until final resolution of 
the overpayment.
    (4) If a student objects to the institution's Federal Perkins loan 
or FSEOG overpayment determination on the grounds that it is erroneous, 
the institution shall consider any information provided by the student 
and determine whether the objection is warranted.
    (5) Referral of FSEOG overpayments. (i) If the student fails to 
repay an FSEOG overpayment or make arrangements, satisfactory to the 
holder of the overpayment debt, to pay the FSEOG overpayment after 
taking the action required by paragraph (f)(3) and, if applicable, 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section, and the Federal share of the FSEOG 
overpayment is $25.00 or more, the institution shall notify the 
Secretary, identifying the Federal share of the FSEOG overpayment, the 
student's name, most recent address, telephone number, and any other 
relevant information. After notifying the Secretary under this section, 
the institution need make no further recovery efforts of FSEOG 
overpayments.
    (ii) If an institution fails in its attempt to collect the

Sec. 673.6  Coordination with BIA grants.

    (a) Coordination of BIA grants with Federal Perkins loans, FWS 
awards, or FSEOGs. To determine the amount of a Federal Perkins loan, 
FWS compensation, or an FSEOG for a student who is also eligible for a 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) education grant, an institution shall 
prepare a package of student aid--
    (1) From resources other than the BIA education grant the student 
has received or is expected to receive; and
    (2) That is consistent in type and amount with packages prepared for 
students in similar circumstances who are not eligible for a BIA 
education grant.
    (b)(1) The BIA education grant, whether received by the student 
before or after the preparation of the student aid package, supplements 
the student aid package specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) No adjustment may be made to the student aid package as long as 
the total of the package and the BIA education grant is less than the 
institution's determination of that student's financial need.
    (c)(1) If the BIA education grant, when combined with other aid in 
the package, exceeds the student's need, the excess must be deducted 
from the other assistance (except for Federal Pell Grants), not from the 
BIA education grant.
    (2) The institution shall deduct the excess in the following 
sequence: loans, work-study awards, and grants other than Federal Pell 
Grants. However, the institution may change the sequence if requested to 
do so by a student and the institution believes the change benefits the 
student.
    (d) To determine the financial need of a student who is also 
eligible for a BIA education grant, a financial aid

administrator is encouraged to consult with area officials in charge of 
BIA postsecondary financial aid.

Sec. 673.7  Administrative cost allowance.

    (a) An institution participating in the Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, 
or FSEOG programs is entitled to an administrative cost allowance for an 
award year if it advances funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, 
provides FWS employment, or awards grants under the FSEOG Program to 
students in that year.
    (b) An institution may charge the administrative cost allowance 
calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for an award 
year against-(1) The Federal Perkins Loan Fund, if the institution 
advances funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program to students in 
that award year;
    (2) The FWS allocation, if the institution provides FWS employment 
to students in that award year; and
    (3) The FSEOG allocation, if the institution awards grants to 
students under the FSEOG program in that award year.
    (c) For any award year, the amount of the administrative costs 
allowance equals--
    (1) Five percent of the first $2,750,000 of the institution's total 
expenditures to students in that award year under the FWS, FSEOG, and 
the Federal Perkins Loan programs; plus
    (2) Four percent of its expenditures to students that are greater 
than $2,750,000 but less than $5,500,000; plus
    (3) Three percent of its expenditures to students that are 
$5,500,000 or more.
    (d) The institution shall not include, when calculating the 
allowance in paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of loans made 
under the Federal Perkins Loan Program that it assigns during the award 
year to the Secretary under section 463(a)(6) of the HEA.
    (e) An institution shall use its administrative costs allowance to 
offset its cost of administering the Federal Pell Grant, FWS, FSEOG, and 
Federal Perkins Loan programs. Administrative costs also include the 
expenses incurred for carrying out the student consumer information 
services requirements of subpart D of the Student Assistance General 
Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part 668.
    (f) An institution may use up to 10 percent of the administrative 
costs allowance, as calculated under paragraph (c) of this section, that 
is attributable to the institution's expenditures under the FWS program 
to pay the administrative costs of conducting its program of community 
service. These costs may include the costs of--
    (1) Developing mechanisms to assure the academic quality of a 
student's experience;
    (2) Assuring student access to educational resources, expertise, and 
supervision necessary to achieve community service objectives; and
    (3) Collaborating with public and private nonprofit agencies and 
programs assisted under the National and Community Service Act of 1990 
in the planning, development, and administration of these programs.
    (g) If an institution charges any administrative cost allowance 
against its Federal Perkins Loan Fund, it must charge these costs during 
the same award year in which the expenditures for these costs were made.

Secs. 674.3-674.4  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 674.5  Federal Perkins Loan program cohort default rate and penalties.

    (a) Default penalty. If an institution's cohort default rate meets 
the following levels, a default penalty is imposed on the institution as 
follows:
    (1) FCC reduction. If the institution's cohort default rate equals 
or exceeds 25 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced to zero.
    (2) Ineligibility. For award year 2000-2001 and succeeding award 
years, an institution with a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 
50 percent for each of the three most recent years for which cohort 
default rate data are available is ineligible to participate in the 
Federal Perkins Loan Program. Following a review of that data and upon 
notification by the Secretary, an institution is ineligible to 
participate for the award year, or the remainder of the award year, in 
which the determination is made and the two succeeding award years. An 
institution may appeal a notification of ineligibility from the 
Secretary within 30 days of its receipt.
    (i) Appeal procedures.
    (A) Inaccurate calculation. An institution may appeal a notice of 
ineligibility based upon the submission of erroneous data by the 
institution, the correction of which would result in a recalculation 
that reduces the institution's cohort default rate to below 50 percent 
for any of the three award years used to make a determination of 
ineligibility. The Secretary considers the edit process, by which an 
institution adjusts the cohort default rate data that it submits to the 
Secretary

[[Page 577]]

on its Fiscal Operations Report, to constitute the procedure to appeal a 
determination of ineligibility based on a claim of erroneous data.
    (B) Small number of borrowers entering repayment. An institution may 
appeal a notice of ineligibility if, on average, 10 or fewer borrowers 
enter repayment for the three most recent award years used by the 
Secretary to make a determination of ineligibility.
    (C) Decision of the Secretary. The Secretary issues a decision on an 
appeal within 45 days of the institution's submission of a complete, 
accurate, and timely appeal. An institution may continue to participate 
in the program until the Secretary issues a decision on the 
institution's appeal.
    (ii) Liquidation of an institution's Perkins Loan portfolio. Within 
90 days of receiving a notification of ineligibility or, if the 
institution appeals, within 90 days of the Secretary's decision to deny 
the appeal, the institution must--
    (A) Liquidate its revolving student loan fund by making a capital 
distribution of the liquid assets of the Fund according to section 
466(c) of the HEA; and
    (B) Assign any outstanding loans in the institution's portfolio to 
the Secretary in accordance with Sec. 674.50.
    (iii) Effective date. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section are effective with the cohort default rate calculated as of June 
30, 2001.
    (b) Cohort default rate. (1) The term ``cohort default rate'' means, 
for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at 
the institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the 
institution, the percentage of those current and former students who 
enter repayment in that award year on the loans received for attendance 
at that institution who default before the end of the following award 
year.
    (2) For any award year in which less than 30 current and former 
students at the institution enter repayment on a loan received for 
attendance at the institution, the ``cohort default rate'' means the 
percentage of those current and former students who entered repayment on 
loans received for attendance at that institution in any of the three 
most recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end 
of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered 
repayment.
    (c) Defaulted loans to be included in the cohort default rate. For 
purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under paragraph (b) of 
this section--
    (1) A borrower must be included only if the borrower's default has 
persisted for at least--
    (i) 240 consecutive days for loans repayable in monthly 
installments; or
    (ii) 270 consecutive days for loans repayable in quarterly 
installments;
    (2) A loan is considered to be in default if a payment is made by 
the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, 
employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with the 
institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower;
    (3)(i) In determining the number of borrowers who default before the 
end of the following award year, a loan is excluded if the borrower has-
-
    (A) Voluntarily made six consecutive monthly payments;
    (B) Voluntarily made all payments currently due;
    (C) Repaid the full amount due, including any interest, late fees, 
and collection costs that have accrued on the loan;
    (D) Received a deferment or forbearance based on a condition that 
predates the borrower reaching a 240- or 270-day past due status;
    (E) Rehabilitated the loan after becoming 240- or 270-days past due; 
or
    (F) Assigned to the Secretary in accordance with Sec. 674.61(b).
    (ii) A loan is considered canceled and also excluded from an 
institution's cohort default rate calculation if the loan is--
    (A) Discharged due to death or permanent and total disability;
    (B) Discharged in bankruptcy;
    (C) Discharged due to a closed school; or
    (D) Repaid in full in accordance with Sec. 674.33(e) or Sec. 674(h).
    (iii) For the purpose of this section, funds obtained by income tax 
offset, garnishment, income or asset execution, or pursuant to a 
judgment are not considered voluntary.

[[Page 578]]

    (4) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more 
than one institution, the student and his or her subsequent repayment or 
default are attributed to the institution for attendance at which the 
student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.
    (d) Locations of the institution. (1) A cohort default rate of an 
institution applies to all locations of the institution as it exists on 
the first day of the award year for which the rate is calculated.
    (2) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations 
of the institution from the date the institution is notified of that 
rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the rate no 
longer applies.
    (3) For an institution that changes status from a location of one 
institution to a free-standing institution, the Secretary determines the 
cohort default rate based on the institution's status as of July 1 of 
the award year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated.
    (4)(i) For an institution that changes status from a free-standing 
institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary 
determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of 
students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the 
combined number of students who default during the applicable award 
years from both the former free-standing institution and the other 
institution. This cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated 
institution and all of its current locations.
    (ii) For free-standing institutions that merge, the Secretary 
determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of 
students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the 
combined number of students who default during the applicable award 
years from both of the institutions that are merging. This cohort 
default rate applies to the new, consolidated institution.
    (iii) For an institution that changes status from a location of one 
institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary 
determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of 
students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the 
number of students who default during the applicable award years from 
both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to the 
respective locations.
    (5) For an institution that has a change in ownership that results 
in a change in control, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the 
applicable award year and the combined number of students who default 
during the applicable award years from the institution under both the 
old and new control.

Sec. 674.9  Student eligibility.

    A student at an institution of higher education is eligible to 
receive a loan under the Federal Perkins Loan program for an award year 
if the student--
    (a) Meets the relevant eligibility requirements contained in 34 CFR 
668.32;
    (b) Is enrolled or accepted for enrollment as an undergraduate, 
graduate, or professional student at the institution, whether or not 
engaged in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the home 
institution;
    (c) Has financial need as determined in accordance with part F of 
title IV of the HEA. A member of a religious order (an order, community, 
society, agency, or organization) who is pursuing a course of study at 
an institution of higher education is considered to have no financial 
need if that religious order-
    (1) Has as its primary objective the promotion of ideals and beliefs 
regarding a Supreme Being;
    (2) Requires its members to forego monetary or other support 
substantially beyond the support it provides; and

[[Page 580]]

    (3) Directs the member to pursue the course of study or provides 
subsistence support to its members;
    (d) Has received for that award year, if an undergraduate student--
    (1) A SAR as a result of applying for a grant under the Federal Pell 
Grant Program; or
    (2) A preliminary determination of eligibility or ineligibility for 
a Federal Pell Grant by the institution's financial aid administrator 
after applying for a SAR with a Federal Pell Grant Processor;
    (e) Is willing to repay the loan. Failure to meet payment 
obligations on a previous loan is evidence that the student is unwilling 
to repay the loan;
    (f) Provides to the institution a driver's license number, if any, 
at the time of application for the loan;
    (g) Reaffirms any Federal Perkins, NDSL, or Defense loan amount that 
previously was written off (if the amount of the write-off exceeded 
$25); and
    (h)(1) In the case of a borrower whose prior loan under title IV of 
the Act was discharged after a final determination of total and 
permanent disability, obtains a certification from a physician that the 
borrower is able to engage in substantial gainful activity;
    (2) Signs a statement acknowledging that any new Federal Perkins or 
NDSL the borrower received cannot be discharged in the future on the 
basis of any present impairment, unless that condition substantially 
deteriorates; and
    (3) In the case of a borrower whose previous loan under title IV of 
the HEA was discharged due to a total and permanent disability on or 
after July 1, 2001 and before July 1, 2002, meets the requirements of 
(h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section. If the borrower applies for another 
loan within three years from the date the borrower became totally and 
permanently disabled, as certified by the physician, the borrower must 
reaffirm the previously discharged loan before receiving the new loan.
    (i) In the case of a borrower whose previous loan under title IV of 
the HEA was conditionally discharged based on an initial determination 
that the borrower was totally and permanently disabled, the borrower 
must--
    (1) Comply with the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of 
this section; and
    (2) Sign a statement acknowledging that--
    (i) The loan that has been conditionally discharged prior to a final 
determination of total and permanent disability cannot be discharged in 
the future on the basis of any impairment present when the borrower 
applied for a total and permanent disability discharge or when a new 
loan is made, unless that impairment substantially deteriorates; and
    (ii) Collection activity will resume on any loan in a conditional 
discharge period, as described in Sec. 674.61(b)(9).
    (j) Does not have any loans under title IV of the HEA on which 
collection activity has been suspended based on a conditional 
determination that the borrower was totally and permanently disabled. If 
a borrower applies for a loan under title IV of the HEA during the 
conditional discharge period described in Secs. 674.61(b), 682.402(c), 
or 685.213(a), the suspension of collection activity must be ended 
before the borrower becomes eligible to receive any additional loans.
    (k) In the case of a borrower who is in default on a Federal Perkins 
Loan, NDSL or Defense loan, satisfies one of the conditions contained in 
Sec. 674.5(c)(3)(i) or (ii) except that--
    (1) For the purposes of this section, voluntary payments made by the 
borrower under paragraph (i) of this section are those payments made 
directly by the borrower, including payments made over and above 
payments made pursuant to a judgment; and
    (2) Voluntary payments do not include payments obtained by income 
tax refund offset, garnishment, income or asset execution, or pursuant 
to a judgment.
    (l) For purposes of this section, reaffirmation means the 
acknowledgment of the loan by the borrower in a legally binding manner. 
The acknowledgement may include, but is not limited to, the borrower--
    (1) Signing a new promissory note or new repayment agreement; or

[[Page 581]]

    (2) Making a payment on the loan.

<R05>
Sec. 674.31  Promissory note.

    (a) Promissory note. (1) An institution may use only the promissory 
note that the Secretary provides. The institution may make only

during certain deferment periods as provided by this subpart, or during 
the grace period following those deferments.
    (2) Repayment. (i) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 674.32, the

10 years later;
    (B) For NDSLs made before October 1, 1980 and Federal Perkins Loans,

during which a borrower who is a member of a reserve component of the 
Armed Forces named in section 10101 of Title 10, United States Code is 
called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days. Any 
single excluded period may not exceed three years and includes the time 
necessary for the borrower to resume enrollment at the next available

    (ii) The institution shall use amounts repaid during the academic 
year in which the loan was made to reduce the original loan amount and 
not consider these amounts to be prepayments;
    (iii) If the borrower repays amounts during the academic year in 
which the loan was made and the initial grace period ended, only those 
amounts in excess of the amount due for any repayment period shall be 
treated as prepayments; and
    (iv) If, in an academic year other than that described in paragraph 
(b)(4)(iii) of this section, a borrower repays more than the amount due 
for any repayment period, the institution shall use the excess to prepay

the next regular installment.

for each additional month.
    (2) For each overdue payment on a loan payable in bimonthly 
installments, a maximum bimonthly charge of $3.
    (3) For each overdue payment on a loan payable in quarterly 
installments, a maximum charge per quarter of $6. (See appendix E of

to the Secretary for collection, the Secretary may disclose to a 
national credit bureau that the borrower has defaulted on the loan, 
along with other relevant information.

<R05>
Sec. 674.33  Repayment.

    (a) Repayment Plan. (1) The institution shall establish a repayment 
plan before the student ceases to be at least a half-time regular 
student.
    (2) If the last scheduled payment would be $25 or less the 
institution may combine it with the next-to-last repayment.
    (3) If the installment payment for all loans made to a borrower by 
an institution is not a multiple of $5, the institution may round that 
payment to the next highest dollar amount that is a multiple of $5.
    (4) The institution shall apply any payment on a loan in the 
following order:
    (i) Collection costs.
    (ii) Late charges.
    (iii) Accrued interest.
    (iv) Principal.
    (b) Minimum monthly repayment--(1) Minimum monthly repayment option. 
(i) An institution may require a borrower to pay a minimum monthly 
repayment if--
    (A) The promissory note includes a minimum monthly repayment 
provision specifying the amount of the minimum monthly repayment; and
    (B) The monthly repayment of principal and interest for a 10-year 
repayment period is less than the minimum monthly repayment; or
    (ii) An institution may require a borrower to pay a minimum monthly 
repayment if the borrower has received loans with different interest 
rates at the same institution and the total monthly repayment would 
otherwise be less than the minimum monthly repayment.
    (2) Minimum monthly repayment of loans from more than one 
institution. If a borrower has received loans from more than one 
institution, the following rules apply:
    (i) If the total of the monthly repayments is equal to at least the 
minimum monthly repayment, no institution may exercise a minimum monthly 
repayment option.
    (ii) If only one institution exercises the minimum monthly repayment 
option when the monthly repayment would otherwise be less than the 
minimum repayment option, that institution receives the difference 
between the minimum monthly repayment and the repayment owed to the 
other institution.
    (iii) If each institution exercises the minimum repayment option, 
the minimum monthly repayment must be divided among the institutions in 
proportion to the amount of principal advanced by each institution.
    (3) Minimum monthly repayment of both Defense and NDSL or Federal 
Perkins loans from one or more institutions. If the total monthly 
repayment is less than $30 and the monthly repayment on a Defense loan 
is less than $15 a month, the amount attributed to the Defense loan may 
not exceed $15 a month.
    (4) Minimum monthly repayment of loans with differing grace periods 
and deferments. If the borrower has received loans with different grace 
periods and deferments, the institution shall treat each note 
separately, and the borrower shall pay the applicable minimum monthly 
payment for a loan that is not in the grace or deferment period.
    (5) Hardship. The institution may reduce the borrower's scheduled 
repayments for a period of not more than one year at a time if--
    (i) It determines that the borrower is unable to make the scheduled 
repayments due to hardship (see Sec. 674.33(c)); and
    (ii) The borrower's scheduled repayment is the minimum monthly 
repayment described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (6) Minimum monthly repayment rates. For the purposes of this 
section, the minimum monthly repayment rate is--
    (i) $15 for a Defense loan;
    (ii) $30 for an NDSL Loan or for a Federal Perkins loan made before 
October 1, 1992, or for a Federal Perkins loan made on or after October 
1, 1992, to a borrower who, on the date the loan

[[Page 589]]

is made, has an outstanding balance of principal or interest owing on 
any loan made under this part; or
    (iii) $40 for a Federal Perkins loan made on or after October 1, 
1992, to a borrower who, on the date the loan is made, has no 
outstanding balance of principal or interest owing on any loan made 
under this part.
    (7) The institution shall determine the minimum repayment amount 
under paragraph (b) of this section for loans with repayment installment 
intervals greater than one month by multiplying the amounts in paragraph 
(b) of this section by the number of months in the installment interval.
    (c) Extension of repayment period--(1) Hardship. The institution may 
extend a borrower's repayment period due to prolonged illness or 
unemployment.
    (2) Low-income individual. (i) For Federal Perkins loans and NDSLs 
made on or after October 1, 1980, the institution may extend the 
borrower's repayment period up to 10 additional years beyond the 10-year 
maximum repayment period if the institution determines during the course 
of the repayment period that the borrower is a ``low-income 
individual.'' The borrower qualifies for an extension of the repayment 
period on the basis of low-income status only during the period in which 
the borrower meets the criteria described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) (A) or 
(B) of this section. The term low-income individual means the following:
    (A) For an unmarried borrower without dependents, an individual 
whose total income for the preceding calendar year did not exceed 45 
percent of the Income Protection Allowance for the current award year 
for a family of four with one in college.
    (B) For a borrower with a family that includes the borrower and any 
spouse or legal dependents, an individual whose total family income for 
the preceding calendar year did not exceed 125 percent of the Income 
Protection Allowance for the current award year for a family with one in 
college and equal in size to that of the borrower's family.
    (ii) The institution shall use the Income Protection Allowance 
published annually in accordance with section 478 of the HEA in making 
this determination.
    (iii) The institution shall review the borrower's status annually to 
determine whether the borrower continues to qualify for an extended 
repayment period based on his or her status as a ``low-income 
individual.''
    (iv) Upon determining that a borrower ceases to qualify for an 
extended repayment period under this section, the institution shall 
amend the borrower's repayment schedule. The term of the amended 
repayment schedule may not exceed the number of months remaining on the 
original repayment schedule, provided that the institution may not 
include the time elapsed during any extension of the repayment period 
granted under this section in determining the number of months remaining 
on the original repayment schedule.
    (3) Interest continues to accrue during any extension of a repayment 
period.
    (d) Forbearance. (1) Forbearance means the temporary cessation of 
payments, allowing an extension of time for making payments, or 
temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously were scheduled.
    (2) Upon receipt of a written request and supporting documentation, 
the institution shall grant the borrower forbearance of principal and, 
unless otherwise indicated by the borrower, interest renewable at 
intervals of up to 12 months for periods that collectively do not exceed 
three years.
    (3) The terms of forbearance must be agreed upon, in writing, by the 
borrower and the institution.
    (4) In granting a forbearance under this section, an institution 
shall grant a temporary cessation of payments, unless the borrower 
chooses another form of forbearance subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (5) An institution shall grant forbearance if--
    (i) The amount of the payments the borrower is obligated to make on 
title IV loans each month (or a proportional share if the payments are 
due less frequently than monthly) is collectively equal to or greater 
than 20 percent of the borrower's total monthly gross income;

[[Page 590]]

    (ii) The institution determines that the borrower should qualify for 
the forbearance due to poor health or for other acceptable reasons; or
    (iii) The Secretary authorizes a period of forbearance due to a 
national military mobilization or other national emergency.
    (6) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower under paragraph 
(d)(5)(i) of this section, the institution shall require the borrower to 
submit at least the following documentation:
    (i) Evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly 
gross income received by the borrower; and
    (ii) Evidence showing the amount of the monthly payments owed by the 
borrower for the most recent month for the borrower's title IV loans.
    (7) Interest accrues during any period of forbearance.
    (8) The institution may not include the periods of forbearance 
described in this paragraph in determining the 10-year repayment period.
    (e) Compromise of repayment. (1) An institution may compromise on 
the repayment of a defaulted loan if--
    (i) The institution has fully complied with all due diligence 
requirements specified in subpart C of this part; and
    (ii) The student borrower pays in a single lump-sum payment--
    (A) 90 percent of the outstanding principal balance on the loan 
under this part;
    (B) The interest due on the loan; and
    (C) Any collection fees due on the loan.
    (2) The Federal share of the compromise repayment must bear the same 
relation to the institution's share of the compromise repayment as the 
Federal capital contribution to the institution's loan Fund under this 
part bears to the institution's capital contribution to the Fund.
    (f)(1) Incentive repayment program. An institution may establish the 
following repayment incentives:
    (i) A reduction of no more than one percent of the interest rate on 
a loan on which the borrower has made 48 consecutive, monthly 
repayments.
    (ii) A discount of no more than five percent on the balance owed on 
a loan which the borrower pays in full prior to the end of the repayment 
period.
    (iii) With the Secretary's approval, any other incentive the 
institution determines will reduce defaults and replenish its Fund.
    (2) Limitation on the use of funds. (i) The institution must 
reimburse its Fund, on at least a quarterly basis, for money lost to its 
Fund that otherwise would have been paid by the borrower as a result of 
establishing a repayment incentive under paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (ii) and 
(iii) of this section.
    (ii) An institution may not use Federal funds, including Federal 
funds from the student loan fund, or institutional funds from the 
student loan fund to pay for any repayment incentive authorized by this 
section.
    (g) Closed school discharge. (1) General. (i) The holder of an NDSL 
or a Federal Perkins Loan discharges the borrower's (and any endorser's) 
obligation to repay the loan if the borrower did not complete the 
program of study for which the loan was made because the school at which 
the borrower was enrolled closed.
    (ii) For the purposes of this section--
    (A) A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to 
provide educational instruction in all programs, as determined by the 
Secretary;
    (B) ``School'' means a school's main campus or any location or 
branch of the main campus; and
    (C) The ``holder'' means the Secretary or the school that holds the 
loan.
    (2) Relief pursuant to discharge. (i) Discharge under this section 
relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the 
loan and any accrued interest or collection costs with respect to the 
loan.
    (ii) The discharge of a loan under this section qualifies the 
borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through 
enforced collection on the loan.
    (iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under this 
section is not considered to have been in default on the loan after 
discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under 
programs authorized by title IV of the HEA.
    (iv) The Secretary or the school, if the school holds the loan, 
reports the discharge of a loan under this section

[[Page 591]]

to all credit bureaus to which the status of the loan was previously 
reported.
    (3) Determination of borrower qualification for discharge by the 
Secretary. The Secretary may discharge the borrower's obligation to 
repay an NDSL or Federal Perkins Loan without an application if the 
Secretary determines that--
    (i) The borrower qualified for and received a discharge on a loan 
pursuant to 34 CFR 682.402(d) (Federal Family Education Loan Program) or 
34 CFR 685.213 (Federal Direct Loan Program), and was unable to receive 
a discharge on an NDSL or Federal Perkins Loan because the Secretary 
lacked the statutory authority to discharge the loan; or
    (ii) Based on information in the Secretary's possession, the 
borrower qualifies for a discharge.
    (4) Borrower qualification for discharge. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section, in order to qualify for discharge of 
an NDSL or Federal Perkins Loan, a borrower must submit to the holder of 
the loan a written request and sworn statement, and the factual 
assertions in the statement must be true. The statement need not be 
notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In 
the statement the borrower must--
    (i) State that the borrower--
    (A) Received the proceeds of a loan to attend a school;
    (B) Did not complete the program of study at that school because the 
school closed while the student was enrolled, or the student withdrew 
from the school not more than 90 days before the school closed (or 
longer in exceptional circumstances); and
    (C) Did not complete and is not in the process of completing the 
program of study through a teachout at another school as defined in 34 
CFR 602.2 and administered in accordance with 34 CFR 602.207(b)(6), by 
transferring academic credit earned at the closed school to another 
school, or by any other comparable means;
    (ii) State whether the borrower has made a claim with respect to the 
school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a 
performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount 
of any payment received by the borrower or credited to the borrower's 
loan obligation; and
    (iii) State that the borrower--
    (A) Agrees to provide to the holder of the loan upon request other 
documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates 
that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this 
section; and
    (B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(6) of this section and to transfer any 
right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance 
with paragraph (g)(7) of this section.
    (5) Fraudulently obtained loans. A borrower who secured a loan 
through fraudulent means, as determined by the ruling of a court or an 
administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction, is ineligible for a 
discharge under this section.
    (6) Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions. (i) In order to 
obtain a discharge under this section, a borrower must cooperate with 
the Secretary in any judicial or administrative proceeding brought by 
the Secretary to recover amounts discharged or to take other enforcement 
action with respect to the conduct on which the discharge was based. At 
the request of the Secretary and upon the Secretary's tendering to the 
borrower the fees and costs that are customarily provided in litigation 
to reimburse witnesses, the borrower must--
    (A) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the 
borrower to support a request for discharge;
    (B) Provide any documents reasonably available to the borrower with 
respect to those representations; and
    (C) If required by the Secretary, provide a sworn statement 
regarding those documents and representations.
    (ii) The holder denies the request for a discharge or revokes the 
discharge of a borrower who--
    (A) Fails to provide the testimony, documents, or a sworn statement 
required under paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section; or
    (B) Provides testimony, documents, or a sworn statement that does 
not support the material representations made by the borrower to obtain 
the discharge.

[[Page 592]]

    (7) Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery 
against third parties. (i) In the case of a loan held by the Secretary, 
upon discharge under this section, the borrower is deemed to have 
assigned to and relinquished in favor of the Secretary any right to a 
loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower may have by 
contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment 
agreement for the program for which the loan was received, against the 
school, its principals, its affiliates and their successors, its 
sureties, and any private fund, including the portion of a public fund 
that represents funds received from a private party.
    (ii) The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding any 
provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those 
rights by the borrower, limit or prevent a transferee from exercising 
those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of distribution that 
would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on those rights.
    (iii) Nothing in this section limits or forecloses the borrower's 
right to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes arising 
from matters unrelated to the discharged NDSL or Federal Perkins Loan.
    (8) Discharge procedures. (i) After confirming the date of a 
school's closure, the holder of the loan identifies any NDSL or Federal 
Perkins Loan borrower who appears to have been enrolled at the school on 
the school closure date or to have withdrawn not more than 90 days prior 
to the closure date.
    (ii) If the borrower's current address is known, the holder of the 
loan mails the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of 
the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The holder 
of the loan also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the 
borrower on any affected loan. The holder of the loan may continue to 
receive borrower payments.
    (iii) In the case of a loan held by the Secretary, if the borrower's 
current address is unknown, the Secretary attempts to locate the 
borrower and determine the borrower's potential eligibility for a 
discharge under this section by consulting with representatives of the 
closed school or representatives of the closed school's third-party 
billing and collection servicers, the school's licensing agency, the 
school accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. If the 
Secretary learns the new address of a borrower, the Secretary mails to 
the borrower a discharge application and explanation and suspends 
collection, as described in paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) In the case of a loan held by a school, if the borrower's 
current address is unknown, the school attempts to locate the borrower 
and determine the borrower's potential eligibility for a discharge under 
this section by taking steps required to locate the borrower under 
Sec. 674.44.
    (v) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section within 60 days 
of the holder of the loan's mailing the discharge application, the 
holder of the loan resumes collection and grants forbearance of 
principal and interest for the period during which collection activity 
was suspended.
    (vi) If the holder of the loan determines that a borrower who 
requests a discharge meets the qualifications for a discharge, the 
holder of the loan notifies the borrower in writing of that 
determination.
    (vii) In the case of a loan held by the Secretary, if the Secretary 
determines that a borrower who requests a discharge does not meet the 
qualifications for a discharge, the Secretary notifies that borrower, in 
writing, of that determination and the reasons for the determination.
    (viii) In the case of a loan held by a school, if the school 
determines that a borrower who requests a discharge does not meet the 
qualifications for discharge, the school submits that determination and 
all supporting materials to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary 
reviews the materials, makes an independent determination, and notifies 
the borrower in writing of the determination and the reasons for the 
determination.
    (ix) In the case of a loan held by a school and discharged by either 
the school or the Secretary, the school

[[Page 593]]

must reimburse its Fund for the entire amount of any outstanding 
principal and interest on the loan, and any collection costs charged to 
the Fund as a result of collection efforts on a discharged loan. The 
school must also reimburse the borrower for any amount of principal, 
interest, late charges or collection costs the borrower paid on a loan 
discharged under this section.

deferment--
    (i) Evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent total 
monthly gross income, as defined in section 674.2; and

the payments are due less frequently than monthly) that would have been 
owed on a Federal postsecondary education loan if the loan had been 
scheduled to be repaid in 10 years from the date the borrower entered

[[Page 595]]

    (i) Is licensed, approved, certified, or otherwise recognized by one 
of the following entities as providing rehabilitation training to 
disabled individuals--
    (A) A State agency with responsibility for vocational rehabilitation

    (B) Specifies the date on which the services to the borrower are 
expected to end; and
    (C) Is structured in a way that requires a substantial commitment by 
the borrower to his or her rehabilitation. The Secretary considers a 
substantial commitment by the borrower to be a commitment of time and 
effort that would normally prevent an individual from engaging in full-
time employment either because of the number of hours that must be 
devoted to rehabilitation or because of the nature of the 
rehabilitation.
    (h) The institution may not include the deferment periods described 
in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section and the 
period described in paragraph (i) of this section in determining the 10-

until six months after completion of any period during which the 
borrower is in deferment under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and 
(g) of this section.

default on the loan. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits an institution 
from offering the borrower flexible repayment options following the 
borrower's return to regular repayment status on a rehabilitated loan.

<R05>
Sec. 674.42  Contact with the borrower.

    (a) Disclosure of repayment information. The institution must

borrower in writing immediately upon discovering that the borrower has 
entered the repayment period. The institution must disclose the 
following information:
    (1) The name and address of the institution to which the debt is

communications should be sent.
    (2) The name and address of the party to which payments should be 
sent.

to pay all or part of an installment when due.
    (8) A description of any charges that may be imposed as a

[[Page 602]]

Secretary or the institution to collect on the loan.
    (9) The total interest charges which the borrower will pay on the 
loan pursuant to the projected repayment schedule.

at the institution. As an alternative, in the case of a student enrolled 
in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program that the school 
approves for credit, the school may provide written counseling materials 
by mail within 30 days after the borrower completes the program. If the 
borrower withdraws from school without the school's prior knowledge or 
fails to complete an exit counseling session as required, the school 
must provide exit counseling through either interactive electronic means 
or by mailing counseling material to the borrower at the borrower's last 
known address within 30 days after learning that the borrower has 
withdrawn from school or failed to complete exit counseling as required.
    (2) In conducting the exit counseling, the school must--
    (i) Inform the student as to the average anticipated monthly 
repayment amount based on the student's indebtedness or on the average 
indebtedness of students who have obtained Perkins loans for attendance 
at that school or in the borrower's program of study;
    (ii) Review for the borrower available repayment options (e.g. loan 
consolidation and refinancing, including the consequences of 
consolidating a Federal Perkins Loan);
    (iii) Suggest to the borrower debt-management strategies that the 
school determines would best assist repayment by the borrower;
    (iv) Emphasize to the borrower the seriousness and importance of the 
repayment obligation the borrower is assuming;
    (v) Describe in forceful terms the likely consequences of default, 
including adverse credit reports and litigation;
    (vi) Emphasize that the borrower is obligated to repay the full 
amount of the loan even if the borrower has not completed the program, 
is unable to obtain employment upon completion, or is otherwise 
dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services 
that the borrower purchased from the school;
    (vii) Review with the borrower the conditions under which the 
borrower may defer repayment or obtain partial cancellation of a loan;
    (viii) Require the borrower to provide corrections to the 
institution's records concerning name, address, social security number, 
references, and driver's license number, the borrower's expected 
permanent address, the address of the borrower's next of kin, as well as 
the name and address of the borrower's expected employer; and
    (ix) Review with the borrower information on the availability of the 
Student Loan Ombudsman's office.
    (3) Additional matters that the Secretary recommends that a school 
include in the exit counseling session or materials are in appendix D to 
34 CFR part 668.
    (4) An institution that conducts exit counseling through interactive 
electronic means must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student 
borrower receives the counseling materials and participates in and 
completes the exit counseling.
    (5) The institution must maintain documentation substantiating the 
school's compliance with this section for each borrower.
    (c) Contact with the borrower during the initial and post deferment 
grace periods. (1)(i) For loans with a nine-month initial grace period 
(NDSLs made before October 1, 1980 and Federal Perkins loans), the 
institution shall contact the borrower three times within the initial 
grace period.
    (ii) For loans with a six-month initial or post deferment grace 
period (loans not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section), the 
institution shall contact the borrower twice during the grace period.
    (2)(i) The institution shall contact the borrower for the first time 
90 days

[[Page 603]]

after the commencement of any grace period. The institution shall at 
this time remind the borrower of his or her responsibility to comply 
with the terms of the loan and shall send the borrower the following 
information:
    (A) The total amount remaining outstanding on the loan account, 
including principal and interest accruing over the remaining life of the 
loan.
    (B) The date and amount of the next required payment.
    (ii) The institution shall contact the borrower the second time 150 
days after the commencement of any grace period. The institution shall 
at this time notify the borrower of the date and amount of the first 
required payment.
    (iii) The institution shall contact a borrower with a nine-month 
initial grace period a third time 240 days after the commencement of the 
grace period, and shall then inform him or her of the date and amount of 
the first required payment.

Sec. 674.49  Bankruptcy of borrower.

    (a) General. If an institution receives notice that a borrower has 
filed a petition for relief in bankruptcy, usually by receiving a notice 
of meeting of creditors, the institution and its agents shall 
immediately suspend any collection efforts outside the bankruptcy 
proceeding against the borrower.
    (b) Proof of claim. The institution must file a proof of claim in 
the bankruptcy proceeding unless--
    (1) In the case of a proceeding under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy 
Code, the notice of meeting of creditors states that the borrower has no 
assets, or
    (2) In the case of a bankruptcy proceeding under either Chapter 7 or 
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in which the repayment plan proposes 
that the borrower repay less than the full amount owed on the loan, the 
institution has an authoritative determination by an appropriate State 
official that in the opinion of the State official, the institution is 
an agency of the State and is, on that basis, under applicable State 
law, immune from suit.
    (c) Borrower's request for determination of dischargeability. (1) 
The institution must use due diligence and may assert any defense 
consistent with its status under applicable law to avoid discharge of 
the loan. The institution must follow the procedures in this paragraph 
to respond to a complaint for a determination of dischargeability under 
11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) on the ground that repayment of the loan would 
impose an undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents, 
unless discharge would be more effectively opposed by avoiding that 
action.
    (2) If the petition for relief in bankruptcy was filed before 
October 8, 1998 and more than seven years of the repayment period on the 
loan (excluding any applicable suspension of the repayment period 
defined in 34 CFR 682.402(m)) have passed before the borrower filed the 
petition, the institution may not oppose a determination of 
dischargeability requested under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(B) on the ground of 
undue hardship.
    (3) In any other case, the institution must determine, on the basis 
of reasonably available information, whether repayment of the loan under 
either the current repayment schedule or any adjusted schedule 
authorized under subpart B or D of this part would impose an undue 
hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents.
    (4) If the institution concludes that repayment would not impose an 
undue hardship, the institution shall determine whether the costs 
reasonably expected to be incurred to oppose discharge will exceed one-
third of the total amount owed on the loan, including principal, 
interest, late charges and collection costs.
    (5) If the expected costs of opposing discharge of such a loan do 
not exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, the 
institution shall--
    (i) Oppose the borrower's request for a determination of 
dischargeability; and
    (ii) If the borrower is in default on the loan, seek a judgment for 
the amount owed on the loan.
    (6) In opposing a request for a determination of dischargeability, 
the institution may compromise a portion of the amount owed on the loan 
if it reasonably determines that the compromise is necessary in order to 
obtain a judgment on the loan.
    (d) Request for determination of non-dischargeability. The 
institution may file a complaint for a determination

[[Page 611]]

that a loan obligation is not dischargeable and for judgment on the loan 
if the institution would have been required under paragraph (c) of this 
section to oppose a request for a determination of dischargeability with 
regard to that loan.
    (e) Chapter 13 repayment plan. (1) The institution shall follow the 
procedures in this paragraph in response to a repayment plan proposed by 
a borrower who has filed for relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy 
Code.
    (2) The institution is not required to respond to a proposed 
repayment plan, if--
    (i) The borrower proposes under the repayment plan to repay all 
principal, interest, late charges and collection costs on the loan; or
    (ii) The repayment plan makes no provision with regard either to the 
loan obligation or to general unsecured claims.
    (3)(i) If the borrower proposes under the repayment plan to repay 
less than the total amount owed on the loan, the institution shall 
determine from its own records and court documents--
    (A) The amount of the loan obligation dischargeable under the plan 
by deducting the total payments on the loan proposed under the plan from 
the total amount owed;
    (B) Whether the plan or the classification of the loan obligation 
under the proposed plan meets the requirements of section 1325 of the 
Code; and
    (C) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to move for 
conversion or dismissal of the chapter 13 case.
    (ii) If the institution reasonably expects that costs of the 
appropriate actions will not exceed one-third of the dischargeable loan 
debt, the institution shall--
    (A) Object to confirmation of a proposed plan that does not meet the 
requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1325; and
    (B) Move to dismiss or convert a case where grounds can be 
established under 11 U.S.C. 1307.
    (4)(i) The institution must monitor the borrower's compliance with 
the requirements of the plan confirmed by the court. If the institution 
determines that the debtor has not made the payments required under the 
plan, or has filed a request for a ``hardship discharge'' under 11 
U.S.C. 1328(b), the institution must determine from its own records and 
information derived from documents filed with the court--
    (A) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to convert or dismiss 
the case; and
    (B) Whether the borrower has demonstrated entitlement to the 
``hardship discharge'' by meeting the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1328(b).
    (ii) If the institution reasonably expects that costs of the 
appropriate actions, when added to the costs already incurred in taking 
actions authorized under this section, will not exceed one-third of the 
dischargeable loan debt, the institution shall--
    (A) Move to dismiss or convert a case where grounds can be 
established under 11 U.S.C. 1307; or
    (B) Oppose the requested discharge where the debtor has not 
demonstrated that the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1328(b) are met.
    (f) Resumption of collection from the borrower. The institution 
shall resume billing and collection action prescribed in this subpart 
after--
    (1) The borrower's petition for relief in bankruptcy has been 
dismissed;
    (2) The borrower has received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. 727, 11 
U.S.C. 1141, or 11 U.S.C. 1228, unless--
    (i) The court has found that repayment of the loan would impose an 
undue hardship on the borrower and the dependents of the borrower; or
    (ii)(A) The petition for relief was filed before October 8, 1998;
    (B) The loan entered the repayment period more than seven years 
(excluding any applicable suspension of the repayment period as defined 
by 34 CFR 682.402(m), and
    (C) The loan is not excepted from discharge under other applicable 
provisions of the Code; or
    (3) The borrower has received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. 1328(a) or 
1328(b), unless--
    (i) The court has found that repayment of the loan would impose an 
undue hardship on the borrower and the dependents of the borrower; or
    (ii)(A) The petition for relief was filed before October 8, 1998;

[[Page 612]]

    (B) The loan entered the repayment period more than seven years 
(excluding any application suspension of the repayment period as defined 
by 34 CFR 682.402(m) before the filing of the petition; and
    (C) The borrower's plan approved in the bankruptcy proceeding made 
some provision with regard to either the loan obligation or unsecured 
debts in general.
    (g) Termination of collection and write-off. (1) An institution must 
terminate all collection action and write off a loan if it receives a 
general order of discharge--
    (i) In a bankruptcy in which the borrower filed for relief before 
October 8, 1998, if the loan entered the repayment period more than 
seven years (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the repayment 
period defined by 34 CFR 682.402(m)) from the date on which a petition 
for relief was filed; or
    (ii) In any other case, a judgment that repayment of the debt would 
constitute an undue hardship and that the debt is therefore 
dischargeable.
    (2) If an institution receives a repayment from a borrower after a 
loan has been discharged, it must deposit that payment in its Fund.

<R05>
Sec. 674.61  Cancellation for death or disability.

    (a) Death. An institution must discharge the unpaid balance of a 
borrower's Defense, NDSL, or Perkins loan, including interest, if the 
borrower dies. The institution must discharge the loan on the basis of 
an original or certified copy of the death certificate. Under 
exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, the chief 
financial officer of the institution may approve a discharge based upon 
other reliable documentation supporting the discharge request.
    (b) Total and permanent disability. (1) If the Secretary has made an 
initial determination that the borrower is totally and permanently 
disabled, as defined in Sec. 674.51(s), the loan is conditionally 
discharged for up to three years from the date that the borrower became 
totally and permanently disabled, as certified by a physician. The 
Secretary suspends collection activity on the loan from the date of the 
initial determination of total and permanent disability until the end of 
the three-year conditional period. If the borrower satisfies the 
criteria for a total and permanent disability discharge during and at 
the end of the conditional discharge period, the balance of the loan is 
discharged at the end of the conditional discharge period and any 
payments received after the date the borrower became totally and 
permanently disabled as certified under Sec. 674.61(b)(3) are returned 
to the sender.
    (2) A borrower satisfies the criteria for a discharge of a loan 
based on a total and permanent disability if, during and at the end of 
the three-year conditional discharge period described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section--
    (i) The borrower's annual earnings from employment do not exceed 100 
percent of the poverty line for a family of two, as determined in 
accordance with the Community Service Block Grant Act; and
    (ii) The borrower does not receive a new loan under the Perkins, 
FFEL or Direct Loan programs, except for a FFEL or Direct Consolidation 
Loan that does not include any loans that are in a conditional discharge 
status.
    (3) If a borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled after 
receiving a Defense, NDSL, or Perkins loan, the institution must assign 
the loan to the Secretary if the borrower submits a certification by a 
physician and the institution reviewed the application and determined 
that it is complete and that it supports the conclusion that the 
borrower has a total and permanent disability as defined in 
Sec. 674.51(s).
    (4) At the time the loan is assigned to the Secretary the 
institution must notify the borrower that the loan has been assigned to 
the Secretary for determination of eligibility for a total and permanent 
disability discharge.
    (5) If the Secretary determines that the certification provided by 
the borrower does not support the conclusion that the borrower meets the 
criteria for a total and permanent disability discharge, the Secretary 
notifies the borrower that the application for a disability discharge 
has been denied, and that the loan is due and payable under the terms of 
the promissory note.
    (6) If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the 
borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the Secretary notifies the 
borrower that the loan will be in a conditional discharge status for a 
period of up to three years after the date the borrower became totally 
and permanently disabled as certified under Sec. 674.61(b)(3). This 
notification identifies the conditions of the conditional discharge 
period specified in paragraphs (b)(6) through (b)(9) of this section and 
specifies that all or part of the three-year period may predate the 
Secretary's initial determination.
    (7) During the conditional discharge period, the borrower--
    (i) Is not required to make any payments on the loan;
    (ii) Is not considered past due or in default on the loan, unless 
the loan was past due or in default at the time the conditional 
discharge was granted;

[[Page 622]]

    (iii) Must promptly notify the Secretary of any changes in address 
or phone number;
    (iv) Must promptly notify the Secretary if the borrower's annual 
earnings from employment exceed the amount specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (v) Must provide the Secretary, upon request, with additional 
documentation or information related to the borrower's eligibility for 
discharge under this section.
    (8) If, during and at the end of the conditional discharge period, 
the borrower continues to satisfy the eligibility criteria for a total 
and permanent disability discharge, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, the balance of the loan is discharged.
    (9) If, at any time during or at the end of the three-year 
conditional discharge period, the borrower does not continue to meet the 
eligibility requirements for total and permanent disability discharge, 
the Secretary resumes collection activity on the loan. The Secretary 
does not require the borrower to pay any interest that accrued on the 
loan from the date of the initial determination described in paragraph 
(b)(6) of this section through the end of the conditional discharge 
period.
    (10) If the institution receives any payments from or on behalf of 
the borrower on or attributable to a loan that has been assigned to the 
Secretary for determination of eligibility for a total and permanent 
disability discharge, the institution must forward those payments to the 
Secretary for crediting to the borrower's account. At the same time that 
the institution forwards the payment, it must notify the borrower that 
there is no obligation to make payments on the loan while it is 
conditionally discharged prior to a final determination of eligibility 
for a total and permanent disability discharge, unless the Secretary 
directs the borrower otherwise.
    (11) When the Secretary makes a final determination to discharge the 
loan, the Secretary returns to the sender any payments received on the 
loan after the date the borrower became totally and permanently 
disabled.
    (c) No Federal reimbursement. No Federal reimbursement is made to an 
institution for cancellation of loans due to death or disability.
    (d) Retroactive. Cancellation for death or disability applies 
retroactively to all Defense, NDSL or Perkins loans.

Sec. 676.10  Selection of students for FSEOG awards.

    (a)(1) In selecting among eligible students for FSEOG awards in each 
award year, an institution shall select those students with the lowest 
expected family contributions who will also receive Federal Pell Grants 
in that year.
    (2) If the institution has FSEOG funds remaining after giving FSEOG

students with the lowest expected family contributions who will not 
receive Federal Pell Grants.
    (b) Part-time and independent students. If an institution's 
allocation of FSEOG funds is directly or indirectly based in part on the 
financial need demonstrated by students attending the institution as 
less-than-full-time or independent students, a reasonable portion of the 
allocation must be offered to those students.

                      Subpart A--Purpose and Scope


<R05>
Sec. 682.100  The Federal Family Education Loan programs.

    (a) This part governs the following four programs collectively 
referred to in these regulations as ``the Federal Family Education Loan 
(FFEL) programs,'' in which lenders use their own funds to make loans to 
enable a student or his or her parents to pay the costs of the student's 
attendance at postsecondary schools:
    (1) The Federal Stafford Loan (Stafford) Program, which encourages 
making loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.
    (2) The Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program, as in 
effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994, which 
encouraged making loans to graduate, professional, independent 
undergraduate, and certain dependent undergraduate students.
    (3) The Federal PLUS (PLUS) Program, which encourages making loans 
to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Before October 17, 1986, 
the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to graduate, 
professional, and independent undergraduate students. Before July 1, 
1993, the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to parents of 
dependent graduate students.
    (4) The Federal Consolidation Loan Program (Consolidation Loan 
Program), which encourages making loans to borrowers for the purpose of 
consolidating loans: under the Federal Insured Student Loan (FISL), 
Stafford loan, SLS, ALAS (as in effect before October 17, 1986), PLUS, 
Perkins Loan programs, the Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL) 
including Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Program authorized by 
subpart II of part A of Title VII of the Public Health Services Act, 
Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) authorized by subpart I of Part 
A of Title VII of the Health Services Act, Nursing Student Loan Program 
loans authorized by subpart II of part B of title VIII of the Public 
Health Service Act, and existing loans obtained under the Consolidation 
Loan Program, and William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program 
loans, if the application for the Consolidation loan was received on or 
after November 13, 1997.
    (b)(1) Except for the loans guaranteed directly by the Secretary 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a guaranty agency 
guarantees a lender against losses due to default by the borrower on a 
FFEL loan. If the guaranty agency meets certain Federal requirements, 
the guaranty agency is reimbursed by the Secretary for all or part of 
the amount of default claims it pays to lenders.
    (2)(i) The Secretary guarantees lenders against losses--
    (A) Within the Stafford Loan Program, on loans made under Federal 
Insured Student Loan (FISL) Program;

[[Page 643]]

    (B) Within the PLUS Program, on loans made under the Federal PLUS 
Program;
    (C) Within the SLS Program, on loans made under the Federal SLS 
Program as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 
1, 1994; and
    (D) Within the Consolidation Loan Program, on loans made under the 
Federal Consolidation Loan Program.
    (ii) The loan programs listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section 
collectively are referred to in these regulations as the ``Federal 
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs.''
    (iii) The Federal GSL programs are authorized to operate in States 
not served by a guaranty agency program. In addition, the FISL and 
Federal SLS (as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to 
July 1, 1994) programs are authorized, under limited circumstances, to 
operate in States in which a guaranty agency program does not serve all 
eligible students.

Sec. 682.101  Participation in the FFEL programs.

    (a) Eligible banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, 
pension funds, insurance companies, schools, and State and private 
nonprofit agencies may make loans.
    (b) Institutions of higher education, including most colleges, 
universities, graduate and professional schools, and many vocational, 
technical schools may participate as schools, enabling an eligible 
student or his or her parents to obtain a loan to pay for the student's 
cost of education.
    (c) Students who meet certain requirements, including enrollment at 
a participating school, may borrow under the Stafford Loan and, for 
periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994, the SLS program. 
Parents of eligible dependent undergraduate students may borrow under 
the PLUS Program. Borrowers with outstanding Stafford, SLS, FISL, 
Perkins, HPSL, HEAL, ALAS, PLUS, or Nursing Student Loan Program loans, 
or married couples each of whom have eligible loans under these programs 
may borrow under the Consolidation Loan Program.

<R05>
Sec. 682.102  Obtaining and repaying a loan.

    (a) Stafford loan application. Generally, to obtain a Stafford loan 
a student requests a loan by completing the Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid (FAFSA), or contacting the school, lender or guarantor. The 
school determines and certifies the student's eligibility for the loan. 
Prior to loan disbursement, the lender obtains a loan guarantee from a 
guaranty agency or the Secretary and the student completes a promissory 
note, unless the student has previously completed a Master Promissory 
Note (MPN) that the lender may use for the new loan.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) PLUS loan application. Generally, to obtain a PLUS loan, both 
the student and the parent complete an application and submit it to the 
school for certification. After the school certifies the application, 
the application is submitted to a participating lender. If the lender 
decides to make the loan, the lender obtains a loan guarantee from a 
guaranty agency or the Secretary.
    (d) Consolidation loan application. To obtain a Consolidation loan, 
a borrower completes an application and submits it to the lender holding 
the borrower's FFEL Program loan or loans. If the borrower has multiple 
holders of FFEL Program loans, or if the borrower's single loan holder 
declines to make a Consolidation loan, or declines to make one with 
income-sensitive repayment terms, the borrower may submit the 
application to any lender participating in the Consolidation Loan 
Program. In the case of a married couple seeking a Consolidation loan, 
if at least one of the applicants has multiple holders, the applicants 
may submit the application to any lender participating in the 
Consolidation Loan Program. If both applicants have a single holder, 
only the holder for one of the applicants must be contacted for 
consolidation. If a lender decides to make the loan, the

[[Page 644]]

lender obtains a loan guarantee from a guaranty agency or the Secretary.
    (e) Repaying a loan--(1) General. Generally, the borrower is 
obligated to repay the full amount of the loan, late fees, collection 
costs chargeable to the borrower, and any interest not payable by the 
Secretary. The borrower's obligation to repay is cancelled if the 
borrower dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, or has that 
obligation discharged in bankruptcy. The borrower's obligation to repay 
a PLUS loan is cancelled if the student, on whose behalf the parent 
borrowed, dies. The borrower's or student's obligation to repay all or a 
portion of his or her loan may be cancelled if the student is unable to 
complete his or her program of study because the school closed or the 
borrower's or student's eligibility to borrow was falsely certified by 
the school. The obligation to repay all or a portion of a loan may be 
forgiven for Stafford loan borrowers who enter certain areas of the 
teaching or nursing professions or perform certain kinds of national or 
community service.
    (2) Stafford loan repayment. In the case of a subsidized Stafford 
loan, a borrower is not required to make any principal payments on a 
Stafford loan during the time the borrower is in school. The Secretary 
pays the interest on the borrower's behalf during the time the borrower 
is in school. When the borrower ceases to be enrolled on at least a 
half-time basis, a grace period begins during which no principal 
payments are required, and the Secretary continues to make interest 
payments on the borrower's behalf. In the case of an unsubsidized 
Stafford loan, the borrower is responsible for interest during these 
periods. At the end of the grace period, the repayment period begins. 
During the repayment period, for the subsidized and unsubsidized 
Stafford loan, the borrower pays both the principal and the interest 
accruing on the loan.
    (3) SLS loan repayment. Generally, the repayment period for an SLS 
loan begins immediately on the day of the last disbursement of the loan 
proceeds by the lender. The first payment of principal and interest on 
an SLS loan is due from the borrower within 60 days after the loan is 
fully disbursed unless a borrower who is also a Stafford loan borrower, 
but who has not yet entered repayment on the Stafford loan, requests 
that commencement of repayment on the SLS loan be deferred until the 
borrower's grace period on the Stafford loan expires.
    (4) PLUS loan repayment. Generally, the repayment period for a PLUS 
loan begins on the day the loan is fully disbursed by the lender. The 
first payment of principal and interest on a PLUS loan is due from the 
borrower within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed.
    (5) Consolidation loan repayment. Generally, the repayment period 
for a Consolidation loan begins on the day the loan is disbursed. The 
first payment of principal and interest on a Consolidation loan is due 
from the borrower within 60 days after the borrower's liability on all 
loans being consolidated has been discharged.
    (6) Deferment of repayment. Repayment of principal on a FFEL program 
loan may be deferred under the circumstances described in Sec. 682.210.
    (7) Default. If a borrower defaults on a loan, the guarantor 
reimburses the lender for the amount of its loss. The guarantor then 
collects the amount owed from the borrower.

Sec. 682.201  Eligible borrowers.

    (a) Student borrower. Except for a refinanced SLS/PLUS loan made 
under Sec. 682.209 (e) or (f), a student is eligible to receive a 
Stafford loan, and an independent undergraduate student, a graduate or 
professional student, or, subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a 
dependent undergraduate student, is eligible to receive an unsubsidized 
Stafford loan, if the student who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment 
on at least a half-time basis at a participating school meets the 
requirements for an eligible student under 34 CFR part 668, and--
    (1) In the case of an undergraduate student who seeks a Stafford 
loan or unsubsidized Stafford loan for the cost of attendance at a 
school that participates in the Pell Grant Program, has received a final 
determination, or, in the case of a student who has filed an application 
with the school for a Pell Grant, a preliminary determination, from the 
school of the student's eligibility or ineligibility for a Pell Grant 
and, if eligible, has applied for the period of enrollment for which the 
loan is sought;
    (2) In the case of any student who seeks an unsubsidized Stafford 
loan for the cost of attendance at a school that participates in the 
Stafford Loan Program, the student must--
    (i) Receive a determination of need for a subsidized Stafford loan; 
and
    (ii) If the determination of need is in excess of $200, have made a 
request to a lender for a subsidized Stafford loan;
    (3) For purposes of a dependent undergraduate student's eligibility 
for an additional unsubsidized Stafford loan amount, as described at 
Sec. 682.204(d), is a dependent undergraduate student for whom the 
financial aid administrator determines and documents in the school's 
file, after review of the family financial information provided by the 
student and consideration of the student's debt burden, that the 
student's parents likely will be precluded by exceptional circumstances 
(e.g., denial of a PLUS loan to a parent based on adverse credit, the 
student's parent receives only public assistance or disability benefits, 
is incarcerated, or his or her whereabouts are unknown) from borrowing 
under the PLUS Program and the student's family is otherwise unable to 
provide the student's expected family contribution. A parent's refusal 
to borrow a PLUS loan does not constitute an exceptional circumstance;
    (4)(i) Reaffirms any FFEL loan amount on which there has been a 
total cessation of collection activity,

delinquency constitutes the borrower's consent to capitalization of 
delinquent interest and all interest that will accrue through the 
remainder of that period.
    (c) Fees for FFEL Program loans. (1) A lender may charge a borrower 
an origination fee on a Stafford loan not to exceed 3 percent of the

comparable to that defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) If a lender charges a lower origination fee on unsubsidized 
loans under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the lender must 
charge the same fee on subsidized loans.

borrowers who reside in that state or attend school in that state the 
same origination fee.
    (5) Shall charge a borrower an origination fee on a PLUS loan of 3 
percent of the principal amount of the loan;
    (6) Shall deduct a pro rata portion of the fee (if charged) from 
each disbursement; and
    (7) Shall refund by a credit against the borrower's loan balance the

the Act or with applicable regulations;

a different purpose; or
    (B) The borrower has a FFEL Program loan in repayment status, in

returned funds be applied as a cancellation of all or part of the loan;
    (iii) For which a loan check has not been negotiated within 120 days 
of disbursement; or
    (iv) For which loan proceeds disbursed by electronic funds transfer

of the insurance premium paid by the lender to the guarantor up to 1 
percent of the principal amount of the loan, if that charge is provided 
for in the promissory note.

purpose of refinancing a PLUS or SLS loan to secure a variable interest 
rate.
    (f) Late charge. (1) If authorized by the borrower's promissory 
note, the lender may require the borrower to pay a late charge under the 
circumstances described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. This charge 
may not exceed six cents for each dollar of each late installment.

    (3) With the exception of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii), 
(a)(2)(v) through (a)(2)(vii), and (a)(2)(xx) of this section, a 
lender's disclosure requirements are met if it provides the borrower 
with either--
    (i) The borrower's rights and responsibilities statement approved by 
the Secretary under paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (ii) The plain language disclosure approved by the Secretary under 
paragraph (g) of this section for subsequent loans made under a Master 
Promissory Note.
    (b) Separate statement of borrower rights and responsibilities. In 
addition to the disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section, 
the lender must provide the borrower with a separate written statement, 
using simple and understandable terms, at or prior to the time of the 
first disbursement, that summarizes the rights and responsibilities of 
the borrower with respect to the loan. The statement must also warn the 
borrower about the consequences described in paragraph (a)(2)(xvi) of 
this section if the borrower defaults on the loan. The Borrower's Rights 
and Responsibilities statement approved by the Secretary satisfies this 
requirement.
    (c) Disclosure of repayment information. (1) The lender must 
disclose the information described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
in simple and understandable terms, in a statement provided to the 
borrower at or prior to the beginning of the repayment period. In the 
case of a Federal Stafford or Federal SLS loan, the disclosures required 
by this paragraph must be made not less than 30 days nor more than 240 
days before the first payment on the loan is due from the borrower. If 
the borrower enters the repayment period without the lender's knowledge, 
the lender must provide the required disclosures to the borrower 
immediately upon discovering that the borrower has entered the repayment 
period.
    (2) The lender shall provide the borrower with--
    (i) The lender's name, a toll-free telephone number accessible from 
within the United States that the borrower can use to obtain additional 
loan information, and the address to which correspondence with the 
lender and payments should be sent;
    (ii) The scheduled date the repayment period is to begin;
    (iii) The estimated balance, including the estimated amount of 
interest to be capitalized, owed by the borrower as of the date upon 
which the repayment period is to begin, or the date of the disclosure, 
whichever is later;
    (iv) The actual interest rate on the loan;
    (v) An explanation of any fees that may accrue or be charged to the 
borrower during the repayment period;
    (vi) The borrower's repayment schedule, including the due date of 
the first installment and the number, amount, and frequency of payments;
    (vii) Except in the case of a Consolidation loan, an explanation of 
any special options the borrower may have for consolidating or 
refinancing the loan and of the availability and terms of such other 
options;
    (viii) The estimated total amount of interest to be paid on the 
loan, assuming that payments are made in accordance with the repayment 
schedule; and
    (ix) A statement that the borrower has the right to prepay all or 
part of the loan at any time, without penalty.
    (d) Exception to disclosure requirement. In the case of a Federal 
PLUS loan, the lender is not required to provide the information in 
paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section if the lender, instead of that 
disclosure, provides the borrower with sample projections of the monthly 
repayment amounts assuming different levels of borrowing and interest 
accruals resulting from capitalization of interest while the student is 
in school. Sample projections must disclose the cost to the borrower of 
principal and interest, interest only, and capitalized

[[Page 666]]

interest. The lender may rely on the PLUS promissory note and associated 
materials approved by the Secretary for purposes of complying with this 
section.
    (e) Borrower may not be charged for disclosures. The lender must 
provide the information required by this section at no cost to the 
borrower.
    (f) Method of disclosure. Any disclosure of information by a lender 
under this section may be through written or electronic means.
    (g) Plain language disclosure. The plain language disclosure text, 
as approved by the Secretary, must be provided to a borrower in 
conjunction with subsequent loans taken under a previously signed Master 
Promissory Note. The requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section are satisfied for subsequent loans if the borrower is sent the 
plain language disclosure text and an initial disclosure containing the 
information required by paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii), (a)(2)(v), 
(a)(2)(vi), (a)(2)(vii), and (a)(2)(xx) of this section.
    (h) Notice of availability of income-sensitive repayment option. (1) 
At the time of offering a borrower a loan and at the time of offering a 
borrower repayment options, the lender must provide the borrower with a 
notice that informs the borrower of the availability of income-sensitive 
repayment. This information may be provided in a separate notice or as 
part of the other disclosures required by this section. The notice must 
inform the borrower--
    (i) That the borrower is eligible for income-sensitive repayment, 
including through loan consolidation;
    (ii) Of the procedures by which the borrower can elect income-
sensitive repayment; and
    (iii) Of where and how the borrower may obtain more information 
concerning income-sensitive repayment.
    (2) The promissory note and associated materials approved by the 
Secretary satisfy the loan origination notice requirements provided for 
in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

Sec. 682.206  Due diligence in making a loan.

    (a) General. (1) Loan-making duties include determining the 
borrower's loan amount, approving the borrower for a loan, explaining to 
the borrower his or her rights and responsibilities under the loan, and 
completing and having the borrower sign the promissory note (except with 
respect to subsequent loans made under an MPN).
    (2) A lender that delegates substantial loan-making duties to a 
school on a loan thereby enters into a loan origination relationship 
with the school in regard to that loan. If that relationship exists, the 
lender may rely in good faith upon statements of the borrower made in 
the loan application process, but may not rely upon statements made by 
the school in that process. A non-school lender that does not have an 
origination relationship with a school with respect to a loan may rely 
in good faith upon statements of both the borrower and the school in the 
loan application process. Except as provided in 34 CFR part 668, subpart 
E, a school lender may rely in good faith upon statements made by the 
borrower in the loan application process.
    (b) Processing forms. Before disbursing a loan, a lender must 
determine that all required forms have been accurately completed by the 
borrower, the student, the school, and the lender. A lender may not ask 
the borrower to sign any form before the borrower has provided on the 
form all information requested from the borrower.
    (c) Approval of borrower and determination of loan amount. (1) A 
lender

[[Page 667]]

may make a loan only to an eligible borrower. To the extent authorized 
by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the lender may rely on the 
information provided by the school, the borrower, and, if the borrower 
is a parent, the student on whose behalf the loan is sought, in 
determining the borrower's eligibility for a loan.
    (2) Except in the case of a Consolidation loan, in determining the 
amount of the loan to be made, in no case may the loan amount exceed the 
lesser of the amount the borrower requests, the amount certified by the 
school under Sec. 682.603, or the loan limits under Sec. 682.204.
    (d)(1) The lender must ensure that each loan is supported by an 
executed legally-enforceable promissory note as proof of the borrower's 
indebtedness.
    (e) Security, endorsement, and co-makers. (1) A FISL, SLS or Federal 
PLUS loan must be made without security or endorsement.
    (2) A Federal PLUS Program Loan may be made to an eligible borrower 
with an endorser who is secondarily liable for repayment of the loan.
    (3) A Federal Consolidation loan may be made to two eligible spouses 
provided both borrowers agree to be jointly and severally liable for 
repayment of the loan as co-makers.
    (f) Additional requirement for Consolidation loans. (1) Prior to 
disbursement of a Consolidation loan, the lender shall obtain from the 
holder of each loan to be consolidated a certification with respect to 
the loan held by the holder that--
    (i) The loan is a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the 
borrower;
    (ii) The loan was made and serviced in compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations; and
    (iii) In the case of a FFEL loan, that the guarantee on the loan is 
in full force and effect.
    (2) The Consolidation loan lender may rely in good faith on the 
certification provided under paragraph (f)(1) of this section by the 
holder of a loan to be consolidated.

are receiving a portion of the disbursement; or
    (C) If the school and the lender agree, a master check from the

trustee for the lender. A disbursement made by electronic funds transfer 
or master check must be accompanied by a list of the names, social 
security numbers, and loan amounts of the borrowers who are receiving a 
portion of the disbursement and the names and social security numbers of 
the students on whose behalf the parents are borrowing.
    (2) By a check from the lender that is made co-payable to the 
institution and the parent borrower directly to the institution of

sent directly to either the parent or the institution of higher 
education.
    (C) In the case of a student enrolled in a study-abroad program

Sec. 682.208  Due diligence in servicing a loan.

    (a) The loan servicing process includes reporting to national credit 
bureaus, responding to borrower inquiries, and establishing the terms of 
repayment.
    (b)(1) An eligible lender of a FFEL loan shall report to at least 
one national credit bureau--
    (i) The total amount of FFEL loans the lender has made to the 
borrower, within 90 days of each disbursement;

    (c)(1) A lender shall respond within 30 days after receipt to any 
inquiry from a borrower or any endorser on a loan.
    (2) When a lender learns that a Stafford loan borrower is no longer

basis, the lender shall promptly contact the borrower in

[[Page 670]]

order to establish the terms of repayment.
    (3)(i) If the borrower disputes the terms of the loan in writing and 
the lender does not resolve the dispute, the lender's response must 
provide the borrower with an appropriate contact at the guaranty agency 
for the resolution of the dispute.
    (ii) If the guaranty agency does not resolve the dispute, the 
agency's response must provide the borrower with information on the

    (d) Subject to the rules regarding maximum duration of a repayment 
period and minimum annual payment described in Sec. 682.209(a)(7), (c), 
and (h), nothing in this part is intended to limit a lender's discretion 
in establishing, or, with the borrower's consent, revising a borrower's 
repayment schedule--
    (1) To provide for graduated or income-sensitive repayment terms. 
The Secretary strongly encourages lenders to provide a graduated or 
income-sensitive repayment schedule to a borrower providing for at least 
the payment of interest charges, unless the borrower requests otherwise, 
in order to make the borrower's repayment burden commensurate with his 
or her projected ability to pay; or
    (2) To provide a single repayment schedule for all FFEL program 
loans to the borrower held by the lender.
    (e)(1) If the assignment of a Stafford, PLUS, SLS, or Consolidation 
loan is to result in a change in the identity of the party to whom the 
borrower must send subsequent payments, the assignor and assignee of the 
loan shall, no later than 45 days from the date the assignee acquires a 
legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the 
assigned loan, provide, either jointly or separately, a notice to the 
borrower of--

assignment.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``assigned'' is defined 
in Sec. 682.401(b)(17)(ii).
    (4) The assignee, or the assignor on behalf of the assignee, shall

of the assignee that can be used to obtain information about the 
repayment of the loan.
    (5) The requirements of this paragraph (e), as to borrower 
notification, apply if the borrower is in a grace period or has entered 
the repayment period.
    (f)(1) Notwithstanding an error by the school or lender, a lender 
shall follow the procedures in Sec. 682.412 whenever it receives 
information that can be substantiated that the borrower, or the student 
on whose behalf a parent has borrowed, provided false or erroneous 
information or took actions that caused the student or borrower--
    (i) To be ineligible for all or a portion of a loan made under this 
part;
    (ii) To receive a Stafford loan subject to payment of Federal 
interest benefits as provided under Sec. 682.301, for which he or she

    (iii) To receive loan proceeds that were not paid to the school or 
repaid to the lender by or on behalf of a registered student who--
    (A) The school notifies the lender under Sec. 682.604(d)(4) has 
withdrawn or been expelled prior to the first day of classes for the 
period of enrollment for which the loan was intended; or
    (B) Failed to attend school during that period.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``guaranty agency'' in 
Sec. 682.412(e) refers to the Secretary in the case of a Federal GSL 
loan.
    (g) If, during a period when the borrower is not delinquent, a 
lender receives information indicating it does not know the borrower's 
address, it

[[Page 671]]

may commence the skip-tracing activities specified in Sec. 682.411(g).
    (h) Notifying the borrower about a servicing change. If an FFEL 
Program loan has not been assigned, but there is a change in the 
identity of the party to whom the borrower must send subsequent payments 
or direct any communications concerning the loan, the holder of the loan 
shall, no later than 45 days after the date of the change, provide 
notice to the borrower of the name, telephone number, and address of the

Sec. 682.209  Repayment of a loan.

    (a) Conversion of a loan to repayment status. (1) For a 
Consolidation loan, the repayment period begins on the date the loan is 
disbursed. The first payment is due within 60 days after the date the 
loan is disbursed.
    (2)(i) For a PLUS loan, the repayment period begins on the date of 
the last disbursement made on the loan. Interest accrues and is due and 
payable from the date of the first disbursement of the loan. The first 
payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is fully 
disbursed.
    (ii) For an SLS loan, the repayment period begins on the date the 
loan is disbursed, or, if the loan is disbursed in multiple 
installments, on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Interest 
accrues and is due and payable from the date of the first disbursement 
of the loan. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii), (a)(2)(iv), 
and (a)(2)(v) of this section the first payment is due within 60 days 
after the date the loan is fully disbursed.
    (iii) For an SLS borrower who has not yet entered repayment on a 
Stafford loan, the borrower may postpone payment, consistent with the 
grace period on the borrower's Stafford loan.
    (iv) If the lender first learns after the fact that an SLS borrower 
has entered the repayment period, the repayment begins no later than 75 
days after the date the lender learns that the borrower has entered the 
repayment period.
    (v) The lender may establish a first payment due date that is no 
more than an additional 30 days beyond the period specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i)--(a)(2)(iv) of this section in order for the lender 
to comply with the required deadline contained in Sec. 682.205(c)(1).
    (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this 
section, for a Stafford loan the repayment period begins--
    (A) For a borrower with a loan for which the applicable interest 
rate is 7 percent per year, not less than 9 nor more than 12 months 
following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at 
least a half-time basis at an eligible school. The length of this grace 
period is determined by the lender for loans made under the FISL 
Program, and by the guaranty agency for loans guaranteed by the agency;
    (B) For a borrower with a loan for which the initial applicable 
interest rate is 8 or 9 percent per year, the day after 6 months 
following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at 
least a half-time basis at an institution of higher education; and
    (C) For a borrower with a loan with a variable interest rate, the 
day after 6 months following the date on which the borrower is no longer 
enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an institution of higher 
education.
    (ii) The first payment on a Stafford loan is due on a date 
established by the lender that is no more than--
    (A) 45 days following the first day that the repayment period 
begins;
    (B) 45 days from the expiration of a deferment or forbearance period 
unless the borrower during this period has submitted payments with 
instructions that those payments are intended for future installment 
payments;
    (C) 45 days following the end of the post deferment grace period;

[[Page 672]]

    (D) If the lender first learns after the fact that the borrower has 
entered the repayment period, no later than 75 days after the date the 
lender learns that the borrower has entered the repayment period; or
    (E) An additional 30 days beyond the periods specified in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(ii)(A)-(a)(3)(ii)(D) of this section in order for the lender to 
comply with the required deadlines contained in Sec. 682.205(c)(1).
    (4) For a borrower of a Stafford loan who is a correspondence 
student, the grace period specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section begins on the earliest of--
    (i) The day after the borrower completes the program;
    (ii) The day after withdrawal as determined pursuant to 34 CFR 
668.22; or
    (iii) 60 days following the last day for completing the program as 
established by the school.
    (5) For a Stafford loan, the repayment period begins prior to the 
end of the grace period if the borrower requests in writing and is 
granted a repayment schedule that so provides. In this event, a borrower 
waives the remainder of the grace period.
    (6) For purposes of establishing the beginning of the repayment 
period for Stafford and SLS loans, the grace periods referenced in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (a)(3)(i) of this section exclude any period 
during which a borrower who is a member of a reserve component of the 
Armed Forces named in section 10101 of title 10, United States Code is 
called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days. Any 
single excluded period may not exceed three years and includes the time 
necessary for the borrower to resume enrollment at the next available 
regular enrollment period. Any Stafford or SLS borrower who is in a 
grace period when called or ordered to active duty as specified in this 
paragraph is entitled to a full grace period upon completion of the 
excluded period.
    (7)(i) The repayment schedule may provide for substantially equal 
installment payments or for installment payments that increase or 
decrease in amount during the repayment period. If the loan has a 
variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a 
repayment schedule that--
    (A) Provides for adjustments of the amount of the installment 
payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest rate; or
    (B) Contains no provision for an adjustment of the amount of the 
installment payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest 
rate, but requires the lender to grant a forbearance to the borrower (or 
endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 3 years of payments in 
accordance with Sec. 682.211(i)(5) in cases where the effect of a 
variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule 
would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment 
term.
    (ii) If a graduated or income-sensitive repayment schedule is 
established, it may not provide for any single installment that is more 
than three times greater than any other installment. An agreement as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the 
schedule provides for less than the minimum annual payment amount 
specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Not more than six months prior to the date that the borrower's 
first payment is due, the lender must offer the borrower a choice of a 
standard, income-sensitive, graduated, or, if applicable, an extended 
repayment schedule.
    (iv) The repayment schedule must require that each payment equal at 
least the interest that accrues during the interval between scheduled 
payments.
    (v) The lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan under a 
standard repayment schedule described in paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this 
section if the borrower--
    (A) Does not select an income-sensitive, a graduated, or if 
applicable, an extended repayment schedule within 45 days after being 
notified by the lender to choose a repayment schedule; or
    (B) Chooses an income-sensitive repayment schedule, but does not 
provide the documentation requested by the lender under paragraph 
(a)(7)(viii)(C) of this section within the time period specified by the 
lender.
    (vi) Under a standard repayment schedule, the borrower is scheduled 
to pay either--

[[Page 673]]

    (A) The same amount for each installment payment made during the 
repayment period, except that the borrower's final payment may be 
slightly more or less than the other payments; or
    (B) An installment amount that will be adjusted to reflect annual 
changes in the loan's variable interest rate.
    (vii) Under a graduated repayment schedule--
    (A)(1) The amount of the borrower's installment payment is scheduled 
to change (usually by increasing) during the course of the repayment 
period; or
    (2) If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, 
the lender may establish a repayment schedule that may have adjustments 
in the payment amount as provided under paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this 
section; and
    (B) An agreement as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the 
minimum annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (viii) Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule--
    (A)(1) The amount of the borrower's installment payment is adjusted 
annually, based on the borrower's expected total monthly gross income 
received by the borrower from employment and from other sources during 
the course of the repayment period; or
    (2) If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, 
the lender may establish a repayment schedule that may have adjustments 
in the payment amount as provided under paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this 
section; and
    (B) In general, the lender shall request the borrower to inform the 
lender of his or her income no earlier than 90 days prior to the due 
date of the borrower's initial installment payment and subsequent annual 
payment adjustment under an income-sensitive repayment schedule. The 
income information must be sufficient for the lender to make a 
reasonable determination of what the borrower's payment amount should 
be. If the lender receives late notification that the borrower has 
dropped below half-time enrollment status at a school, the lender may 
request that income information earlier than 90 days prior to the due 
date of the borrower's initial installment payment;
    (C) If the borrower reports income to the lender that the lender 
considers to be insufficient for establishing monthly installment 
payments that would repay the loan within the applicable maximum 
repayment period, the lender shall require the borrower to submit 
evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly gross 
income received by the borrower from employment and from other sources 
including, if applicable, pay statements from employers and 
documentation of any income received by the borrower from other parties;
    (D) The lender shall grant a forbearance to the borrower (or 
endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 5 years of payments in 
accordance with Sec. 682.211(i)(5) in cases where the effect of 
decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment 
schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum 
repayment term; and
    (E) The lender shall inform the borrower that the loan must be 
repaid within the time limits specified under paragraph (a)(8) of this 
section.
    (ix) Under an extended repayment schedule, a new borrower whose 
total outstanding principal and interest in FFEL loans exceed $30,000 
may repay the loan on a fixed annual repayment amount or a graduated 
repayment amount for a period that may not exceed 25 years. For purposes 
of this section, a ``new borrower'' is an individual who has no 
outstanding principal or interest balance on an FFEL Program loan as of 
October 7, 1998, or on the date he or she obtains an FFEL Program loan 
after October 7, 1998.
    (x) A borrower may request a change in the repayment schedule on a 
loan. The lender must permit the borrower to change the repayment 
schedule no less frequently than annually.
    (xi) For purposes of this section, a lender shall, to the extent 
practicable require that all FFEL loans owed by a borrower to the lender 
be combined into one account and repaid under one repayment schedule. In 
that event, the word ``loan'' in this section shall mean all of the 
borrower's loans that were

[[Page 674]]

combined by the lender into that account.
    (8)(i) Subject to paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) through (iv) of this 
section, and except as provided in paragraph (a)(7)(ix) a lender shall 
allow a borrower at least 5 years, but not more than 10 years, or 25 
years under an extended repayment plan to repay a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS 
loan, calculated from the beginning of the repayment period. Except in 
the case of a FISL loan for a period of enrollment beginning on or after 
July 1, 1986, the lender shall require a borrower to fully repay a FISL 
loan within 15 years after it is made.
    (ii) If the borrower receives an authorized deferment or is granted 
forbearance, as described in Sec. 682.210 or Sec. 682.211 respectively, 
the periods of deferment or forbearance are excluded from determinations 
of the 5-, 10-, and 15- and 25-year periods, and from the 10-, 12-, 15-, 
20-, 25-, and 30-year periods for repayment of a Consolidation loan 
pursuant to Sec. 682.209(h).
    (iii) If the minimum annual repayment required in paragraph (c) of 
this section would result in complete repayment of the loan in less than 
5 years, the borrower is not entitled to the full 5-year period.
    (iv) The borrower may, prior to the beginning of the repayment 
period, request and be granted by the lender a repayment period of less 
than 5 years. Subject to paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section, a 
borrower who makes such a request may, by written notice to the lender 
at any time during the repayment period, extend the repayment period to 
a minimum of 5 years.
    (9) If, with respect to the aggregate of all loans held by a lender, 
the total payment made by a borrower for a monthly or similar payment 
period would not otherwise be a multiple of five dollars, the lender may 
round that periodic payment to the next highest whole dollar amount that 
is a multiple of five dollars.
    (b) Payment application and prepayment. (1) The lender may credit 
the entire payment amount first to any late charges accrued or 
collection costs and then to any outstanding interest and then to 
outstanding principal.
    (2)(i) The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of a loan at 
any time without penalty.
    (ii) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds the monthly payment 
amount under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the lender 
shall apply the prepayment to future installments by advancing the next 
payment due date, unless the borrower requests otherwise. The lender 
must either inform the borrower in advance using a prominent statement 
in the borrower coupon book or billing statement that any additional 
full payment amounts submitted without instructions to the lender as to 
their handling will be applied to future scheduled payments with the 
borrower's next scheduled payment due date advanced consistent with the 
number of additional payments received, or provide a notification to the 
borrower after the payments are received informing the borrower that the 
payments have been so applied and the date of the borrower's next 
scheduled payment due date. Information related to next scheduled 
payment due date need not be provided to borrower's making such 
prepayments while in an in-school, grace, deferment, or forbearance 
period when payments are not due.
    (c) Minimum annual payment. (1)(i) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section and except as otherwise provided by a graduated, income-
sensitive, or extended repayment plan selected by the borrower, during 
each year of the repayment period, a borrower's total payments to all 
holders of the borrower's FFEL Program loans must total at least $600 or 
the unpaid balance of all loans, including interest, whichever amount is 
less.
    (ii) If the borrower and the lender agree, the amount paid may be 
less.
    (2) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section 
may not result in an extension of the maximum repayment period unless 
forbearance as described in Sec. 682.211, or deferment described in 
Sec. 682.210, has been approved.
    (d) Combined repayment of a borrower's student PLUS and SLS loans 
held by a lender. (1) A lender may, at the request of a student 
borrower, combine the borrower's, student PLUS and SLS loans

[[Page 675]]

held by it into a single repayment schedule.
    (2) The repayment period on the loans included in the combined 
repayment schedule must be calculated based on the beginning of 
repayment of the most recent included loan.
    (3) The interest rate on the loans included in the new combined 
repayment schedule must be the weighted average of the rates of all 
included loans.
    (e) Refinancing a fixed-rate PLUS or SLS Program loan to secure a 
variable interest rate. (1) Subject to paragraph (g) of this section, a 
lender may, at the request of a borrower, refinance a PLUS or SLS loan 
with a fixed interest rate in order to permit the borrower to obtain a 
variable interest rate.
    (2) A loan made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section--
    (i) Must bear interest at the variable rate described in 
Sec. 682.202(a)(2)(ii) and (3)(ii) as appropriate; and
    (ii) May not extend the repayment period provided for in paragraph 
(a)(8)(i) of this section.
    (3) The lender may not charge an additional insurance premium on the 
loan, but may charge the borrower an administrative fee pursuant to 
Sec. 682.202(e).
    (f) Refinancing of a fixed-rate PLUS or SLS Program loan to secure a 
variable interest rate by discharge of previous loan. (1) Subject to 
paragraph (g) of this section, a borrower who has applied for, but been 
denied, a refinanced loan authorized under paragraph (e) of this section 
by the holder of the borrower's fixed-rate PLUS or SLS loan, may obtain 
a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the fixed-rate 
loan and obtaining a variable interest rate.
    (2) A loan made under paragraph (f)(1) of this section--
    (i) Must bear interest at the variable interest rate described in 
Sec. 682.202(a)(2)(ii) and (3)(ii) as appropriate;
    (ii) May not operate to extend the repayment period provided for in 
paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section; and
    (iii) Must be disbursed to the holder of the fixed-rate loan to 
discharge the borrower's obligation thereon.
    (3) Upon receipt of the proceeds of a loan made under paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section, the holder of the fixed-rate loan shall, within 
five business days, apply the proceeds to discharge the borrower's 
obligation on the fixed-rate loan, and provide the refinancing lender 
with either a copy of the borrower's original promissory note evidencing 
the fixed-rate loan or the holder's written certification that the 
borrower's obligation on the fixed-rate loan has been fully discharged.
    (4) The refinancing lender may charge the borrower an insurance 
premium on a loan made under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, but may 
not charge a fee to cover administrative costs.
    (5) For purposes of deferments under Sec. 682.210, the refinancing 
loan--
    (i) Is considered a PLUS loan if any of the included loans is a PLUS 
loan made to a parent;
    (ii) Is considered an SLS loan if the combined loan does not include 
a PLUS loan made to a parent; or
    (iii) Is considered a loan to a ``new borrower'' as defined in 
Sec. 682.210(b)(7), if all the loans that were refinanced were made on 
or after July 1, 1987, for a period of enrollment beginning on or after 
that date.
    (g) Conditions for refinancing certain loans. (1) A lender may not 
refinance a loan under paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section if that

PLUS loan, is uninsured by the Secretary.
    (2)(i) Prior to refinancing a fixed-rate loan under paragraph (f) of

paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (B) The fixed-rate loan is eligible for insurance or reinsurance 
under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (ii) The holder of the fixed-rate loan shall, within 10 business 
days of receiving a lender's written request to provide a certification 
under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, provide the lender with that 
certification, or provide the lender and the guarantor on the loan with 
a written explanation of

    (ii) Is equal to or greater than $7,500 but less than $10,000, the 
borrower shall repay the Consolidation loan in not more than 12 years;

    (2)(i) If a lender receives a refund or a return of title IV, HEA

Sec. 682.210  Deferment.

    (a) General. (1)(i) A borrower is entitled to have periodic 
installment payments of principal deferred during authorized periods 
after the beginning of the repayment period, pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (ii) With the exception of a deferment authorized under paragraph 
(o) of this section, a borrower may continue to receive a specific type 
of deferment that is limited to a maximum period of time only if the 
total amount of time that the borrower has received the deferment does 
not exceed the maximum time period allowed for the deferment.
    (2)(i) For a loan made before October 1, 1981, the borrower is also 
entitled to have periodic installments of principal deferred during the 
six-month period (post-deferment grace period) that begins after the 
completion of each deferment period or combination of those periods, 
except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Once a borrower receives a post-deferment grace period 
following an unemployment deferment, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) 
of this section, the borrower does not qualify for additional post-
deferment grace periods following subsequent unemployment deferments.
    (3) Interest accrues and is paid by the borrower during the 
deferment period and the post-deferment grace period, if applicable, 
unless interest accrues and is paid by the Secretary for a Stafford loan 
and for all or a portion of a qualifying Consolidation loan that meets 
the requirements under Sec. 682.301.
    (4) As a condition for receiving a deferment, except for purposes of 
paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the borrower must 
request the deferment, and provide the lender with all information and 
documents required to establish eligibility for a specific type of 
deferment.
    (5) An authorized deferment period begins on the date that the 
holder determines is the date that the condition entitling the borrower 
to the deferment first existed, except that an initial unemployment 
deferment as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section cannot begin 
more than 6 months before the date the holder receives a request and 
documentation required for the deferment.
    (6) An authorized deferment period ends on the earlier of--
    (i) The date when the condition establishing the borrower's 
eligibility for the deferment ends;
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, the 
date on which, as certified by an authorized official, the borrower's 
eligibility for the deferment is expected to end;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, 
the expiration date of the period covered by any certification required 
by this section to be obtained for the deferment;
    (iv) In the case of an in-school deferment, the student's 
anticipated graduation date as certified by an authorized official of 
the school; or
    (v) The date when the condition providing the basis for the 
borrower's eligibility for the deferment has continued to exist for the 
maximum amount of time allowed for that type of deferment.
    (7) A lender may not deny a borrower a deferment to which the 
borrower is entitled, even though the borrower may be delinquent, but 
not in default, in making required installment payments. The 270- or 
330-day period required to establish default does not run during the 
deferment and post-deferment grace periods. Unless the lender has 
granted the borrower forbearance under Sec. 682.211, when the deferment 
and, if applicable, the post-deferment grace period expire, a borrower 
resumes any delinquency status that existed when the deferment period 
began.

[[Page 678]]

    (8) A borrower whose loan is in default is not eligible for a 
deferment on that loan, unless the borrower has made payment 
arrangements acceptable to the lender prior to the payment of a default 
claim by a guaranty agency.
    (9) The borrower promptly must inform the lender when the condition 
entitling the borrower to a deferment no longer exists.
    (10) Authorized deferments are described in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Specific requirements for each deferment are set forth in 
paragraphs (c) through (s) of this section.
    (11) If two individuals are jointly liable for repayment of a PLUS 
loan or a Consolidation loan, the lender shall grant a request for 
deferment if both individuals simultaneously meet the requirements of 
this section for receiving the same, or different deferments.
    (b) Authorized deferments. (1) Deferment is authorized for a FFEL 
borrower during any period when the borrower is--
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, engaged 
in full-time study at a school, or at a school that is operated by the 
Federal Government (e.g., the service academies), unless the borrower is 
not a national of the United States and is pursuing a course of study at 
a school not located in a State;
    (ii) Engaged in a course of study under an eligible graduate 
fellowship program;
    (iii) Engaged in a rehabilitation training program for disabled 
individuals;
    (iv) Temporarily totally disabled, or unable to secure employment 
because the borrower is caring for a spouse or other dependent who is 
disabled and requires continuous nursing or similar services for up to 
three years; or
    (v) Conscientiously seeking, but unable to find, full-time 
employment in the United States, for up to two years.
    (2) For a borrower of a Stafford or SLS loan, and for a parent 
borrower of a PLUS loan made before August 15, 1983, deferment is 
authorized during any period when the borrower is--
    (i) On active duty status in the United States Armed Forces, or an 
officer in the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health 
Service, for up to three years (including any period during which the 
borrower received a deferment authorized under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of 
this section);
    (ii) A full-time volunteer under the Peace Corps Act, for up to 
three years;
    (iii) A full-time volunteer under title I of the Domestic Volunteer

    (4) In the case of a FFEL borrower, the lender shall treat a 
certified loan application or other form certified by the school or for

rehabilitation training program for disabled individuals.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an eligible 
rehabilitation training program for disabled individuals is a program 
that--

providing rehabilitation training to disabled individuals by--
    (A) A State agency with responsibility for vocational rehabilitation 
programs;
    (B) A State agency with responsibility for drug abuse treatment 
programs;

    (B) Specifies the date on which the services to the borrower are 
expected to end; and
    (C) Is structured in a way that requires a substantial commitment by 
the borrower to his or her rehabilitation. The Secretary considers a 
substantial commitment by the borrower to be a commitment of time and 
effort that normally would prevent an individual from engaging in full-
time employment, either because of the number of hours that must be 
devoted to rehabilitation or because of the nature of the 
rehabilitation. For the purpose of this paragraph, full-time employment 
involves at least 30 hours of work per week and is expected to last at 
least three months.
    (f) Temporary total disability deferment. (1) To qualify for a 
temporary total disability deferment, a borrower shall provide the

basis of a condition that existed before he or she applied for the loan, 
unless the condition has substantially deteriorated so as to render the 
borrower temporarily totally disabled, as substantiated by the statement 
required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, after the borrower 
submitted the loan application.
    (3) A lender may not grant a deferment based on a single 
certification under paragraph (f)(1) of this section beyond the date 
that is six months after the date of certification.
    (g) Dependent's disability deferment. (1) To qualify for a deferment 
given to a borrower whose spouse or other dependent requires continuous 
nursing or similar services for a period of at least 90 days, the 
borrower shall provide the lender with a statement--

least 30 hours of work per week and is expected to last at least three 
months.

certification under paragraph (g)(1) of this section beyond the date

unemployment deferment by providing evidence of eligibility for

to describe his or her search for full-time employment at the time the 
deferment is granted. The initial period of unemployment deferment can 
be granted for a period of unemployment beginning up to 6 months before 
the date the holder receives the borrower's request and documentation 
for the deferment, and can be granted for up to 6 months after that 
date. For a continuation of an unemployment deferment following the 
initial period, the borrower's written certification must include 
information showing that the borrower made at least six diligent 
attempts to secure employment to support the prior 6-month period 
covered by the certification. This information could be the name of the 
employer contacted and the employer's address and telephone number, or 
other information acceptable to the holder showing that the borrower 
made six diligent attempts to obtain full-time employment;
    (ii) Setting forth the borrower's latest permanent home address and, 
if applicable, the borrower's latest temporary address; and
    (iii) Affirming that the borrower has registered with a public or 
private employment agency, if one is within a 50-mile radius of the 
borrower's permanent or temporary address, specifying the agency's name 
and address and date of registration.
    (3) For purposes of obtaining an unemployment deferment under 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the following rules apply:
    (i) A borrower may qualify for an unemployment deferment whether or 
not the borrower has been previously employed.
    (ii) An unemployment deferment is not justified if the borrower 
refuses to seek or accept employment in kinds of positions or at salary 
and responsibility levels for which the borrower feels overqualified by 
virtue of education or previous experience.
    (iii) Full-time employment involves at least 30 hours of work a week 
and is expected to last at least three months.
    (iv) A lender may accept, as an alternative to the certification of 
employer contacts required under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, 
comparable documentation the borrower has used to meet the requirements 
of the Unemployment Insurance Service, if it shows the same number of 
contacts and contains the same information the borrower would be 
required to provide under this section.
    (4) A lender may not grant a deferment based on a single 
certification under paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section beyond 
the date that is six months after the date the borrower provides 
evidence of the borrower's eligibility for unemployment insurance 
benefits under paragraph (h)(1) of this section or the date the borrower 
provides the written certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section.
    (i) Military deferment. (1) To qualify for a military deferment, a

borrower is teaching in a teacher shortage area designated by the 
Secretary, a borrower must do one of the following:

[[Page 684]]

    (i) If the borrower is teaching in a State in which the Chief State 
School Officer has complied with paragraph (q)(3) of this section and 
provides an annual listing of designated teacher shortage areas to the 
State's chief administrative officers whose schools are affected by the 
Secretary's designations, the borrower may obtain a certification that 
he or she is teaching in a teacher shortage area from his or her 
school's chief administrative officer.
    (ii) If a borrower is teaching in a State in which the Chief State 
School Officer has not complied with paragraph (q)(3) of this section or 
does not provide an annual listing of designated teacher shortage areas 
to the State's chief administrative officers whose schools are affected 
by the Secretary's designations, the borrower must obtain certification 
that he or she is teaching in a teacher shortage area from the Chief 
State School Officer for the State in which the borrower is teaching.
    (3) In the case of a State in which borrowers wish to obtain 
certifications as provided for in paragraph (q)(2)(i) of this section, 
the State's Chief State School Officer must first have notified the 
Secretary, by means of a one-time written assurance, that he or she 
provides annually to the State's chief administrative officers whose 
schools are affected by the Secretary's designations and the guaranty 
agency for that State, a listing of the teacher shortage areas 
designated by the Secretary as provided for in paragraphs (q) (5) 
through (7) of this section.
    (4) If a borrower who receives a deferment continues to teach in the 
same teacher shortage area as that in which he or she was teaching when 
the deferment was originally granted, the borrower shall, at the 
borrower's request, continue to receive the deferment for those 
subsequent years, up to the three-year maximum deferment period, even if 
his or her position does not continue to be within an area designated by 
the Secretary as a teacher shortage area in those subsequent years. To 
continue to receive the deferment in a subsequent year under this 
paragraph, the borrower shall provide the lender with a statement by the 
chief administrative officer of the public or nonprofit private 
elementary or secondary school that employs the borrower, certifying 
that the borrower continues to be employed as a full-time teacher in the 
same teacher shortage area for which the deferment was received for the 
previous year.
    (5) For purposes of this section a teacher shortage area is--
    (i)(A) A geographic region of the State in which there is a shortage 
of elementary or secondary school teachers; or
    (B) A specific grade level or academic, instructional, subject-
matter, or discipline classification in which there is a statewide 
shortage of elementary or secondary school teachers; and
    (ii) Designated by the Secretary under paragraphs (q)(6) or (q)(7) 
of this section.
    (6)(i) In order for the Secretary to designate one or more teacher 
shortage areas in a State for a school year, the Chief State School 
Officer shall by January 1 of the calendar year in which the school year 
begins, and in accordance with objective written standards, propose 
teacher shortage areas to the Secretary for designation. With respect to 
private nonprofit schools included in the recommendation, the Chief 
State School Officer shall consult with appropriate officials of the 
private nonprofit schools in the State prior to submitting the 
recommendation.
    (ii) In identifying teacher shortage areas to propose for 
designation under paragraph (q)(6)(i) of this section, the Chief State 
School Officer shall consider data from the school year in which the 
recommendation is to be made, unless that data is not yet available, in 
which case he or she may use data from the immediately preceding school 
year, with respect to--
    (A) Teaching positions that are unfilled;
    (B) Teaching positions that are filled by teachers who are certified 
by irregular, provisional, temporary, or emergency certification; and
    (C) Teaching positions that are filled by teachers who are 
certified, but who are teaching in academic subject areas other than 
their area of preparation.
    (iii) If the total number of unduplicated full-time equivalent

[[Page 685]]

(FTE) elementary or secondary teaching positions identified under 
paragraph (q)(6)(ii) of this section in the shortage areas proposed by 
the State for designation does not exceed 5 percent of the total number 
of FTE elementary and secondary teaching positions in the State, the 
Secretary designates those areas as teacher shortage areas.
    (iv) If the total number of unduplicated FTE elementary and 
secondary teaching positions identified under paragraph (q)(6)(ii) of 
this section in the shortage areas proposed by the State for designation 
exceeds 5 percent of the total number of elementary and secondary FTE 
teaching positions in the State, the Chief State School Officer shall 
submit, with the list of proposed areas, supporting documentation 
showing the methods used for identifying shortage areas, and an 
explanation of the reasons why the Secretary should nevertheless 
designate all of the proposed areas as teacher shortage areas. The 
explanation must include a ranking of the proposed shortage areas 
according to priority, to assist the Secretary in determining which 
areas should be designated. The Secretary, after considering the 
explanation, determines which shortage areas to designate as teacher 
shortage areas.
    (7) A Chief State School Officer may submit to the Secretary for 
approval an alternative written procedure to the one described in 
paragraph (q)(6) of this section, for the Chief State School Officer to 
use to select the teacher shortage areas recommended to the Secretary 
for designation, and for the Secretary to use to choose the areas to be 
designated. If the Secretary approves the proposed alternative 
procedure, in writing, that procedure, once approved, may be used 
instead of the procedure described in paragraph (q)(6) of this section 
for designation of teacher shortage areas in that State.
    (8) For purposes of paragraphs (q)(1) through (7) of this section--
    (i) The definition of the term school in Sec. 682.200(b) does not 
apply;
    (ii) Elementary school means a day or residential school that 
provides elementary education, as determined under State law;
    (iii) Secondary school means a day or residential school that 
provides secondary education, as determined under State law. In the 
absence of applicable State law, the Secretary may determine, with 
respect to that State, whether the term ``secondary school'' includes 
education beyond the twelfth grade;
    (iv) Teacher means a professional who provides direct and personal 
services to students for their educational development through classroom 
teaching;
    (v) Chief State School Officer means the highest ranking educational 
official for elementary and secondary education for the State;
    (vi) School year means the period from July 1 of a calendar year 
through June 30 of the following calendar year;
    (vii) Teacher shortage area means an area of specific grade, subject 
matter, or discipline classification, or a geographic area in which the 
Secretary determines that there is an inadequate supply of elementary or 
secondary school teachers; and
    (viii) Full-time equivalent means the standard used by a State in 
defining full-time employment, but not less than 30 hours per week. For 
purposes of counting full-time equivalent teacher positions, a teacher 
working part of his or her total hours in a position that is designated 
as a teacher shortage area is counted on a pro rata basis corresponding 
to the percentage of his or her working hours spent in such a position.
    (r) Working-mother deferment. (1) To qualify for the working-mother 
deferment described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section, the 
borrower shall provide the lender with a statement certifying that she--
    (i) Is the mother of a preschool-age child;
    (ii) Entered or reentered the workforce not more than one year

of this section, the borrower shall provide to the lender documents 
demonstrating the age of her child (e.g., a birth certificate) and the 
rate of her compensation (e.g., a pay stub showing her hourly rate of

through (v) of this section, the lender shall count only the monthly 
payment amount (or a proportional share if the payments are due less 
frequently than monthly) that would have been owed on a Federal 
postsecondary education loan if the loan had been scheduled to be repaid 
in 10 years from the date the borrower entered repayment, regardless of 
the length of the borrower's actual repayment schedule or the actual 
monthly payment amount (if any) that would be owed during the period 
that the borrower requested an economic hardship deferment. The lender

require the borrower to submit--
    (A) Evidence showing the amount of the borrower's monthly income or 
a copy of the borrower's most recently filed Federal income tax return; 
and
    (B) For periods of deferment under paragraphs (s)(6)(iv) and (v) of

amount of the monthly payments to all other entities for Federal 
postsecondary education loans that would have been owed by the borrower 
during the deferment period.
    (x) For purposes of paragraph (s)(6) of this section, a borrower's 
monthly income is the gross amount of income received by the borrower 
from employment and from other sources, or one-twelfth of the borrower's 
adjusted gross income, as recorded on the borrower's most recently filed 
Federal income tax return.
    (xi) For purposes of paragraph (s)(6) of this section, a borrower is 
considered to be working full-time if the borrower is expected to be 
employed for at least three consecutive months at 30 hours per week.

Sec. 682.211  Forbearance.

    (a)(1) The Secretary encourages a lender to grant forbearance for 
the benefit of a borrower or endorser in order to prevent the borrower 
or endorser from defaulting on the borrower's or endorser's repayment 
obligation, or to permit the borrower or endorser to resume honoring 
that obligation after default. Forbearance means permitting the 
temporary cessation of payments, allowing an extension of time for 
making payments, or temporarily accepting smaller payments than 
previously were scheduled.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (g) of this section, a lender may grant 
forbearance of payments of principal and interest under paragraphs (b), 
(c), and (d) of this section only if--
    (i) The lender reasonably believes, and documents in the borrower's 
file, that the borrower or endorser intends to repay the loan but, due 
to poor health or other acceptable reasons, is currently unable to make 
scheduled payments; or
    (ii) The borrower's payments of principal are deferred under 
Sec. 682.210 and

[[Page 688]]

the Secretary does not pay interest benefits on behalf of the borrower 
under Sec. 682.301.
    (3) If two individuals are jointly liable for repayment of a PLUS 
loan or a Consolidation loan, the lender may grant forbearance on 
repayment of the loan only if the ability of both individuals to make 
scheduled payments has been impaired based on the same or differing 
conditions.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(9) of this section, if 
payments of interest are forborne, they may be capitalized as provided 
in Sec. 682.202(b).
    (b) A lender may grant forbearance if the lender and the borrower or 
endorser agree in writing to the terms of the forbearance, or, in the 
case of forbearance of interest during a period of deferment, if the 
lender informs the borrower at the time the deferment is granted that 
interest payments are to be forborne.
    (c) A lender may grant forbearance for a period of up to one year at 
a time if both the borrower or endorser and an authorized official of 
the lender agree in writing to the terms of the forbearance.
    (d) A guaranty agency may authorize a lender to grant forbearance to 
permit a borrower or endorser to resume honoring the agreement to repay 
the debt after default but prior to claim payment. The terms of the 
forbearance agreement in this situation must include a new signed 
agreement to repay the debt.
    (e) Except in the case of forbearance of interest payments during a 
deferment period if a forbearance involves the postponement of all 
payments, the lender must contact the borrower or endorser by telephone 
or send a written notice to the borrower or endorser at least once every 
three months during the period of forbearance to remind the borrower or 
endorser of the outstanding obligation to repay.
    (f) A lender may grant forbearance, upon notice to the borrower or 
if applicable, the endorser, with respect to payments of interest and 
principal that are overdue--
    (1) For a properly granted period of deferment for which the lender 
learns the borrower did not qualify;
    (2) Upon the beginning of an authorized deferment period under 
Sec. 682.210, or an administrative forbearance period as specified under 
paragraph (f)(10) or (i)(2) of this section;
    (3) For the period beginning when the borrower entered repayment 
until the first payment due date was established;
    (4) For the period prior to the borrower's filing of a bankruptcy 
petition as provided in Sec. 682.402(f).
    (5) For the periods described in Sec. 682.402(c) in regard to the 
borrower's total and permanent disability;
    (6) For a period not to exceed an additional 60 days after the 
lender has suspended collection activity for the initial 60-day period 
required pursuant to Sec. 682.211(i)(6) and Sec. 682.402(b)(3), when the 
lender receives reliable information that the borrower (or student in 
the case of a PLUS loan) has died;
    (7) For periods necessary for the Secretary or guaranty agency to 
determine the borrower's eligibility for discharge of the loan because 
of an unpaid refund, attendance at a closed school or false 
certification of loan eligibility, pursuant to Sec. 682.402(d) or (e), 
or the borrower's or, if applicable, endorser's bankruptcy, pursuant to 
Sec. 682.402(f); or
    (8) For a period of delinquency at the time a loan is sold or 
transferred, if the borrower or endorser is less than 60 days delinquent 
on the loan at the time of sale or transfer.
    (9) For a period of delinquency that may remain after a borrower 
ends a period of deferment or mandatory forbearance until the next due 
date, which can be no later than 45 days after the period ends.
    (10) For a period not to exceed 60 days necessary for the lender to 
collect and process documentation supporting the borrower's request for 
a deferment, forbearance, change in repayment plan, or consolidation 
loan. Interest that accrues during this period is not capitalized.
    (11) For a period not to exceed 3 months for a borrower who is 
affected by a natural disaster.
    (g) In granting a forbearance under this section, except for a 
forbearance under paragraph (i)(5) of this section, a

lender shall grant a temporary cessation of payments, unless the 
borrower chooses another form of forbearance subject to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (h) Mandatory forbearance. (1) Medical or dental interns or 
residents. Upon receipt of a request and sufficient supporting 
documentation, as described in Sec. 682.210(n), from a borrower serving 
in a medical or dental internship or residency program, a lender shall 
grant forbearance to the borrower in yearly increments (or a lesser 
period equal to the actual period during which the borrower is eligible) 
if the borrower has exhausted his or her eligibility for a deferment 
under Sec. 682.210(n), or the borrower's promissory note does not 
provide for such a deferment--
    (i) For the length of time remaining in the borrower's medical or 
dental internship or residency that must be successfully completed 
before the borrower may begin professional practice or service; or
    (ii) For the length of time that the borrower is serving in a 
medical or dental internship or residency program leading to a degree or 
certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, 
or a health care facility that offers postgraduate training.
    (2) Borrowers who are not medical or dental interns or residents, 
and endorsers. Upon receipt of a request and sufficient supporting 
documentation from an endorser (if applicable), or from a borrower 
(other than a borrower who is serving in a medical or dental internship 
or residency described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section), a lender 
shall grant forbearance--
    (i) In increments up to one year, for periods that collectively do 
not exceed three years, if--
    (A) The borrower or endorser is currently obligated to make payments 
on Title IV loans; and
    (B) The amount of those payments each month (or a proportional share 
if the payments are due less frequently than monthly) is collectively 
equal to or greater than 20 percent of the borrower's or endorser's 
total monthly income;
    (ii) In yearly increments (or a lesser period equal to the actual 
period during which the borrower is eligible) for as long as a borrower-
-
    (A) Is serving in a national service position for which the borrower 
receives a national service educational award under the National and 
Community Service Trust Act of 1993;
    (B) Is performing the type of service that would qualify the 
borrower for a partial repayment of his or her loan under the Student 
Loan Repayment Programs administered by the Department of Defense under 
10 U.S.C. 2171; or
    (C) Is performing the type of service that would qualify the 
borrower for loan forgiveness and associated forbearance under the 
requirements of the teacher loan forgiveness program in Sec. 682.215.
    (3) Documentation. (i) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower 
or endorser under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, the lender shall

borrower or endorser to other entities for the most recent month for the 
borrower's or endorser's Title IV loans.

paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the lender shall require the 
borrower or endorser to submit documentation showing the beginning and 
ending dates that the Department of Defense considers the borrower to be 
eligible for a partial repayment of his or her loan under the Student 
Loan Repayment Programs.
    (iii) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower under paragraph 
(h)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the lender must require the borrower to--
    (A) Submit documentation for the period of the annual forbearance 
request showing the beginning and anticipated ending dates that the 
borrower is expected to perform, for that year, the type of service 
described in Sec. 682.215(c); and
    (B) Certify the borrower's intent to satisfy the requirements of 
Sec. 682.215(c).

[[Page 690]]

    (i) Mandatory administrative forbearance. (1) The lender shall grant 
a mandatory administrative forbearance for the periods specified in 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section until the lender is notified by the 
Secretary or a guaranty agency that the forbearance period no longer 
applies. The lender may not require a borrower who is eligible for a 
forbearance under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section to submit a 
request or supporting documentation, but shall require a borrower (or 
endorser, if applicable) who requests forbearance because of a military 
mobilization to provide documentation showing that he or she is subject 
to a military mobilization as described in paragraph (i)(4) of this 
section.
    (2) The lender is not required to notify the borrower (or endorser, 
if applicable) at the time the forbearance is granted, but shall grant a 
forbearance to a borrower or endorser during a period, and the 30 days 
following the period, when the lender is notified by the Secretary that-
-
    (i) Exceptional circumstances exist, such as a local or national 
emergency or military mobilization; or

has been designated a disaster area by the president of the United 
States or Mexico, the Prime Minister of Canada, or by a Governor of a 
State.

the lender shall notify the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) that 
the lender has granted a forbearance and the date that payments should 
resume. The lender's notification shall state that the borrower or 
endorser--
    (i) May decline the forbearance and continue to be obligated to make 
scheduled payments; or
    (ii) Consents to making payments in accordance with the lender's 
notification if the forbearance is not declined.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, the term 
``military mobilization'' shall mean a situation in which the Department 
of Defense orders members of the National Guard or Reserves to active 
duty under sections 688, 12301(a), 12301(g), 12302, 12304, and 12306 of 
title 10, United States Code. This term also includes the assignment of 
other members of the Armed Forces to duty stations at locations other 
than the locations at which they were normally assigned, only if the 
military mobilization involved the activation of the National Guard or 
Reserves.
    (5) The lender shall grant a mandatory administrative forbearance to 
a borrower (or endorser, if applicable) during a period when the 
borrower (or endorser, if applicable) is making payments for a period 
of--
    (i) Up to 3 years of payments in cases where the effect of a 
variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule 
would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment 
term; or
    (ii) Up to 5 years of payments in cases where the effect of 
decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment 
schedule would result in the loan not being repaid within the maximum 
repayment term.

a borrower for a period not to exceed 60 days after the lender receives 
reliable information indicating that the borrower (or student in the

of death pursuant to Sec. 682.402(b)(3).

    (d) Except to secure a loan from the Student Loan Marketing 
Association or an agency of a State functioning as a secondary market or

Sec. 682.215  Teacher loan forgiveness program.

    (a) General. The teacher loan forgiveness program is intended to 
encourage individuals to enter and continue in the teaching profession. 
For new borrowers, the Secretary repays up to a combined total of $5,000 
of subsidized and unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Direct Subsidized 
Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and in certain cases, Federal 
Consolidation Loans or Direct Consolidation Loans. The forgiveness 
program is only available to a borrower who has no outstanding loan 
balance under the FFEL Program or the Direct Loan Program on October 1, 
1998 or who has no outstanding loan balance on the date he or she 
obtains a loan after October 1, 1998. In addition, the borrower must 
have been employed as a full-time teacher for five consecutive complete 
academic years, at least one of which was after the 1997-1998 academic 
year, in certain eligible elementary or secondary schools that serve 
low-income families. The loan for which forgiveness is sought must have 
been made prior to the end of the borrower's fifth year of qualifying 
teaching service.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:
    Academic year means one complete school year at the same school, or 
two complete and consecutive half years at different schools, or two 
complete and consecutive half years from different school years at 
either the same school or different schools. Half years exclude summer 
sessions and generally fall within a twelve-month period. For schools 
that have a year-round program of instruction, a minimum of nine months 
is considered an academic year.
    Elementary school means a public or nonprofit private school that 
provides elementary education as determined by State law or the 
Secretary if that school is not in a State.
    Full-time means the standard used by a State in defining full-time 
employment as a teacher. For a borrower teaching in more than one 
school, the determination of full-time is based on the combination of

children who qualify for services provided under title I; and
    (iii) Is listed in the Annual Directory of Designated Low-Income 
Schools for Teacher Cancellation Benefits. If this directory is not 
available before May 1 of any year, the previous year's directory may be 
used.
    (2) If the school at which the borrower is employed meets the 
requirements specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for at least 
one year of the borrower's five consecutive complete academic years of 
teaching and the school fails to meet those requirements in subsequent 
years, those subsequent years of teaching qualify for purposes of this 
section for that borrower.
    (3) A borrower who is employed as an elementary school teacher must 
demonstrate knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, 
mathematics, and other areas of the elementary school curriculum, as 
certified by the chief

[[Page 693]]

administrative officer of the school in which the borrower was employed.

condition, or military active duty as described in paragraph (c)(5) of 
this section, including the time necessary for the borrower to resume 
qualifying teaching no later than the beginning of the next regularly

five consecutive years of qualifying teaching service.
    (7) A borrower who taught in more than one qualifying school during 
an academic year and demonstrates that the combined teaching was the 
equivalent of full-time, as supported by the certification of one or 
more of the chief administrative officers of the schools involved, is 
considered to have completed one academic year of qualifying teaching.
    (8) A borrower is not eligible for teacher loan forgiveness on a 
defaulted loan unless the borrower has made satisfactory repayment 
arrangements to re-establish title IV eligibility, as defined in 
Sec. 682.200.
    (9) A borrower may not receive loan forgiveness for qualifying

subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Stafford or Federal Consolidation 
Loan obligation that is outstanding after the borrower completes his or 
her fifth consecutive complete academic year of teaching as described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. Only the outstanding portion of the 
consolidation loan that was used to repay an eligible subsidized or 
unsubsidized Federal Stafford loan, an eligible Direct Subsidized Loan, 
or an eligible Direct Unsubsidized Loan qualifies for loan forgiveness 
under this section.
    (2) A borrower may not receive more than a total of $5,000 in loan 
forgiveness for outstanding principal and accrued interest under both 
this section and under section 34 CFR 685.217.
    (3) The holder does not refund payments that were received from or 
on behalf of a borrower who qualifies for loan forgiveness under this

    (i) Under Sec. 682.211(h)(2)(ii)(C) and (h)(3)(iii), in annual 
increments for each of the years of qualifying teaching service, if the 
holder believes, at the time of the borrower's annual request, that the 
expected cancellation amount will satisfy the anticipated remaining 
outstanding balance on the loan at the time of the expected 
cancellation;
    (ii) For a period not to exceed 60 days while the holder is awaiting 
a completed teacher loan forgiveness application from the borrower; and
    (iii) For the period beginning on the date the holder receives a 
completed loan forgiveness application to the date the holder receives 
either a denial of the request or the loan discharge amount from the 
guaranty agency, in

[[Page 694]]

accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) At the conclusion of a forbearance authorized under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, the holder must resume collection activities and 
may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during the forbearance 
period in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b).
    (3) Nothing in paragraph (e) of this section restricts holders from 
offering other forbearance options to borrowers who do not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
    (f) Application and processing. (1) A borrower, after completing the 
qualifying teaching service, requests loan forgiveness from the holder 
of the loan on a form approved by the Secretary.
    (2)(i) The holder must file a request for payment with the guaranty 
agency on a teacher forgiveness discharge no later than 60 days after 
the receipt, from the borrower, of a completed teacher loan forgiveness 
application.
    (ii) When filing a request for payment on a teacher forgiveness 
discharge, the holder must provide the guaranty agency with the 
completed loan forgiveness application submitted by the borrower and any 
required supporting documentation.
    (iii) If the holder files a request for payment later than 60 days 
after the receipt of the completed teacher loan forgiveness application 
form, interest that accrued on the discharged amount after the 
expiration of the 60-day filing period is ineligible for reimbursement 
by the Secretary, and the holder must repay all interest and special 
allowance received on the discharged amount for periods after the 
expiration of the 60-day filing period. The holder cannot collect from 
the borrower any interest that is not paid by the Secretary under this 
paragraph.
    (3)(i) Within 45 days of receiving the holder's request for payment, 
the guaranty agency must determine if the borrower meets the eligibility 
requirements for loan forgiveness under this section and must notify the 
holder of its determination of the borrower's eligibility for loan 
forgiveness under this section.
    (ii) If the guaranty agency approves the discharge, it must, within 
the same 45-day period, pay the holder the amount of the discharge, up 
to $5,000, subject to paragraphs (c)(9), (d)(1), (d)(2) and (f)(2)(iii) 
of this section.
    (4) After being notified by the guaranty agency of its determination 
of the eligibility of the borrower for the discharge, the holder must, 
within 30 days, inform the borrower of the determination. If the 
discharge is approved, the holder must also provide the borrower with 
information regarding any new repayment terms of remaining loan 
balances.
    (5) Unless otherwise instructed by the borrower, the holder must 
apply the proceeds of the teacher forgiveness discharge first to any 
outstanding unsubsidized Federal Stafford loan balances, next to any 
outstanding subsidized Federal Stafford loan balances, then to any 
eligible outstanding Federal Consolidation loan balances.
    (g) Claims for reimbursement from the Secretary on loans held by 
guaranty agencies. In the case of a teacher loan forgiveness discharge 
applied to a defaulted loan held by the guaranty agency, the Secretary 
pays the guaranty agency a percentage of the amount discharged that is 
equal to the complement of the reinsurance percentage paid on the loan. 
The payment of up to $5,000 may also include interest that accrues on 
the discharged amount during the period from the date on which the 
guaranty agency received payment from the Secretary on a default claim 
to the date on which the guaranty agency determines that the borrower is 
eligible for the teacher loan forgiveness discharge.

the Act.
    (2) The Secretary considers a member of a religious order, group,

Sec. 682.303  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 682.304  Methods for computing interest benefits and special allowance.

    (a) General. The Secretary pays a lender interest benefits and 
special allowance on eligible loans on a quarterly basis. These calendar 
quarters end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each 
year. A lender may use either the average daily balance method or the 
actual accrual method to determine the amount of interest benefits 
payable on a lender's loans. A lender shall use the average daily 
balance method to determine the balance on which the Secretary computes 
the amount of special allowance payable on its loans.
    (b) Average daily balance method for interest benefits. (1) Under 
this method, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on 
all loans qualifying for interest benefits at each actual interest rate 
for each day of the quarter, divides the sum by the number of days in 
the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The 
resulting figure is the average daily balance for qualified loans 
outstanding at each actual interest rate.
    (2) The Secretary computes the interest benefits due on all 
qualified loans at each actual interest rate by multiplying the average 
daily balance thereof by the actual interest rate, multiplying this 
result by the number of days in the quarter, and then dividing this 
result by the actual number of days in the year.
    (c) Actual accrual method for interest benefits. (1) Under this 
method, the lender computes the total unpaid principal balance 
outstanding on all qualified loans at each actual interest rate on each 
day of the quarter, multiplies this result by the actual interest rate, 
and divides this result by the actual number of days in the year, or, 
alternatively, 365.25 days. A lender who chooses to divide by 365.25 
days must do so for four consecutive years.
    (2) The interest benefits due for a quarter equal the sum of the 
daily interest benefits due, computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, for each day of the quarter.
    (d) Average daily balance method for special allowance. (1) To 
compute the average daily balance outstanding for purposes of special 
allowance, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on 
all qualified loans at each applicable interest rate for each day of the 
quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and 
rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is 
the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at each 
applicable interest rate.
    (2) The Secretary computes the special allowance payable to a lender 
based upon the average daily balance computed by the lender under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 682.305  Procedures for payment of interest benefits and special allowance and collection of origination and loan fees.

    (a) General. (1) If a lender owes origination fees or loan fees 
under paragraph (a) of this section, it must submit quarterly reports to 
the Secretary on a form provided or prescribed by the Secretary, even if 
the lender is not owed, or does not wish to receive, interest benefits 
or special allowance from the Secretary.
    (2) The lender shall report, on the quarterly report required by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amount of origination fees it was 
authorized to collect and the amount of those fees refunded to borrowers 
during the quarter covered by the report.
    (3)(i)(A) The Secretary reduces the amount of interest benefits and 
special allowance payable to the lender by--
    (1) The amount of origination fees the lender was authorized to 
collect during the quarter under Sec. 682.202(c), whether or not the 
lender actually collected that amount; and
    (2) The amount of lender fees payable under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section.
    (B) The Secretary increases the amount of interest benefits and 
special allowance payable to the lender by the amount of origination 
fees refunded to borrowers during the quarter under Sec. 682.202(c).
    (ii) For any FFEL loan made on or after October 1, 1993, a lender 
shall pay the Secretary a loan fee equal to 0.50% of the principal 
amount of the loan.
    (iii) The Secretary collects from an originating lender the amount 
of origination fees the originating lender was authorized to collect 
from borrowers during the quarter whether or not the originating lender 
actually collected those fees. The Secretary also collects the fees the 
originating lender is required to pay under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section. Generally, the Secretary collects the fees from the originating 
lender by offsetting the amount of interest benefits and special 
allowance payable to the originating lender in a quarter, and, if 
necessary, the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable 
in subsequent quarters may be offset until the total amount of fees has 
been recovered.
    (iv) If the full amount of the fees cannot be collected within two 
quarters by reducing interest and special allowance payable to the 
originating lender, the Secretary may collect the unpaid amount directly 
from the originating lender.
    (v) If the full amount of the fees cannot be collected within two 
quarters from the originating lender in accordance with paragraphs 
(a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section and if the originating lender has 
transferred the loan to a subsequent holder, the Secretary may, 
following written notice, collect the unpaid amount from the holder by 
using the same steps described in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of 
this section, with the term ``holder'' substituting for the term 
``originating lender''.
    (4) If an originating lender sells or otherwise transfers a loan to 
a new holder, the originating lender remains liable to the Secretary for 
payment of the origination fees. The Secretary will not pay interest 
benefits or special allowance to the new holder or pay reinsurance to 
the guaranty agency until the origination fees are paid to the 
Secretary.
    (b) Penalty interest. (1)(i) If the Secretary does not pay interest 
benefits or the special allowance within 30 days after the Secretary 
receives an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from a 
lender, the Secretary pays the lender penalty interest.
    (ii) The payment of interest benefits or special allowance is deemed 
to occur, for purposes of this paragraph, when the Secretary--
    (A) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the lender;
    (B) Credits the payment due the lender against a debt that the 
Secretary determines is owed the Secretary by the lender; or
    (C) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the amount due by the 
lender to another Federal agency for credit against a debt that the 
Federal agency has determined the lender owes.
    (2) Penalty interest is an amount that accrues daily on interest 
benefits

[[Page 701]]

and special allowance due to the lender. The penalty interest is 
computed by--
    (i) Multiplying the daily interest rate applicable to loans on which 
payment for interest benefits was requested, by the amount of interest 
benefits due on those loans for each interest rate;
    (ii) Multiplying the daily special allowance rate applicable to 
loans on which special allowance was requested by the amount of special 
allowance due on those loans for each interest rate and special 
allowance category;
    (iii) Adding the results of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section to determine the gross penalty interest to be paid for each day 
that penalty interest is due;
    (iv) Dividing the results of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section 
by the gross amount of interest benefits and special allowance due to 
obtain the average penalty interest rate;
    (v) Multiplying the rate obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this 
section by the total amount of reduction to gross interest benefits and 
special allowance due (e.g., origination fees or other debts owed to the 
Federal Government);
    (vi) Subtracting the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of 
this section from the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section to obtain the net amount of penalty interest due per day; 
and
    (vii) Multiplying the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of 
this section by the number of days calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) The Secretary pays penalty interest for the period--
    (i) Beginning on the later of--
    (A) The 31st day after the final day of the quarter covered by the 
request for payment; or
    (B) The 31st day after the Secretary's receipt of an accurate, 
timely, and complete request for payment from the lender; and
    (ii) Ending on the day the Secretary pays the interest benefits and 
the special allowance at issue, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (4) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is 
considered timely only if it is received by the Secretary within 90 days 
following the end of the quarter to which the request pertains.
    (5) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is not 
considered accurate and complete if it--
    (i) Requests payments to which the lender is not entitled under 
Secs. 682.300 through 682.302;
    (ii) Includes loans that the Secretary, in writing, has directed 
that the lender exclude from the request;
    (iii) Does not contain all information required by the Secretary or 
contains conflicting information; or
    (iv) Is not provided and certified on the form and in the manner 
prescribed by the Secretary.
    (c) Independent audits. (1) If a lender originates or holds more 
than $5 million in FFEL loans during its fiscal year, it must submit an 
independent annual compliance audit for that year, conducted by a 
qualified independent organization or person. The Secretary may, 
following written notice, suspend the payment of interest benefits and 
special allowance to a lender that does not submit its audit within the 
time period prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) The audit required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must--
    (i) Examine the lender's compliance with the Act and applicable 
regulations;
    (ii) Examine the lender's financial management of its FFEL program 
activities;
    (iii) Be conducted in accordance with the standards for audits 
issued by the United States General Accounting Office's (GAO's) 
Government Auditing Standards. Procedures for audits are contained in an 
audit guide developed by and available from the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department;
    (iv) Be conducted at least annually and be submitted to the 
Secretary within six months of the end of the audit period. The initial 
audit must be of the lender's first fiscal year that begins after July 
23, 1992, and must be submitted within six months of the end of the 
audit period. Each subsequent audit must cover the lender's activities 
for the period beginning no later than the end of the period covered by 
the preceding audit;

[[Page 702]]

    (v) With regard to a lender that is a governmental entity, the audit 
required by this paragraph must be conducted in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 7502 and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G; and
    (vi) With regard to a lender that is a nonprofit organization, the 
audit required by this paragraph must be conducted in accordance with 
OMB Circular A-133, Audit of Institutions of Higher Education and Other 
Nonprofit Institutions, as incorporated in 34 CFR 74.61(h)(3). If a 
nonprofit lender meets the criteria in Circular A-133 for choosing the 
option for a program-specific audit, and so chooses, the program-
specific audit must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(c)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (vii) The Secretary may determine that a lender has met the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if the lender has been 
audited in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 for other purposes, the lender 
submits the results of the audit to the Office of Inspector General, and 
the Secretary determines that the audit meets the requirements of this 
paragraph.

following requirements at all times:
    (1) Aggregate loan limits. The aggregate guaranteed unpaid principal

[[Page 703]]

amount for all Stafford and SLS, loans made to a borrower may not exceed 
the amounts set forth in Sec. 682.204 (b), (e), and (g).
    (2) Annual loan limits. (i) The annual loan maximum amount for a 
borrower that may be guaranteed for an academic year may not exceed the 
amounts set forth in Sec. 682.204 (a), (c), (d), (f), and (h).

least six academic years of study.
    (4) Reinstatement of borrower eligibility. For a borrower's loans 
held by a guaranty agency on which a reinsurance claim has been paid by

upon the borrower's request, renewed eligibility for Title IV assistance 
once the borrower has made satisfactory repayment arrangements as that 
term is defined in Sec. 682.200.
    (i) For purposes of this section, the determination of reasonable 
and affordable must--
    (A) Include consideration of the borrower's and spouse's disposable 
income and necessary expenses including, but not limited to, housing, 
utilities, food, medical costs, dependent care costs, work-related 
expenses and other Title IV repayment;
    (B) Not be a required minimum payment amount, e.g. $50, if the 
agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable 
based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. The agency must 
include documentation in the borrower's file of the basis for the 
determination, if the monthly reasonable and affordable payment 
established under this section is less than $50.00 or the monthly 
accrued interest on the loan, whichever is greater.
    (C) Be based on the documentation provided by the borrower or other 
sources including, but not limited to--
    (1) Evidence of current income (e.g. proof of welfare benefits, 
Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, Workers' 
Compensation, child support, veterans' benefits, two most recent pay 
stubs, most recent copy of U.S. income tax return, State Department of 
Labor reports);
    (2) Evidence of current expenses (e.g. a copy of the borrower's

assistance, and provide the borrower with an opportunity to object to 
those terms.
    (iv) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with written 
information regarding the possibility of loan rehabilitation if the

only

[[Page 704]]

her preferred lender on the promissory note or other written or 
electronic documentation submitted during the loan origination process 
if he or she has such a preference.
    (ii) The borrower must give the lender, as part of the promissory 
note or application process for a PLUS loan--
    (A) A statement, as described in 34 CFR part 668, that the loan will 
be used for the cost of the student's attendance;
    (B) A statement from the student authorizing the school to release 
information relevant to the student's eligibility to have a parent 
borrow on the student's behalf (e.g., the student's enrollment status, 
financial assistance, and employment records); and
    (C) Information from the school providing the maximum amount that 
may be borrowed on behalf of the student.
    (iii) The borrower shall give the lender, as part of the application 
process for a Consolidation loan--
    (A) Information demonstrating that the borrower is eligible for the

address; and
    (B) The school of any change in local address during enrollment.
    (6) School eligibility. (i) General. A school that has a program 
participation agreement in effect with the Secretary under Sec. 682.600 
is eligible to participate in the program of the agency under reasonable 
criteria established by the guaranty agency, and approved by the 
Secretary, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, except to the extent 
that--
    (A) The school's eligibility is limited, suspended, or terminated by

standards and procedures that are substantially the same as those in 34 
CFR part 668;
    (B) The Secretary upholds the limitation, suspension, or termination

guaranty agency programs under section 432(h)(3) of the Act or 
Sec. 682.713;
    (C) The school is ineligible under section 435(a)(2) of the Act;
    (D) There is a State constitutional prohibition affecting the 
school's eligibility;
    (E) The school's programs consist of study solely by correspondence;
    (F) The agency determines, subject to the agreement of the 
Secretary, that the school does not satisfy the standards of 
administrative capability and financial responsibility as defined in 34

    (G) The school fails to make timely refunds to students as required 
in Sec. 682.607(c);
    (H) The school has not satisfied, within 30 days of issuance, a 
final judgment obtained by a student seeking a refund;
    (I) The school or an owner, director, or officer of the school is

proceeding regarding the obtaining, maintenance, or disbursement of 
State or Federal student grant, loan, or work assistance funds; or
    (J) The school or an owner, director, or officer of the school has 
unpaid financial liabilities involving the improper acquisition, 
expenditure, or refund of State or Federal student financial assistance 
funds.
    (ii) Limitation by a guaranty agency of a school's participation. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a school that is subject to limitation 
of participation in the guaranty agency's program may be either a school 
that is applying to participate in the agency's program for the first 
time, or a school that is renewing its application to continue 
participation in the agency's program. A guaranty agency may limit the 
total number of loans or the volume of loans made to students attending 
a particular school, or otherwise establish appropriate limitations on 
the school's participation, if the agency makes a

[[Page 705]]

determination that the school does not satisfy--
    (A) The standards of financial responsibility defined in 34 CFR 
668.5; or
    (B) The standards of administrative capability defined in 34 CFR 
668.16.
    (iii) Limitation, suspension, or termination of school eligibility. 
A guaranty agency may limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of 
an eligible school. If a guaranty agency limits, suspends, or terminates 
the participation of a school from the agency's program, the Secretary 
applies that limitation, suspension, or termination to all locations of 
the school.
    (iv) Condition for guaranteeing loans for students attending a 
school. The guaranty agency may require the school to execute a 
participation agreement with the agency and to submit documentation that 
establishes the school's eligibility to participate in the agency's 
program.
    (7) Lender eligibility. (i) An eligible lender may participate in 
the program of the agency under reasonable criteria established by the 
guaranty agency except to the extent that--
    (A) The lender's eligibility has been limited, suspended, or 
terminated by the Secretary under subpart G of this part or by the 
agency under standards and procedures that are substantially the same as 
those in subpart G of this part; or
    (B) The lender is disqualified by the Secretary under sections 
432(h)(1), 432(h)(2), 435(d)(3), or 435(d)(5) of the Act or 
Sec. 682.712; or
    (C) There is a State constitutional prohibition affecting the 
lender's eligibility.
    (ii) The agency may not guarantee a loan made by a school lender 
that is not located in the geographical area that the agency serves.
    (iii) The guaranty agency may refuse to guarantee loans made by a 
school on behalf of students not attending that school.
    (iv) The guaranty agency may, in determining whether to enter into a 
guarantee agreement with a lender, consider whether the lender has had 
prior experience in a similar Federal, State, or private nonprofit 
student loan program and the amount and percentage of loans that are 
currently delinquent or in default under that program.
    (8) Out-of-State schools. The agency shall guarantee Stafford, SLS, 
and PLUS loans for students who are legal residents of any State served 
by the agency under Sec. 682.404(h)(2) but who attend schools out of 
that State and for parents who are legal residents of that State and are 
borrowing on behalf of students attending schools out of that State. In 
guaranteeing these loans, the agency may not impose any restrictions 
that it does not apply to borrowers who are legal residents of the State 
attending in-State schools or to parent borrowers who are legal 
residents of the State and are borrowing for students attending in-State 
schools.
    (9) Out-of-State residents. The agency shall guarantee Stafford, 
SLS, and PLUS loans for students who are not legal residents of any 
State served by the agency under Sec. 682.404(h)(2) but who attend 
schools in that State, and for parents who are not legal residents of 
that State and who are borrowing on behalf of students attending schools 
in that State. In guaranteeing these loans, the agency may not impose 
any restrictions that it does not apply to borrowers who are legal 
residents of the State attending in-State schools, or to parent 
borrowers who are legal residents of the State and who are borrowing for 
students attending in-State schools.
    (10) Insurance premiums. (i) Except for a SLS or PLUS loan 
refinanced under Sec. 682.209 (e) or (f), the guaranty agency may charge 
the lender an insurance premium on each Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan it 
guarantees.
    (ii) The guaranty agency may use the proceeds of this charge only to 
guarantee loans and to cover costs incurred by the guaranty agency in 
the administration of its loan guarantee program.
    (iii) The lender may deduct the amount of the premium from the 
borrower's loan proceeds. For a loan disbursed in more than one 
installment, the insurance premium must be deducted proportionately from 
each disbursement of the loan proceeds.
    (iv) The amount of the insurance premium may not exceed--

[[Page 706]]

    (A) For a loan disbursed on or before June 30, 1994, 3 percent of 
the principal balance of the loan; or
    (B) For a loan disbursed on or after July 1, 1994, 1 percent of the 
principal balance of the loan.
    (v) The guaranty agency shall refund to the lender any insurance 
premium received for a loan under the circumstances specified in 
Sec. 682.401(b)(10)(vi) (A) and (B).
    (vi) The lender shall refund to the borrower by a credit against the 
borrower's loan balance the insurance premium paid by the borrower on a 
loan under the following circumstances:
    (A) The premium attributable to each disbursement of a loan must be 
refunded if the loan check is returned uncashed to the lender.
    (B) The premium or an appropriate prorated amount of the premium 
must be refunded by application to the borrower's loan balance if--
    (1) The loan or a portion of the loan is returned by the school to 
the lender in order to comply with the Act or with applicable 
regulations;
    (2) Within 120 days of disbursement, the loan or a portion of the 
loan is repaid or returned, unless--
    (i) The borrower has no FFEL Program loans in repayment status and 
has requested, in writing, that the repaid or returned funds be used for 
a different purpose; or
    (ii) The borrower has a FFEL Program loan in repayment status, in 
which case the payment is applied in accordance with Sec. 682.209(b) 
unless the borrower has requested, in writing, that the repaid or 
returned funds be applied as a cancellation of all or part of the loan;
    (3) Within 120 days of disbursement, the loan check has not been 
negotiated; or
    (4) Within 120 days of disbursement, the loan proceeds disbursed by

    (11) Inquiries. The agency must be able to receive and respond to 
written, electronic, and telephone inquiries.
    (12) Administrative fee for Consolidation loans. The guaranty agency 
may charge a lender a fee, not to exceed $50, reasonably calculated to 
cover the agency's cost of increased or extended liability incurred in 
guaranteeing a Consolidation loan. The lender may not pass the fee on to 
the borrower. If it charges the fee, the agency must charge it for all 
loans made under the agency's Consolidation Loan program.
    (13) Administrative fee for refinancing fixed-rate PLUS or SLS 
loans. The guaranty agency may require a lender to pay to the guaranty 
agency up to 50 percent of the fee the lender charges a borrower under 
Sec. 682.202(e) for the purpose of defraying the agency's administrative 
costs incident to the guarantee of a lender's reissuance of a fixed-rate 
PLUS or SLS loan at a variable interest rate. If it charges the fee, the 
agency must charge the same fee to all lenders that refinance under this 
paragraph.
    (14) Guaranty liability. The guaranty agency shall guarantee--
    (i) 100 percent of the unpaid principal balance of each loan 
guaranteed for loans disbursed before October 1, 1993; and
    (ii) Not more than 98 percent of the unpaid principal balance of 
each loan guaranteed for loans first disbursed on or after October 1, 
1993.
    (15) Guaranty agency verification of default data. A guaranty agency 
must meet the requirements and deadlines provided for it in subpart M of 
34 CFR part 668 for the cohort default rate process.
    (16) Guaranty agency administration. In the case of a State loan 
guarantee program administered by a State government, the program must 
be administered by a single State agency, or by one or more private 
nonprofit institutions or organizations under the supervision of a 
single State agency. For this purpose, ``supervision'' includes, but is 
not limited to, setting policies and procedures, and having full 
responsibility for the operation of the program.
    (17) Loan assignment. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(17)(iii) of this section, the guaranty agency must allow a loan to

    (C) An educational institution, whether or not it is an eligible 
lender, in connection with the institution's repayment to the agency or 
to the Secretary of a guarantee or a reinsurance claim payment made on a 
loan that was ineligible for the payment;

acting on behalf of such an agency and acting as a conservator, 
liquidator, or receiver of an eligible lender; or

of transfer of an interest in the loan, including a pledge of such an 
interest as security.
    (iii) The guaranty agency must allow a loan to be assigned under 
paragraph (b)(17)(i) of this section, following the first disbursement 
of the loan if the assignment does not result in a change in the 
identity of the party to whom payments must be made.
    (18) Transfer of guarantees. Except in the case of a transfer of 
guarantee requested by a borrower seeking a transfer to secure a single 
guarantor, the guaranty agency may transfer its guarantee obligation on 
a loan to another guaranty agency, only with the approval of the 
Secretary, the transferee agency, and the holder of the loan.
    (19) Standards and procedures. (i) The guaranty agency shall 
establish, disseminate to concerned parties, and enforce standards and 
procedures for--
    (A) Ensuring that all lenders in its program meet the definition of 
``eligible lender'' in section 435(d) of the Act and have a written 
lender agreement with the agency;
    (B) School and lender participation in its program;
    (C) Limitation, suspension, termination of school and lender

subparts B, C, D, and F of this part.
    (20) Monitoring student enrollment. The guaranty agency shall 
monitor the enrollment status of a FFEL program borrower or student on 
whose behalf a parent has borrowed that includes, at a minimum, 
reporting to the current holder of the loan within 60 days any change in 
the student's enrollment status reported that triggers--
    (i) The beginning of the borrower's grace period; or
    (ii) The beginning or resumption of the borrower's immediate 
obligation to make scheduled payments.
    (21) Submission of interest and special allowance information. Upon 
the Secretary's request, the guaranty agency shall submit, or require 
its lenders to submit, information that the Secretary deems necessary 
for determining the amount of interest benefits and special allowance 
payable on the agency's guaranteed loans.
    (22) Submission of information for reports. The guaranty agency

must be paid by the guaranty agency making the request.
    (24) Information on defaults. The guaranty agency shall, upon the 
request of a school, furnish information with respect to students, 
including the names and addresses of such students, who were enrolled at 
that school and who are in default on the repayment of any loan 
guaranteed by that agency.
    (25) Information on loan sales or transfers. The guaranty agency 
must, upon the request of a school, furnish to the school last attended 
by the student, information with respect to the sale or transfer of a 
borrower's loan prior to the beginning of the repayment period, 
including--
    (i) Notice of assignment;
    (ii) The identity of the assignee;
    (iii) The name and address of the party by which contact may be made 
with the holder concerning repayment of the loan; and
    (iv) The telephone number of the assignee or, if the assignee uses a 
lender servicer, another appropriate number for borrower inquiries.
    (26) Third-party servicers. The guaranty agency may not enter into a 
contract with a third-party servicer that the Secretary has determined 
does not meet the financial and compliance standards under Sec. 682.416. 
The guaranty agency shall provide the Secretary with the name and 
address of any third-party servicer with which the agency enters into a 
contract and, upon request by the Secretary, a copy of that contract.
    (27) Collection charges and late fees on defaulted FFEL loans being 
consolidated. (i) A guaranty agency may add collection costs in an 
amount not to exceed 18.5 percent of the outstanding principal and 
interest to a defaulted FFEL Program loan that is included in a Federal 
Consolidation loan.
    (ii) When returning the proceeds from the consolidation of a 
defaulted loan to the Secretary, a guaranty agency may only retain the 
amount added to the borrower's balance pursuant to paragraph (b)(27)(i) 
of this section.
    (28) Change in agency's records system. The agency shall provide 
written notification to the Secretary at least 30 days prior to placing 
its new guarantees or converting the records relating to its existing 
guaranty portfolio to an information or computer system that is owned 
by, or otherwise under the control of, an entity that is different than 
the party that owns or controls the agency's existing information or 
computer system. If the agency is soliciting bids from third parties 
with respect to a proposed conversion, the agency shall provide written 
notice to the Secretary as soon as the solicitation begins. The 
notification described in this paragraph must include a concise 
description of the agency's conversion project and the actual or 
estimated cost of the project.
    (c) Lender-of-last-resort. (1) The guaranty agency must ensure that 
it, or an eligible lender described in section 435(d)(1)(D) of the Act, 
serves as a lender-of-last-resort in the State in which the guaranty 
agency is the designated guaranty agency. The guaranty agency or an 
eligible lender described in section 435(d)(1)(D) of the Act may arrange 
for a loan required to be made under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to 
be made by another eligible lender. As used in this paragraph, the term 
``designated guaranty agency'' means the guaranty agency in the State 
for which the Secretary has signed a Basic Program Agreement under this 
section.
    (2) The lender-of-last-resort must make subsidized Federal Stafford 
loans and unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans to any eligible student 
who--
    (i) Qualifies for interest benefits pursuant to Sec. 682.301;
    (ii) Qualifies for a combined loan amount of at least $200; and
    (iii) Has been otherwise unable to obtain loans from another 
eligible lender for the same period of enrollment.
    (3) The lender-of-last resort may make unsubsidized Federal Stafford 
and Federal PLUS loans to borrowers who have been otherwise unable to 
obtain those loans from another eligible lender.
    (4) The guaranty agency must develop policies and operating 
procedures for its lender-of-last-resort program that provide for the 
accessibility of

[[Page 709]]

lender-of-last-resort loans. These policies and procedures must be 
submitted to the Secretary for approval as required under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section. The policies and procedures for the agency's 
lender-of-last-resort program must ensure that--
    (i) The guaranty agency will serve eligible students attending any 
eligible school;
    (ii) The program establishes operating hours and methods of 
application designed to facilitate application by students; and
    (iii) Information about the availability of loans under the program 
is made available to schools in the State;
    (iv) Appropriate steps are taken to ensure that borrowers receiving 
loans under the program are appropriately counseled on their loan 
obligation;
    (v) The guaranty agency will respond to a student within 60 days 
after the student submits an original complete application; and
    (vi) Borrowers are not required to obtain more than two objections 
from eligible lenders prior to requesting assistance under the lender-
of-last-resort program.
    (5)(i) Upon request of the guaranty agency, the Secretary may 
advance Federal funds to the agency, on terms and conditions agreed to 
by the Secretary and the agency, to ensure the availability of loan 
capital for subsidized and unsubsidized Federal Stafford and Federal 
PLUS loans to borrowers who are otherwise unable to obtain those loans 
if the Secretary determines that--
    (A) Eligible borrowers in a State who qualify for subsidized Federal 
Stafford loans are seeking and are unable to obtain subsidized Federal 
Stafford loans;
    (B) The guaranty agency designated for that State has the capability 
for providing lender-of-last-resort loans in a timely manner, either 
directly or indirectly using a third party, in accordance with the 
guaranty agency's obligations under the Act, but cannot do so without 
advances provided by the Secretary; and
    (C) It would be cost-effective to advance Federal funds to the 
agency.
    (ii) If the Secretary determines that the designated guaranty agency 
does not have the capability to provide lender-of-last-resort loans, in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the Secretary may 
provide Federal funds to another guaranty agency, under terms and 
conditions agreed to by the Secretary and the agency, to make lender-of-
last-resort loans in that State.
    (d) Review of forms and procedures. (1) The guaranty agency shall 
submit to the Secretary its write-off criteria and procedures. The 
agency may not use these materials until the Secretary approves them.
    (2) The guaranty agency shall promptly submit to the Secretary its 
regulations, statements of procedures and standards, agreements, and 
other materials that substantially affect the operation of the agency's 
program, and any proposed changes to those materials. Except as provided 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the agency may use these materials 
unless and until the Secretary disapproves them.
    (3) The guaranty agency must use common application forms, 
promissory notes, Master Promissory Notes (MPN), and other common forms 
approved by the Secretary.
    (4)(i) The Secretary authorizes the use of the multi-year feature of 
the MPN--
    (A) For students and parents for attendance at four-year or 
graduate/professional schools; and
    (B) For students and parents for attendance at other institutions 
meeting criteria or otherwise designated at the sole discretion of the 
Secretary.
    (ii) The Secretary may prohibit use of the multi-year feature of the 
MPN at specific schools described under paragraph (4)(i) of this section 
under circumstances including, but not limited to, the school being 
subject to an emergency action or a limitation, suspension, or 
termination action, or not meeting other performance criteria determined 
by the Secretary.
    (iii) A student or parent borrower who is borrowing funds for 
attendance at a school for which the multi-year feature of the MPN has 
not been authorized must complete a new promissory note for each 
academic year.
    (iv) Each loan made under an MPN is enforceable in accordance with 
the terms of the MPN and is eligible for

[[Page 710]]

claim payment based on a true and exact copy of such MPN.
    (v) A lender's ability to make additional loans under an MPN will 
automatically expire upon the earliest of--
    (A) The date the lender receives written notification from the 
borrower requesting that the MPN no longer be used as the basis for 
additional loans;
    (B) Twelve months after the date the borrower signed the MPN if no 
disbursements are issued by the lender under that MPN; or
    (C) Ten years from the date the borrower signed the MPN or the date 
the lender receives the MPN. However, if a portion of a loan is made on 
or before 10 years from the signature date, remaining disbursements of 
that loan may be made.
    (vi) The lender and school must develop and document a confirmation 
process in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary for 
loans made under the multi-year feature of the MPN.
    (5) The guaranty agency must develop and implement appropriate 
procedures that provide for the granting of a student deferment as 
specified in Sec. 682.210(a)(6)(iv) and (c)(3) and require their lenders 
to use these procedures.
    (6) The guaranty agency shall ensure that all program materials meet 
the requirements of Federal and State law, including, but not limited 
to, the Act and the regulations in this part and part 668.
    (e) Prohibited inducements. A guaranty agency may be--
    (1) Offer directly or indirectly any premium, payment, or other 
inducement to an employee or student of a school, or an entity or 
individual affiliated with a school, to secure applicants for FFEL 
loans, except that a guaranty agency is not prohibited from providing 
assistance to schools comparable to the kinds of assistance provided by 
the Secretary to schools under, or in furtherance of, the Federal Direct 
Loan Program;
    (2)(i) Offer, directly or indirectly, any premium, incentive 
payment, or other inducement to any lender, or any person acting as an 
agent, employee, or independent contractor of any lender or other 
guaranty agency to administer or market FFEL loans, other than 
unsubsidized Stafford loans or subsidized Stafford loans made under a 
guaranty agency's lender-of-last-resort program, in an effort to secure 
the guaranty agency as an insurer of FFEL loans. Examples of prohibited 
inducements include, but are not limited to--
    (A) Compensating lenders or their representatives for the purpose of 
securing loan applications for guarantee;
    (B) Performing functions normally performed by lenders without 
appropriate compensation;
    (C) Providing equipment or supplies to lenders at below market cost 
or rental; or
    (D) Offering to pay a lender, that does not hold loans guaranteed by 
the agency, a fee for each application forwarded for the agency's 
guarantee.
    (ii) For the purposes of this section, the terms ``premium'', 
``inducement'', and ``incentive'' do not include services directly 
related to the enhancement of the administration of the FFEL Program the 
guaranty agency generally provides to lenders that participate in its 
program. However, the terms ``premium'', ``inducement'', and 
``incentive'' do apply to other activities specifically intended to 
secure a lender's participation in the agency's program.
    (3) Mail or otherwise distribute unsolicited loan applications to 
students enrolled in a secondary school or a postsecondary institution, 
or to parents of those students, unless the potential borrower has 
previously received loans insured by the guaranty agency;
    (4) Conduct fraudulent or misleading advertising concerning loan 
availability.

<R05>
Sec. 682.402  Death, disability, closed school, false certification, unpaid refunds, and bankruptcy payments.

    (a) General. (1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on 
filing for relief in bankruptcy, and discharge of loans due to death, 
total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, 
false certification by a school of a borrower's eligibility for a loan, 
and unpaid refunds by a school are set forth in this section.
    (2) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, or a 
Consolidation loan was obtained by a married couple, and only one of the 
borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection 
of his or her loan obligation stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that 
obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains 
obligated to repay the loan unless that borrower would qualify for 
discharge of the loan under these regulations.
    (3) Except for a borrower's loan obligation discharged by the 
Secretary under the false certification discharge provision of 
paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a loan qualifies for payment 
under this section and as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this 
section, only to the extent that the loan is legally enforceable under 
applicable law by the holder of the loan.
    (4) For purposes of this section--
    (i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on 
the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative tribunal of competent 
jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to 
another loan in a judgment that collaterally estops the holder from 
contesting the enforceability of the loan;
    (ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable 
to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant to an objection 
presented in a proceeding conducted in connection with credit bureau 
reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment, or in any other 
administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and
    (iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another 
party about the legal enforceability of the loan and no determination 
has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the 
Secretary may authorize the payment of a claim under this section under 
conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary 
determines in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this 
section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable 
obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund 
that amount of the payment to the Secretary.
    (b) Death. (1) If an individual borrower dies, or the student for 
whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the borrower 
and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged.
    (2) A discharge of a loan based on the death of the borrower (or 
student in the case of a PLUS loan) must be based on an original or 
certified copy of the death certificate. Under exceptional circumstances 
and on a case-by-case basis, the chief executive officer of the guaranty 
agency may approve a discharge based upon other reliable documentation 
supporting the discharge request.
    (3) After receiving reliable information indicating that the 
borrower (or student) has died, the lender must suspend any collection 
activity against the borrower and any endorser for up to 60 days and 
promptly request the documentation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. If additional time is required to obtain the documentation, the 
period of suspension of collection activity may be extended up to an 
additional 60 days. If the lender is not able to obtain an original or 
certified copy of the death certificate or other documentation 
acceptable to the guaranty agency, under the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, during the period of suspension, the lender must 
resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued. 
The lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance as to repayment of 
the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended.
    (4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender may not 
attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any 
endorser.

[[Page 712]]

    (5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from 
the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after the date of the 
borrower's (or student's) death.
    (c) Total and permanent disability. (1)(i) If the Secretary has made 
an initial determination that the borrower is totally and permanently 
disabled, as defined in Sec. 682.200(b), the loan is conditionally 
discharged for up to three years from the date that the borrower became 
totally and permanently disabled, as certified by a physician. The 
Secretary suspends collection activity on the loan from the date of the 
initial determination of total and permanent disability until the end of 
the conditional period. If the borrower satisfies the criteria for a 
total and permanent disability discharge during and at the end of the 
conditional discharge period, the balance of the loan is discharged at 
the end of the conditional discharge period and any payments received 
after the date the borrower became totally and permanently disabled as 
certified under Sec. 682.402(c)(2), are returned to the sender.
    (ii) A borrower satisfies the criteria for a discharge of a loan 
based on a total and permanent disability if, during and at the end of 
the three-year period described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section--
    (A) The borrower's annual earnings from employment do not exceed 100 
percent of the poverty line for a family of two, as determined in 
accordance with the Community Service Block Grant Act; and
    (B) The borrower does not receive a new loan under the Perkins, 
FFEL, or Direct Loan programs, except for a FFEL or Direct Consolidation 
loan that does not include any loans that are in a conditional discharge 
status.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, 
a borrower is not considered totally and permanently disabled based on a 
condition that existed at the time the loan was made unless the 
borrower's condition substantially deteriorated.
    (iv)(A) For a Consolidation Loan, a borrower is considered totally 
and permanently disabled if he or she would be considered totally and 
permanently disabled under paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (iii) of this 
section for all of the loans that were included in the Consolidation 
Loan if those loans had not been consolidated.
    (B) For the purposes of discharging a loan under paragraph 
(c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, provisions in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) 
through (iii) of this section apply to each loan included in the 
Consolidation Loan, even if the loan is not a FFEL Program loan.
    (C) If requested, a borrower seeking to discharge a loan obligation 
under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section must provide the lender 
with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans if the lender does 
not possess that information.
    (2) After being notified by the borrower or the borrower's 
representative that the borrower claims to be totally and permanently 
disabled, the lender promptly requests that the borrower or the 
borrower's representative submit, on a form approved by the Secretary, a 
certification by a physician, who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy 
and legally authorized to practice in a State, that the borrower is 
totally and permanently disabled as defined in Sec. 682.200(b).
    (3) The lender must continue collection activities until it receives 
either the certification of total and permanent disability from a 
physician or a letter from a physician stating that the certification 
has been requested and that additional time is needed to determine if 
the borrower is totally and permanently disabled. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(7) of this section, after receiving the 
physician's certification or letter the lender may not attempt to 
collect from the borrower or any endorser.
    (4) The lender must submit a disability claim to the guaranty agency 
if the borrower submits a certification by a physician and the lender 
makes a determination that the certification supports the conclusion 
that the borrower meets the criteria for a total and permanent 
disability discharge, as defined in Sec. 682.200(b).
    (5) If the lender determines that a borrower who claims to be 
totally and permanently disabled is not totally and permanently 
disabled, or if the lender

[[Page 713]]

does not receive the physician's certification of total and permanent 
disability within 60 days of the receipt of the physician's letter 
requesting additional time, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, the lender must resume collection and is deemed to have 
exercised forbearance of payment of both principal and interest from the 
date collection activity was suspended. The lender may capitalize, in 
accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid 
during that period.
    (6) The guaranty agency must pay a claim submitted by the lender if 
the guaranty agency has reviewed the application and determined that it 
is complete and that it supports the conclusion that the borrower meets 
the criteria for a total and permanent disability discharge, as defined 
in Sec. 682.200(b).
    (7) If the guaranty agency does not pay the disability claim, the 
guaranty agency must return the claim to the lender with an explanation 
of the basis for the agency's denial of the claim. Upon receipt of the 
returned claim, the lender must notify the borrower that the application 
for a disability discharge has been denied, provide the basis for the 
denial, and inform the borrower that the lender will resume collection 
on the loan. The lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance of both 
principal and interest from the date collection activity was suspended 
until the first payment due date. The lender may capitalize, in 
accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid 
during that period.
    (8) If the guaranty agency pays the disability claim, the lender 
must notify the borrower that the loan will be assigned to the Secretary 
for determination of eligibility for a total and permanent disability 
discharge.
    (9) After receiving a claim payment from the guaranty agency, the 
lender must forward to the guaranty agency any payments subsequently 
received from or on behalf of the borrower.
    (10) The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency for a disability 
claim paid to the lender after the agency pays the claim to the lender.
    (11) The guaranty agency must assign the loan to the Secretary after 
the guaranty agency pays the disability claim.
    (12) If the Secretary determines that the certification and 
information provided by the borrower do not support the conclusion that 
the borrower meets the criteria for a total and permanent disability 
discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower that the application for 
a disability discharge has been denied, and that the loan is due and 
payable under the terms of the promissory note.
    (13) If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the 
borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the Secretary notifies the 
borrower that the loan is conditionally discharged and that the 
conditional discharge period will last for up to three years after the 
date the borrower became totally and permanently disabled as certified 
under Sec. 682.402(c)(2). The notification identifies the conditions of 
the conditional discharge period specified in paragraphs (c)(13) through 
(c)(16) of this section and specifies that all or part of the three-year 
period may predate the Secretary's initial determination.
    (14) During the conditional discharge period, the borrower--
    (i) Is not required to make any payments on the loan;
    (ii) Is not considered delinquent or in default on the loan, unless 
the borrower was delinquent or in default at the time the conditional 
discharge was granted;
    (iii) Must promptly notify the Secretary of any changes in address 
or phone number;
    (iv) Must promptly notify the Secretary if the borrower's annual 
earnings from employment exceed the amount specified in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; and
    (v) Must provide the Secretary, upon request, with additional 
documentation or information related to the borrower's eligibility for 
discharge under this section.
    (15) If, during and at the end of the conditional discharge period, 
the borrower continues to satisfy the eligibility criteria for a total 
and permanent disability discharge, as described in 
Sec. 682.402(c)(1)(ii), the balance of the loan is discharged.

[[Page 714]]

    (16) If, at any time during the three-year conditional discharge 
period, the borrower does not continue to meet the eligibility 
requirements for a total and permanent disability discharge, the 
Secretary resumes collection activity on the loan. The Secretary does 
not require the borrower to pay any interest that accrued on the loan 
from the date of the initial determination described in paragraph 
(c)(13) of this section through the end of the conditional discharge 
period.
    (d) Closed school--(1) General. (i) The Secretary reimburses the 
holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after January 1, 1986, and 
discharges the borrower's obligation with respect to the loan in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, if the 
borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan) could 
not complete the program of study for which the loan was intended 
because the school at which the borrower (or student) was enrolled, 
closed, or the borrower (or student) withdrew from the school not more 
than 90 days prior to the date the school closed. This 90-day period may 
be extended if the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances 
related to a school's closing would justify an extension.
    (ii) For purposes of the closed school discharge authorized by this 
section--
    (A) A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to 
provide educational instruction in all programs, as determined by the 
Secretary;
    (B) The term ``borrower'' includes all endorsers on a loan; and
    (C) A ``school'' means a school's main campus or any location or 
branch of the main campus, regardless of whether the school or its 
location or branch is considered eligible.
    (2) Relief available pursuant to discharge. (i) Discharge under 
paragraph (d) of this section relieves the borrower of an existing or 
past obligation to repay the loan and any charges imposed or costs 
incurred by the holder with respect to the loan that the borrower is, or 
was otherwise obligated to pay.
    (ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (d) of this section 
qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or 
through enforced collection on a loan obligation discharged under 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under 
paragraph (d) of this section is not regarded as in default on the loan 
after discharge, and is eligible to receive assistance under the Title 
IV, HEA programs.
    (iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (d) of this section must 
be reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting agencies to which 
the holder previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete 
all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.
    (3) Borrower qualification for discharge. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(8) of this section, in order to qualify for a discharge of 
a loan under paragraph (d) of this section, a borrower must submit a 
written request and sworn statement to the holder of the loan. The 
statement need not be notarized, but must be made by the borrower under 
the penalty of perjury, and, in the statement, the borrower must state--
    (i) Whether the student has made a claim with respect to the 
school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a 
performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and if so, the amount of 
any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the 
borrower's loan obligation;
    (ii) That the borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a 
PLUS loan)--
    (A) Received, on or after January 1, 1986, the proceeds of any 
disbursement of a loan disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after 
January 1, 1986 to attend a school;
    (B) Did not complete the educational program at that school because 
the school closed while the student was enrolled or on an approved leave 
of absence in accordance with Sec. 682.605(c), or the student withdrew 
from the school not more than 90 days before the school closed; and
    (C) Did not complete the program of study through a teach-out at 
another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at 
the closed school to another school;
    (iii) That the borrower agrees to provide, upon request by the 
Secretary or

[[Page 715]]

the Secretary's designee, other documentation reasonably available to 
the borrower that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary or 
the Secretary's designee, that the student meets the qualifications in 
paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (iv) That the borrower agrees to cooperate with the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section, and to transfer any right to recovery against a 
third party in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
    (4) Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions. (i) In any 
judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee to recover for amounts discharged under paragraph 
(d) of this section or to take other enforcement action with respect to 
the conduct on which those claims were based, a borrower who requests or 
receives a discharge under paragraph (d) of this section must cooperate 
with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. At the request of the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, and upon the Secretary's or the 
Secretary's designee's tendering to the borrower the fees and costs as 
are customarily provided in litigation to reimburse witnesses, the 
borrower shall--
    (A) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the 
borrower to support a request for discharge; and
    (B) Produce any documentation reasonably available to the borrower 
with respect to those representations and any sworn statement required 
by the Secretary with respect to those representations and documents.
    (ii) The Secretary revokes the discharge, or denies the request for 
discharge, of a borrower who--
    (A) Fails to provide testimony, sworn statements, or documentation 
to support material representations made by the borrower to obtain the 
discharge; or
    (B) Provides testimony, a sworn statement, or documentation that 
does not support the material representations made by the borrower to 
obtain the discharge.
    (5) Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery 
against third parties. (i) Upon discharge under paragraph (d) of this 
section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in 
favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount 
discharged) that the borrower (or student) may have by contract or 
applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for 
the program for which the loan was received, against the school, its 
principals, affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any 
private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents 
funds received from a private party.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply 
notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict 
transfer of such rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a 
transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a 
scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to 
recover on those rights.
    (iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or 
foreclosing the borrower's (or student's) right to pursue legal and 
equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise 
unrelated to the loan discharged.
    (6) Guaranty agency responsibilities--(i) Procedures applicable if a 
school closed on or after January 1, 1986, but prior to June 13, 1994. 
(A) If a borrower received a loan for attendance at a school with a 
closure date on or after January 1, 1986, but prior to June 13, 1994, 
the loan may be discharged in accordance with the procedures specified 
in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section.
    (B) If a loan subject to paragraph (d) of this section was 
discharged in part in accordance with the Secretary's ``Closed School 
Policy'' as authorized by section IV of Bulletin 89-G-159, the guaranty 
agency shall initiate the discharge of the remaining balance of the loan 
not later than August 13, 1994.
    (C) A guaranty agency shall review its records and identify all 
schools that appear to have closed on or after January 1, 1986 and prior 
to June 13, 1994, and shall identify the loans made to any borrower (or 
student) who appears to have been enrolled at the school on the school 
closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the closure 
date.

[[Page 716]]

    (D) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately if it 
determines that a school not previously known to have closed appears to 
have closed, and, within 30 days of making that determination, notify 
all lenders participating in its program to suspend collection efforts 
against individuals with respect to loans made for attendance at the 
closed school, if the student to whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was 
made, appears to have been enrolled at the school on the closing date, 
or withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the date the school appears 
to have closed. Within 30 days after receiving confirmation of the date 
of a school's closure from the Secretary, the agency shall--
    (1) Notify all lenders participating in its program to mail a 
discharge application explaining the procedures and eligibility criteria 
for obtaining a discharge and an explanation of the information that 
must be included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to all 
borrowers who may be eligible for a closed school discharge; and
    (2) Review the records of loans that it holds, identify the loans 
made to any borrower (or student) who appears to have been enrolled at 
the school on the school closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 
days prior to the closure date, and mail a discharge application and an 
explanation of the information that must be included in the sworn 
statement (which may be combined) to the borrower. The application shall 
inform the borrower of the procedures and eligibility criteria for 
obtaining a discharge.
    (E) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(D)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is known, the guaranty agency shall 
immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan 
received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may 
continue to receive borrower payments), and notify the borrower that the 
agency will provide additional information about the procedures for 
requesting a discharge after the agency has received confirmation from 
the Secretary that the school had closed.
    (F) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(D)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is unknown, the agency shall, by June 13, 
1995, further refine the list of borrowers whose loans are potentially 
subject to discharge under paragraph (d) of this section by consulting 
with representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing 
agency, accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. Upon learning 
the new address of a borrower who would still be considered potentially 
eligible for a discharge, the guaranty agency shall, within 30 days 
after learning the borrower's new address, mail to the borrower a 
discharge application that meets the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(6)(i)(E) of this section.
    (G) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this section has satisfied all of the 
conditions required for a discharge, the agency shall notify the 
borrower in writing of that determination within 30 days after making 
that determination.
    (H) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this section does not qualify for a 
discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in writing of that 
determination and the reasons for it within 30 days after the date the 
agency--
    (1) Made that determination based on information available to the 
guaranty agency;
    (2) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had not closed;
    (3) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had closed on a 
date that was more than 90 days after the borrower (or student) withdrew 
from the school;
    (4) Was notified by the Secretary that the borrower (or student) was 
ineligible for a closed school discharge for other reasons; or
    (5) Received the borrower's completed application and sworn 
statement.
    (I) If a borrower described in paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this 
section fails to submit the written request and sworn statement 
described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section within 60

[[Page 717]]

days of being notified of that option, the guaranty agency shall resume 
collection and shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment 
of principal and interest from the date it suspended collection 
activity. The agency may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), 
any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (J) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied solely on 
the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the lender, guaranty 
agency, or the Secretary.
    (ii) Procedures applicable if a school closed on or after June 13, 
1994. (A) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately 
whenever it becomes aware of reliable information indicating a school 
may have closed. The designated guaranty agency in the state in which 
the school is located shall promptly investigate whether the school has 
closed and, within 30 days after receiving information indicating that 
the school may have closed, report the results of its investigation to 
the Secretary concerning the date of the school's closure and whether a 
teach-out of the closed school's program was made available to students.
    (B) If a guaranty agency determines that a school appears to have 
closed, it shall, within 30 days of making that determination, notify 
all lenders participating in its program to suspend collection efforts 
against individuals with respect to loans made for attendance at the 
closed school, if the student to whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was 
made, appears to have been enrolled at the school on the closing date, 
or withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the date the school appears 
to have closed. Within 30 days after receiving confirmation of the date 
of a school's closure from the Secretary, the agency shall--
    (1) Notify all lenders participating in its program to mail a 
discharge application explaining the procedures and eligibility criteria 
for obtaining a discharge and an explanation of the information that 
must be included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to all 
borrowers who may be eligible for a closed school discharge; and
    (2) Review the records of loans that it holds, identify the loans 
made to any borrower (or student) who appears to have been enrolled at 
the school on the school closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 
days prior to the closure date, and mail a discharge application and an 
explanation of the information that must be included in the sworn 
statement (which may be combined) to the borrower. The application shall 
inform the borrower of the procedures and eligibility criteria for 
obtaining a discharge.
    (C) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is known, the guaranty agency shall 
immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan 
received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may 
continue to receive borrower payments), and notify the borrower that the 
agency will provide additional information about the procedures for 
requesting a discharge after the agency has received confirmation from 
the Secretary that the school had closed.
    (D) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is unknown, the agency shall, within one year 
after identifying the borrower, attempt to locate the borrower and 
further determine the borrower's potential eligibility for a discharge 
under paragraph (d) of this section by consulting with representatives 
of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, accrediting agency, 
and other appropriate parties. Upon learning the new address of a 
borrower who would still be considered potentially eligible for a 
discharge, the guaranty agency shall, within 30 days after learning the 
borrower's new address, mail to the borrower a discharge application 
that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (E) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) or (D) of this section has satisfied all of the 
conditions required for a discharge, the agency shall notify the 
borrower in writing of that determination within 30 days after making 
that determination.

[[Page 718]]

    (F) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) or (D) of this section does not qualify for a 
discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in writing of that 
determination and the reasons for it within 30 days after the date the 
agency--
    (1) Made that determination based on information available to the 
guaranty agency;
    (2) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had not closed;
    (3) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had closed on a 
date that was more than 90 days after the borrower (or student) withdrew 
from the school;
    (4) Was notified by the Secretary that the borrower (or student) was 
ineligible for a closed school discharge for other reasons; or
    (5) Received the borrower's completed application and sworn 
statement.
    (G) Upon receipt of a closed school discharge claim filed by a 
lender, the agency shall review the borrower's request and supporting 
sworn statement in light of information available from the records of 
the agency and from other sources, including other guaranty agencies, 
state authorities, and cognizant accrediting associations, and shall 
take the following actions--
    (1) If the agency determines that the borrower satisfies the 
requirements for discharge under paragraph (d) of this section, it shall 
pay the claim in accordance with Sec. 682.402(h) not later than 90 days 
after the agency received the claim; or
    (2) If the agency determines that the borrower does not qualify for 
a discharge, the agency shall, not later than 90 days after the agency 
received the claim, return the claim to the lender with an explanation 
of the reasons for its determination.
    (H) If a borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section within 60 days 
of being notified of that option, the lender or guaranty agency shall 
resume collection and shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of 
payment of principal and interest from the date it suspended collection 
activity. The lender or guaranty agency may capitalize, in accordance 
with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that 
period.
    (I) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied solely on 
the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the lender, guaranty 
agency, or the Secretary.
    (7) Lender responsibilities. (i) A lender shall comply with the 
requirements prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. In the absence 
of specific instructions from a guaranty agency or the Secretary, if a 
lender receives information from a source it believes to be reliable 
indicating that an existing or former borrower may be eligible for a 
loan discharge under paragraph (d) of this section, the lender shall 
immediately notify the guaranty agency, and suspend any efforts to 
collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study 
for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower 
payments).
    (ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section within 60 days 
after being notified of that option, the lender shall resume collection 
and shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of 
principal and interest from the date the lender suspended collection 
activity. The lender may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), 
any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (iii) The lender shall file a closed school claim with the guaranty 
agency in accordance with Sec. 682.402(g) no later than 60 days after 
the lender receives the borrower's written request and sworn statement 
described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If a lender receives a 
payment made by or on behalf of the borrower on the loan after the 
lender files a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender 
shall forward the payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its 
receipt. The lender shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in 
determining whether the borrower is eligible for discharge of the loan.
    (iv) Within 30 days after receiving reimbursement from the guaranty 
agency for a closed school claim, the lender shall notify the borrower 
that the loan

[[Page 719]]

obligation has been discharged, and request that all credit bureaus to 
which it previously reported the status of the loan delete all adverse 
credit history assigned to the loan.
    (v) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that 
the borrower's request for a closed school discharge has been denied, 
the lender shall resume collection and notify the borrower of the 
reasons for the denial. The lender shall be deemed to have exercised 
forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date the 
lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, in accordance 
with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that 
period.
    (8) Discharge without an application. A borrower's obligation to 
repay an FFEL Program loan may be discharged without an application from 
the borrower if the--
    (i) Borrower received a discharge on a loan pursuant to 34 CFR 
674.33(g) under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, or 34 CFR 685.213 
under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program; or
    (ii) The Secretary or the guaranty agency, with the Secretary's 
permission, determines that the borrower qualifies for a discharge based 
on information in the Secretary or guaranty agency's possession.
    (e) False certification by a school of a student's eligibility to 
borrow and unauthorized disbursements--(1) General. (i) The Secretary 
reimburses the holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after 
January 1, 1986, and discharges a current or former borrower's 
obligation with respect to the loan in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (e) of this section, if the borrower's (or the student for 
whom a parent received a PLUS loan) eligibility to receive the loan was 
falsely certified by an eligible school. For purposes of a false 
certification discharge, the term ``borrower'' includes all endorsers on 
a loan. A student's eligibility to borrow shall be considered to have 
been falsely certified by the school if the school--
    (A) Certified the student's eligibility for a FFEL Program loan on 
the basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did 
not meet the applicable requirements described in 34 CFR part 668 and 
section 484(d) of the Act, as applicable and as described in paragraph 
(e)(13) of this section; or
    (B) Signed the borrower's name without authorization by the borrower 
on the loan application or promissory note.
    (ii) The Secretary discharges the obligation of a borrower with 
respect to a loan disbursement for which the school, without the 
borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or 
authorization for electronic funds transfer, unless the student for whom 
the loan was made received the proceeds of the loan either by actual 
delivery of the loan funds or by a credit in the amount of the contested 
disbursement applied to charges owed to the school for that portion of 
the educational program completed by the student. However, the Secretary 
does not reimburse the lender with respect to any amount disbursed by 
means of a check bearing an unauthorized endorsement unless the school 
also executed the application or promissory note for that loan for the 
named borrower without that individual's consent.
    (2) Relief available pursuant to discharge. (i) Discharge under 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section relieves the borrower of an existing 
or past obligation to repay the loan certified by the school, and any 
charges imposed or costs incurred by the holder with respect to the loan 
that the borrower is, or was, otherwise obligated to pay.
    (ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section 
qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or 
through enforced collection on a loan obligation discharged under 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under 
paragraph (e) of this section is not regarded as in default on the loan 
after discharge, and is eligible to receive assistance under the Title 
IV, HEA programs.
    (iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section is 
reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting agencies to which 
the holder previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete 
all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.

[[Page 720]]

    (v) Discharge under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section qualifies 
the borrower for relief only with respect to the amount of the 
disbursement discharged.
    (3) Borrower qualification for discharge. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(14) of this section, to qualify for a discharge of a loan 
under paragraph (e) of this section, the borrower must submit to the 
holder of the loan a written request and a sworn statement. The 
statement need not be notarized, but must be made by the borrower under 
penalty of perjury, and, in the statement, the borrower must--
    (i) State whether the student has made a claim with respect to the 
school's false certification with any third party, such as the holder of 
a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and if so, the amount 
of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the 
borrower's loan obligation;
    (ii) In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge based on 
defective testing of the student's ability to benefit, state that the 
borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan)--
    (A) Received, on or after January 1, 1986, the proceeds of any 
disbursement of a loan disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after 
January 1, 1986 to attend a school; and
    (B) Was admitted to that school on the basis of ability to benefit 
from its training and did not meet the applicable requirements for 
admission on the basis of ability to benefit as described in paragraph 
(e)(13) of this section;
    (iii) In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the 
school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory 
note--
    (A) State that the signature on either of those documents was not 
the signature of the borrower; and
    (B) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two of 
which must be not earlier or later than one year before or after the 
date of the contested signature;
    (iv) In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the 
school, without authorization of the borrower, endorsed the borrower's 
name on the loan check or signed the authorization for electronic funds 
transfer or master check, the borrower shall--
    (A) Certify that he or she did not endorse the loan check or sign 
the authorization for electronic funds transfer or master check, or 
authorize the school to do so;
    (B) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two of 
which must be not earlier or later than one year before or after the 
date of the contested signature; and
    (C) State that the proceeds of the contested disbursement were not 
received either through actual delivery of the loan funds or by a credit 
in the amount of the contested disbursement applied to charges owed to 
the school for that portion of the educational program completed by the 
student;
    (v) That the borrower agrees to provide upon request by the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, other documentation reasonably 
available to the borrower, that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, that the student meets the 
qualifications in paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (vi) That the borrower agrees to cooperate with the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section, and to transfer any right to recovery against a 
third party in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
    (4) Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions. (i) In any 
judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee to recover for amounts discharged under paragraph 
(e) of this section or to take other enforcement action with respect to 
the conduct on which those claims were based, a borrower who requests or 
receives a discharge under paragraph (e) of this section must cooperate 
with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. At the request of the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, and upon the Secretary's or the 
Secretary's designee's tendering to the borrower the fees and costs as 
are customarily provided in litigation to reimburse witnesses, the 
borrower shall--
    (A) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the 
borrower to support a request for discharge; and

[[Page 721]]

    (B) Produce any documentation reasonably available to the borrower 
with respect to those representations and any sworn statement required 
by the Secretary with respect to those representations and documents.
    (ii) The Secretary revokes the discharge, or denies the request for 
discharge, of a borrower who--
    (A) Fails to provide testimony, sworn statements, or documentation 
to support material representations made by the borrower to obtain the 
discharge; or
    (B) Provides testimony, a sworn statement, or documentation that 
does not support the material representations made by the borrower to 
obtain the discharge.
    (5) Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery 
against third parties. (i) Upon discharge under paragraph (e) of this 
section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in 
favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount 
discharged) that the borrower (or student) may have by contract or 
applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for 
the program for which the loan was received, against the school, its 
principals, affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any 
private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents 
funds received from a private party.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraph (e) of this section apply 
notwithstanding any provision of state law that would otherwise restrict 
transfer of such rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a 
transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a 
scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to 
recover on those rights.
    (iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or 
foreclosing the borrower's (or student's) right to pursue legal and 
equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise 
unrelated to the loan discharged.
    (6) Guaranty agency responsibilities--general. (i) A guaranty agency 
shall notify the Secretary immediately whenever it becomes aware of 
reliable information indicating that a school may have falsely certified 
a student's eligibility or caused an unauthorized disbursement of loan 
proceeds, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The 
designated guaranty agency in the state in which the school is located 
shall promptly investigate whether the school has falsely certified a 
student's eligibility and, within 30 days after receiving information 
indicating that the school may have done so, report the results of its 
preliminary investigation to the Secretary.
    (ii) If the guaranty agency receives information it believes to be 
reliable indicating that a borrower whose loan is held by the agency may 
be eligible for a discharge under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
agency shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the 
borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the 
loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments), and 
inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.
    (iii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section within 60 days 
of being notified of that option, the guaranty agency shall resume 
collection and shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment 
of principal and interest from the date it suspended collection 
activity. The agency may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), 
any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (iv) Upon receipt of a discharge claim filed by a lender or a 
request submitted by a borrower with respect to a loan held by the 
guaranty agency, the agency shall have up to 90 days to determine 
whether the discharge should be granted. The agency shall review the 
borrower's request and supporting sworn statement in light of 
information available from the records of the agency and from other 
sources, including other guaranty agencies, state authorities, and 
cognizant accrediting associations.
    (v) A borrower's request for discharge and sworn statement may not 
be denied solely on the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by 
the lender, the Secretary or the guaranty agency.

not discharged and that, depending on the borrower's decision under 
paragraph (e)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, the loan shall either be 
returned to the lender or paid as a default claim; and
    (B) Notify the borrower that the borrower does not qualify for 
discharge, and state the reasons for that conclusion. The agency shall 
advise the borrower that he or she remains obligated to repay the loan 
and warn the borrower of the consequences of default, and explain that 
the borrower will be considered to be in default on the loan unless the 
borrower submits a written statement to the agency within 30 days

    (2) Requests the Secretary to review the agency's decision.
    (iv) Within 30 days after receiving the borrower's written statement

(e)(9)(ii), (e)(10)(ii), or (e)(10)(iii) of this section, as applicable.
    (12) Lender Responsibilities. (i) If the lender is notified by a 
guaranty agency or the Secretary, or receives information it believes to

[[Page 726]]

section, the lender shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect 
from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for 
which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments) 
and, within 30 days of receiving the information or notification, inform 
the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.
    (ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section within 60 days 
of being notified of that option, the lender shall resume collection and 
shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal 
and interest from the date the lender suspended collection activity. The 
lender may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest 
accrued and not paid during that period.
    (iii) The lender shall file a claim with the guaranty agency in 
accordance with Sec. 682.402(g) no later than 60 days after the lender 
receives the borrower's written request and sworn statement described in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If a lender receives a payment made by 
or on behalf of the borrower on the loan after the lender files a claim 
on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the 
payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The lender 
shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining whether 
the borrower is eligible for discharge of the loan.
    (iv) The lender shall comply with all instructions received from the 
Secretary or a guaranty agency with respect to loan discharges under 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (v) The lender shall review a claim that the borrower did not 
endorse and did not receive the proceeds of a loan check. The lender 
shall take the actions required under paragraphs (e)(8)(ii)(A) and (B) 
of this section if it determines that the borrower did not endorse the 
loan check, unless the lender secures persuasive evidence that the 
proceeds of the loan were received by the borrower or the student for 
whom the loan was made, as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). If the 
lender determines that the loan check was properly endorsed or the 
proceeds were received by the borrower or student, the lender may 
consider the borrower's objection to repayment as a statement of 
intention not to repay the loan, and may file a claim with the guaranty 
agency for reimbursement on that ground, but shall not report the loan 
to credit bureaus as in default until the guaranty agency, or, as 
applicable, the Secretary, reviews the claim for relief. By filing such 
a claim, the lender shall be deemed to have agreed to the following--
    (A) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower 
endorsed the loan check or the proceeds of the loan were received by the 
borrower or the student, any failure to satisfy due diligence 
requirements by the lender prior to the filing of the claim that would 
have resulted in the loss of reinsurance on the loan in the event of 
default will be waived by the Secretary; and
    (B) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower 
did not endorse the loan check and that the proceeds of the loan were 
not received by the borrower or the student, the lender will comply with 
the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(8)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (vi) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that 
the borrower's request for a discharge has been denied, the lender shall 
notify the borrower of the reasons for the denial and, if payments are 
due, resume collection against the borrower. The lender shall be deemed 
to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from 
the date the lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, 
in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid 
during that period.
    (13) Requirements for certifying a borrower's eligibility for a 
loan. (i) For periods of enrollment beginning between July 1, 1987 and 
June 30, 1991, a student who had a general education diploma or received 
one before the scheduled completion of the program of instruction is 
deemed to have the ability to benefit from the training offered by the 
school.

[[Page 727]]

    (ii) A student not described in paragraph (e)(13)(i) of this section

the Secretary on an independently administered test in accordance with 
subpart J of 34 CFR part 668; or
    (2) Enrolled in an eligible institution that participates in a State

offered by the school if--
    (A) The school certified the eligibility of the student for a FFEL 
Program loan; and
    (B) At the time of certification, the student would not meet the 
requirements for employment (in the student's State of residence) in the

    (iv) Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(13)(i) and (ii) of this section, 
a student has the ability to benefit from the training offered by the 
school if the student received a high school diploma or its recognized 
equivalent prior to enrollment at the school.
    (14) Discharge without an application. A borrower's obligation to 
repay all or a portion of an FFEL Program loan may be discharged without 
an application from the borrower if the Secretary, or the guaranty 
agency with the Secretary's permission, determines that the borrower 
qualifies for a discharge based on information in the Secretary or 
guaranty agency's possession.
    (f) Bankruptcy--(1) General. If a borrower files a petition for 
relief under the Bankruptcy Code, the Secretary reimburses the holder of 
the loan for unpaid principal and interest on the loan in accordance 
with paragraphs (h) through (k) of this section.

the Bankruptcy Code.
    (ii) If the lender is notified that a co-maker or endorser has filed 
a petition for relief in bankruptcy, the lender must immediately suspend 
any collection efforts outside the bankruptcy proceeding against the co-
maker or endorser and--
    (A) Must suspend collection efforts against the borrower and any 
other parties to the note if the co-maker or endorser has filed for 
relief under Chapters 12 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code; or

[[Page 728]]

    (B) May suspend any collection efforts against the borrower and any 
other parties to the note if the co-maker or endorser has filed for 
relief under Chapters 7 or 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
    (3) Determination of filing. The lender must determine that a 
borrower has filed a petition for relief in bankruptcy on the basis of 
receiving a notice of the first meeting of creditors or other proof of 
filing provided by the debtor's attorney or the bankruptcy court.
    (4) Proof of claim. Unless instructed otherwise by the guaranty 
agency, the lender shall file a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court 
within--
    (i) 30 days after the lender receives a notice of first meeting of 
creditors unless, in the case of a proceeding under chapter 7, the 
notice states that the borrower has no assets; or
    (ii) 30 days after the lender receives a notice from the court 
stating that a chapter 7 no-asset case has been converted to an asset 
case.
    (5) Filing of bankruptcy claim with the guaranty agency. (i) The 
lender shall file a bankruptcy claim on the loan with the guaranty 
agency in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, if--
    (A) The borrower has filed a petition for relief under chapters 12 
or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code; or
    (B) The borrower has filed a petition for relief under chapters 7 or 
11 of the Bankruptcy Code before October 8, 1998 and the loan has been 
in repayment for more than seven years (exclusive of any applicable 
suspension of the repayment period) from the due date of the first 
payment until the date of the filing of the petition for relief; or
    (C) The borrower has begun an action to have the loan obligation 
determined to be dischargeable on grounds of undue hardship.
    (ii) In cases not described in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, 
the lender shall continue to hold the loan notwithstanding the 
bankruptcy proceeding. Once the bankruptcy proceeding is completed or 
dismissed, the lender shall treat the loan as if the lender had 
exercised forbearance as to repayment of principal and interest accrued 
from the date of the borrower's filing of the bankruptcy petition until 
the date the lender is notified that the bankruptcy proceeding is 
completed or dismissed.
    (g) Claim procedures for a loan held by a lender--(1) Documentation. 
A lender shall provide the guaranty agency with the following

certified by the lender as true and exact.
    (ii) The loan application, if a separate loan application was

pertinent documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court by the 
lender, and an assignment to the guaranty agency of any proof of claim 
filed by the lender regarding the loan; and
    (B) A statement of any facts of which the lender is aware that may 
form the basis for an objection or exception to the discharge of the 
borrower's loan obligation in bankruptcy and all documents supporting 
those facts.
    (vi) In the case of a closed school claim, the documentation 
described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or any other 
documentation as the Secretary may require;
    (vii) In the case of a false certification claim, the documentation 
described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (2) Filing deadlines. A lender shall file a death, disability, 
closed school, false certification, or bankruptcy claim within the 
following periods:
    (i) Within 60 days of the date on which the lender determines that a 
borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent obtained a PLUS loan)

[[Page 729]]

the borrower is totally and permanently disabled.
    (ii) In the case of a closed school claim, the lender shall file a 
claim with the guaranty agency no later than 60 days after the borrower 
submits to the lender the written request and sworn statement described 
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section or after the lender is notified by 
the Secretary or the Secretary's designee or by the guaranty agency to 
do so.
    (iii) In the case of a false certification claim, the lender shall 
file a claim with the guaranty agency no later than 60 days after the

notified by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee or by the guaranty 
agency to do so.
    (iv) A lender shall file a bankruptcy claim with the guaranty agency 
by the earlier of--
    (A) 30 days after the date on which the lender receives notice of 
the first meeting of creditors or other information described in 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section; or
    (B) 15 days after the lender is served with a complaint or motion to 
have the loan determined to be dischargeable on grounds of undue 
hardship, or, if the lender secures an extension of time within which an 
answer may be filed, 25 days before the expiration of that extended 
period, whichever is later.
    (h) Payment of death, disability, closed school, false 
certification, and bankruptcy claims by the guaranty agency--(1) 
General. (i) The guaranty agency shall review a death, disability, or 
bankruptcy claim promptly and shall pay the lender on an approved claim 
the amount of loss in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, not 
later than 45 days after the claim was filed by the lender.
    (ii) In the case of a bankruptcy claim, the guaranty agency shall, 
upon receipt of the claim from the lender, immediately take those 
actions required under paragraph (i) of this section to oppose the 
discharge of the loan by the bankruptcy court.
    (iii) In the case of a closed school claim or a false certification 
claim based on the determination that the borrower did not sign the loan 
application, the promissory note, or the authorization for the 
electronic transfer of loan funds, or that the school failed to test, or 
improperly tested, the student's ability to benefit, the guaranty agency 
shall document its determination that the borrower is eligible for 
discharge under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section and pay the 
borrower or the holder the amount determined under paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section.
    (iv) In reviewing a claim under this section, the issue of 
confirmation of subsequent loans under an MPN will not be reviewed and a 
claim will not be denied based on the absence of any evidence relating 
to confirmation in a particular loan file. However, if a court rules 
that a loan is unenforceable solely because of the lack of evidence of 
the confirmation process or processes, insurance benefits must be 
repaid.
    (2)(i) The amount of loss payable--
    (A) On a death or disability claim is equal to the sum of the 
remaining principal balance and interest accrued on the loan, collection 
costs incurred by the lender and applied to the borrower's account 
within 30 days of the date those costs were actually incurred, and 
unpaid interest up to the date the lender should have filed the claim.
    (B) On a bankruptcy claim is equal to the unpaid balance of 
principal and interest determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of 
this section.
    (ii) The amount of loss payable to a lender on a closed school claim 
or on a false certification claim is equal to the sum of the remaining 
principal balance and interest accrued on the loan, collection costs 
incurred by the lender and applied to the borrower's account within 30 
days of the date those costs were actually incurred, and unpaid interest 
determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (iii) In the case of a closed school or false certification claim 
filed by a lender on an outstanding loan owed by the borrower, on the 
same date that the agency pays a claim to the lender, the agency shall 
pay the borrower an amount equal to the amount paid on the loan by or on 
behalf of the borrower, less any school tuition refunds or payments 
received by the holder or the borrower from a tuition recovery

[[Page 730]]

fund, performance bond, or other third-party source.
    (iv) In the case of a claim filed by a lender based on a request 
received from a borrower whose loan had been repaid in full by, or on 
behalf of the borrower to the lender, on the same date that the agency 
notifies the lender that the borrower is eligible for a closed school or 
false certification discharge, the agency shall pay the borrower an 
amount equal to the amount paid on the loan by or on behalf of the 
borrower, less any school tuition refunds or payments received by the 
holder or the borrower from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, 
or other third-party source.
    (v) In the case of a loan that has been included in a Consolidation 
Loan, the agency shall pay to the holder of the borrower's Consolidation 
Loan, an amount equal to--
    (A) The amount paid on the loan by or on behalf of the borrower at 
the time the loan was paid through consolidation;
    (B) The amount paid by the consolidating lender to the holder of the 
loan when it was repaid through consolidation; minus
    (C) Any school tuition refunds or payments received by the holder or 
the borrower from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other 
third-party source if those refunds or payments were--
    (1) Received by the borrower or received by the holder and applied 
to the borrower's loan balance before the date the loan was repaid 
through consolidation; or
    (2) Received by the borrower or received by the Consolidation Loan 
holder on or after the date the consolidating lender made a payment to 
the former holder to discharge the borrower's obligation to that former 
holder.
    (3) Payment of interest. If the guarantee covers unpaid interest, 
the amount payable on an approved claim includes the unpaid interest 
that accrues during the following periods:
    (i) During the period before the claim is filed, not to exceed the 
period provided for in paragraph (g)(2) of this section for filing the 
claim.
    (ii) During a period not to exceed 30 days following the receipt 
date by the lender of a claim returned by the guaranty agency for 
additional documentation necessary for the claim to be approved by the 
guaranty agency.
    (iii) During the period required by the guaranty agency to approve 
the claim and to authorize payment or to return the claim to the lender 
for additional documentation not to exceed--
    (A) 45 days for death, disability or bankruptcy claims; or
    (B) 90 days for closed school and false certifications.
    (i) Guaranty agency participation in bankruptcy proceedings--(1) 
Undue hardship claims. (i) In response to a petition filed prior to 
October 8, 1998 with regard to any bankruptcy proceeding by the borrower 
for discharge under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) on the grounds of undue 
hardship, the guaranty agency must, on the basis of reasonably available 
information, determine whether the first payment on the loan was due 
more than 7 years (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the 
repayment period) before the filing of that petition and, if so, process 
the claim.
    (ii) In all other cases, the guaranty agency must determine whether 
repayment under either the current repayment schedule or any adjusted 
schedule authorized under this part would impose an undue hardship on 
the borrower and his or her dependents.
    (iii) If the guaranty agency determines that repayment would not 
constitute an undue hardship, the guaranty agency must then determine 
whether the expected costs of opposing the discharge petition would 
exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, including 
principal, interest, late charges, and collection costs. If the guaranty 
agency has determined that the expected costs of opposing the discharge 
petition will exceed one-third of the total amount of the loan, it may, 
but is not required to, engage in the activities described in paragraph 
(i)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) The guaranty agency must use diligence and may assert any 
defense consistent with its status under applicable law to avoid 
discharge of the loan. Unless discharge would be more

[[Page 731]]

effectively opposed by not taking the following actions, the agency 
must--
    (A) Oppose the borrower's petition for a determination of 
dischargeability; and
    (B) If the borrower is in default on the loan, seek a judgment for 
the amount owed on the loan.
    (v) In opposing a petition for a determination of dischargeability 
on the grounds of undue hardship, a guaranty agency may agree to 
discharge of a portion of the amount owed on a loan if it reasonably 
determines that the agreement is necessary in order to obtain a judgment 
on the remainder of the loan.
    (2) Response by a guaranty agency to plans proposed under Chapters 
11, 12, and 13. The guaranty agency shall take the following actions 
when a petition for relief in bankruptcy under Chapters 11, 12, or 13 is 
filed:
    (i) The agency is not required to respond to a proposed plan that--
    (A) Provides for repayment of the full outstanding balance of the 
loan;
    (B) Makes no provision with regard to the loan or to general 
unsecured claims.
    (ii) In any other case, the agency shall determine, based on a 
review of its own records and documents filed by the debtor in the 
bankruptcy proceeding--
    (A) What part of the loan obligation will be discharged under the 
plan as proposed;
    (B) Whether the plan itself or the classification of the loan under 
the plan meets the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1129, 1225, or 1325, as 
applicable; and
    (C) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1112, 1208, or 1307, as 
applicable, to move for conversion or dismissal of the case.
    (iii) If the agency determines that grounds exist to challenge the 
proposed plan, the agency shall, as appropriate, object to the plan or 
move to dismiss the case, if--
    (A) The costs of litigation of these actions are not reasonably 
expected to exceed one-third of the amount of the loan to be discharged 
under the plan; and
    (B) With respect to an objection under 11 U.S.C. 1325, the 
additional amount that may be recovered under the plan if an objection 
is successful can reasonably be expected to equal or exceed the cost of 
litigating the objection.
    (iv) The agency shall monitor the debtor's performance under a 
confirmed plan. If the debtor fails to make payments required under the 
plan or seeks but does not demonstrate entitlement to discharge under 11 
U.S.C. 1328(b), the agency shall oppose any requested discharge or move 
to dismiss the case if the costs of litigation together with the costs 
incurred for objections to the plan are not reasonably expected to 
exceed one-third of the amount of the loan to be discharged under the 
plan.
    (j) Mandatory purchase by a lender of a loan subject to a bankruptcy 
claim. (1) The lender shall repurchase from the guaranty agency a loan 
held by the agency pursuant to a bankruptcy claim paid to that lender, 
unless the guaranty agency sells the loan to another lender, promptly 
after the earliest of the following events:
    (i) The entry of an order denying or revoking discharge or 
dismissing a proceeding under any chapter.
    (ii) A ruling in a proceeding under chapter 7 or 11 that the loan is 
not dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) or other applicable law.
    (iii) The entry of an order granting discharge under chapter 12 or 
13, or confirming a plan of arrangement under chapter 11, unless the 
court determined that the loan is dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. 
523(a)(8) on grounds of undue hardship.
    (2) The lender may capitalize all outstanding interest accrued on a 
loan purchased under paragraph (j) of this section to cover any periods 
of delinquency prior to the bankruptcy action through the date the 
lender purchases the loan and receives the supporting loan documentation 
from the guaranty agency.
    (k) Claims for reimbursement from the Secretary on loans held by 
guarantee agencies. (1)(i) The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency 
for its losses on bankruptcy claims paid to lenders after--
    (A) A determination by the court that the loan is dischargeable 
under 11

[[Page 732]]

U.S.C. 523(a)(8) with respect to a proceeding initiated under chapter 7 
or chapter 11; or
    (B) With respect to any other loan, after the agency pays the claim 
to the lender.
    (ii) The guaranty agency shall refund to the Secretary the full 
amount of reimbursement received from the Secretary on a loan that a 
lender repurchases under this section.
    (2) The Secretary pays a death, disability, bankruptcy, closed 
school, or false certification claim in an amount determined under 
Sec. 682.402(k)(5) on a loan held by a guaranty agency after the agency 
has paid a default claim to the lender thereon and received payment 
under its reinsurance agreement. The Secretary reimburses the guaranty 
agency only if--
    (i) The guaranty agency determines that the borrower (or the student 
for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan or each of the co-makers of a 
PLUS loan) has died, or the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a PLUS 
loan) has become totally and permanently disabled since applying for the 
loan, or has filed for relief in bankruptcy, in accordance with the 
procedures in paragraphs (b), (c), or (f) of this section, or the 
student was unable to complete an educational program because the school 
closed, or the borrower's eligibility to borrow (or the student's 
eligibility in the case of a PLUS loan) was falsely certified by an 
eligible school. For purposes of this paragraph, references to the 
``lender'' and ``guaranty agency'' in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section mean the guaranty agency and the Secretary respectively;
    (ii) In the case of a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan, the guaranty 
agency determines that the borrower (or the student for whom a parent 
obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has died, 
or the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has become 
totally and permanently disabled since applying for the loan, or has 
filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy within 10 years of the date 
the borrower entered repayment, exclusive of periods of deferment or 
periods of forbearance granted by the lender that extended the 10-year 
maximum repayment period, or the borrower (or the student for whom a 
parent received a PLUS loan) was unable to complete an educational 
program because the school closed, or the borrower's eligibility to 
borrow (or the student's eligibility in the case of a PLUS loan) was 
falsely certified by an eligible school;
    (iii) In the case of a Consolidation loan, the guaranty agency 
determines that the borrower (or each of the co-makers) has died, is 
determined to be totally and permanently disabled under Sec. 682.402(c), 
or has filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy within the maximum 
repayment period described in Sec. 682.209(h)(2), exclusive of periods 
of deferment or periods of forbearance granted by the lender that 
extended the maximum repayment period;
    (iv) The guaranty agency has not written off the loan in accordance 
with the procedures established by the agency under 
Sec. 682.410(b)(6)(x), except for closed school and false certification 
discharges; and
    (v) The guaranty agency has exercised due diligence in the 
collection of the loan in accordance with the procedures established by 
the agency under Sec. 682.410(b)(6)(x), until the borrower (or the 
student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the co-makers 
of a PLUS loan) has died, or the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a 
PLUS loan) has become totally and permanently disabled or filed a 
Chapter 12 or Chapter 13 petition, or had the loan discharged in 
bankruptcy, or for closed school and false certification claims, the 
guaranty agency receives a request for discharge from the borrower or 
another party.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) Within 30 days of receiving reimbursement for a closed school or 
false certification claim, the guaranty agency shall pay--
    (i) The borrower an amount equal to the amount paid on the loan by 
or on behalf of the borrower, less any school tuition refunds or 
payments received by the holder, guaranty agency, or the borrower from a 
tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third-party source; or
    (ii) The amount determined under paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this 
section to

[[Page 733]]

the holder of the borrower's Consolidation Loan.
    (5) The Secretary pays the guaranty agency a percentage of the 
outstanding principal and interest that is equal to the complement of 
the reinsurance percentage paid on the loan. This interest includes 
interest that accrues during--
    (i) For death or bankruptcy claims, the shorter of 60 days or the 
period from the date the guaranty agency determines that the borrower 
(or the student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the 
co-makers of a PLUS loan) dies, or filed a petition for relief in 
bankruptcy until the Secretary authorizes payment;
    (ii) For disability claims, the shorter of 60 days or the period 
from the date the guaranty agency makes a preliminary determination that 
the borrower became totally and permanently disabled until the Secretary 
authorizes payment; or
    (iii) For closed school or false certification claims, the period 
from the date on which the guaranty agency received payment from the 
Secretary on a default claim to the date on which the Secretary 
authorizes payment of the closed school or false certification claim.
    (l) Unpaid refund discharge. (1) Unpaid refunds in closed school 
situations. In the case of a school that has closed, the Secretary 
reimburses the guarantor of a loan and discharges a former or current 
borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of an 
FFEL Program loan (disbursed, in whole or in part on or after January 1, 
1986) equal to the refund that should have been made by the school under 
applicable Federal law and regulations, including this section. Any 
accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, 
origination fees, and insurance premiums) associated with the unpaid 
refund are also discharged.
    (2) Unpaid refunds in open school situations. In the case of a 
school that is open, the guarantor discharges a former or current 
borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of an 
FFEL loan (disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986) 
equal to the amount of the refund that should have been made by the 
school under applicable Federal law and regulations, including this 
section, if--
    (i) The borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) 
is not attending the school that owes the refund; and
    (ii) The guarantor receives documentation regarding the refund and 
the borrower and guarantor have been unable to resolve the unpaid refund 
within 120 days from the date the guarantor receivesa complete 
application in accordance with paragraph (l)(4) of this section. Any 
accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, 
origination fees, and insurance premiums) associated with the amount of 
the unpaid refund amount are also discharged.
    (3) Relief to borrower (and any endorser) following discharge. (i) 
If a borrower receives a discharge of a portion of a loan under this 
section, the borrower is reimbursed for any amounts paid in excess of 
the remaining balance of the loan (including accrued interest, late 
charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums) 
owed by the borrower at the time of discharge.
    (ii) The holder of the loan reports the discharge of a portion of a 
loan under this section to all credit reporting agencies to which the 
holder of the loan previously reported the status of the loan.
    (4) Borrower qualification for discharge. To receive a discharge of 
a portion of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit a written 
application to the holder or guaranty agency except as provided in 
paragraph (l)(5)(iv) of this section. The application requests the 
information required to calculate the amount of the discharge and 
requires the borrower to sign a statement swearing to the accuracy of 
the information in the application. The statement need not be notarized 
but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the 
statement, the borrower must--
    (i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent 
borrowed)--
    (A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or 
after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;

[[Page 734]]

    (B) Did not attend, withdrew, or was terminated from the school 
within a timeframe that entitled the borrower to a refund; and
    (C) Did not receive the benefit of a refund to which the borrower 
was entitled either from the school or from a third party, such as a 
holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program.
    (ii) State whether the borrower has any other application for 
discharge pending for this loan; and
    (iii) State that the borrower--
    (A) Agrees to provide upon request by the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee other documentation reasonably available to the 
borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications 
for an unpaid refund discharge under this section; and
    (B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary or the Secretary's 
designee in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to 
the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (5) Unpaid refund discharge procedures. (i) Except for the 
requirements of paragraph (l)(5)(iv) of this section related to an open 
school, if the holder or guaranty agency learns that a school did not 
pay a refund of loan proceeds owed under applicable law and regulations, 
the holder or the guaranty agency sends the borrower a discharge 
application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for 
obtaining a discharge. The holder of the loan also promptly suspends any 
efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan.
    (ii) If the borrower returns the application, specified in paragraph 
(l)(4) of this section, the holder or the guaranty agency must review 
the application to determine whether the application appears to be 
complete. In the case of a loan held by a lender, once the lender 
determines that the application appears complete, it must provide the 
application and all pertinent information to the guaranty agency 
including, if available, the borrower's last date of attendance. If the 
borrower returns the application within 60 days, the lender must extend 
the period during which efforts to collect on the affected loan are 
suspended to the date the lender receives either a denial of the request 
or the unpaid refund amount from the guaranty agency. At the conclusion 
of the period during which the collection activity was suspended, the 
lender may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that 
period in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b).
    (iii) If the borrower fails to return the application within 60 
days, the holder of the loan resumes collection efforts and grants 
forbearance of principal and interest for the period during which the 
collection activity was suspended. The holder may capitalize any 
interest accrued and not paid during that period in accordance with 
Sec. 682.202(b).
    (iv) The guaranty agency may, with the approval of the Secretary, 
discharge a portion of a loan under this section without an application 
if the guaranty agency determines, based on information in the guaranty 
agency's possession, that the borrower qualifies for a discharge.
    (v) If the holder of the loan or the guaranty agency determines that 
the information contained in its files conflicts with the information 
provided by the borrower, the guaranty agency must use the most reliable 
information available to it to determine eligibility for and the 
appropriate payment of the refund amount.
    (vi) If the holder of the loan is the guaranty agency and the agency 
determines that the borrower qualifies for a discharge of an unpaid 
refund, the guaranty agency must suspend any efforts to collect on the 
affected loan and, within 30 days of its determination, discharge the 
appropriate amount and inform the borrower of its determination. Absent 
documentation of the exact amount of refund due the borrower, the 
guaranty agency must calculate the amount of the unpaid refund using the 
unpaid refund calculation defined in paragraph (o) of this section.
    (vii) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower does not 
qualify for an unpaid refund discharge, (or, if the holder is the lender 
and is informed by the guarantor that the borrower does not qualify for 
a discharge)--

[[Page 735]]

    (A) Within 30 days of the guarantor's determination, the agency must 
notify the borrower in writing of the reason for the determination and 
of the borrower's right to request a review of the agency's 
determination. The guaranty agency must make a determination within 30 
days of the borrower's submission of additional documentation supporting 
the borrower's eligibility that was not considered in any prior 
determination. During the review period, collection activities must be 
suspended; and
    (B) The holder must resume collection if the determination remains 
unchanged and grant forbearance of principal and interest for any period 
during which collection activity was suspended under this section. The 
holder may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during these 
periods in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b).
    (viii) If the guaranty agency determines that a current or former 
borrower at an open school may be eligible for a discharge under this 
section, the guaranty agency must notify the lender and the school of 
the unpaid refund allegation. The notice to the school must include all 
pertinent facts available to the guaranty agency regarding the alleged 
unpaid refund. The school must, no later than 60 days after receiving 
the notice, provide the guaranty agency with documentation 
demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the guarantor, that the alleged 
unpaid refund was either paid or not required to be paid.
    (ix) In the case of a school that does not make a refund or provide 
sufficient documentation demonstrating the refund was either paid or was 
not required, within 60 days of its receipt of the allegation notice 
from the guaranty agency, relief is provided to the borrower (and any 
endorser) if the guaranty agency determines the relief is appropriate. 
The agency must forward documentation of the school's failure to pay the 
unpaid refund to the Secretary.
    (m) Unpaid refund discharge procedures for a loan held by a lender. 
In the case of an unpaid refund discharge request, the lender must 
provide the guaranty agency with documentation related to the borrower's 
qualification for discharge as specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this 
section.
    (n) Payment of an unpaid refund discharge request by a guaranty 
agency. (1) General. The guaranty agency must review an unpaid refund 
discharge request promptly and must pay the lender the amount of loss as 
defined in paragraphs (l)(1) and (l)(2) of this section, related to the 
unpaid refund not later than 45 days after a properly filed request is 
made.
    (2) Determination of the unpaid refund discharge amount to the 
lender. The amount of loss payable to a lender on an unpaid refund 
includes that portion of an FFEL Program loan equal to the amount of the 
refund required under applicable Federal law and regulations, including 
this section, and including any accrued interest and other charges (late 
charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums) 
associated with the unpaid refund.
    (o)(1) Determination of amount eligible for discharge. The guaranty 
agency determines the amount eligible for discharge based on information 
showing the refund amount or by applying the appropriate refund formula 
to information that the borrower provides or that is otherwise available 
to the guaranty agency. For purposes of this section, all unpaid refunds 
are considered to be attributed to loan proceeds.
    (2) If the information in paragraph (o)(1) of this section is not 
available, the guaranty agency uses the following formulas to determine 
the amount eligible for discharge:
    (i) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal 
or termination date is before October 7, 2000 and who completes less 
than 60 percent of the loan period, the guaranty agency discharges the 
lesser of the institutional charges unearned or the loan amount. The 
guaranty agency determines the amount of the institutional charges 
unearned by--
    (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time in the loan period 
after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the 
loan period; and
    (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the institutional charges 
assessed the student for the loan period.

[[Page 736]]

    (ii) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose 
withdrawal or termination date is on or after October 7, 2000 and who 
completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the guaranty agency 
discharges the loan amount unearned. The guaranty agency determines the 
loan amount unearned by--
    (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the 
loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual 
length of the loan period; and
    (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the total amount of title IV 
grants and loans received by the student, or if unknown, the loan 
amount.
    (iii) In the case of a student who completes 60 percent or more of 
the loan period, the guaranty agency does not discharge any amount 
because a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period is 
not entitled to a refund.
    (p) Requests for reimbursement from the Secretary on loans held by 
guaranty agencies. The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency for its 
losses on unpaid refund request payments to lenders or borrowers in an 
amount that is equal to the amount specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this 
section.
    (q) Payments received after the guaranty agency's payment of an 
unpaid refund request. (1) The holder must promptly return to the sender 
any payment on a fully discharged loan, received after the guaranty 
agency pays an unpaid refund request unless the sender is required to 
pay (as in the case of a tuition recovery fund) in which case, the 
payment amount must be forwarded to the Secretary. At the same time that 
the holder returns the payment, it must notify the borrower that there 
is no obligation to repay a loan fully discharged.
    (2) If the holder has returned a payment to the borrower, or the 
borrower's representative, with the notice described in paragraph (q)(1) 
of this section, and the borrower (or representative) continues to send 
payments to the holder, the holder must remit all of those payments to 
the Secretary.
    (3) If the loan has not been fully discharged, payments must be 
applied to the remaining debt.
    (r) Payments received after the Secretary's payment of a death, 
disability, closed school, false certification, or bankruptcy claim.
    (1) If the guaranty agency receives any payments from or on behalf 
of the borrower on or attributable to a loan that as been discharged in 
bankruptcy on which the Secretary previously paid a bankruptcy claim, 
the guaranty agency must return 100 percent of these payments to the 
sender. The guaranty agency must promptly return, to the sender, any 
payment on a cancelled or discharged loan made by the sender and 
received after the Secretary pays a closed school or false certification 
claim. At the same time that the agency returns the payment, it must 
notify the borrower that there is no obligation to repay a loan 
discharged on the basis of death, bankruptcy, false certification, or 
closing of the school.
    (2) If the guaranty agency receives any payments from or on behalf 
of the borrower on or attributable to a loan that has been assigned to 
the Secretary for determination of eligibility for a total and permanent 
disability discharge, the guaranty agency must forward those payments to 
the Secretary for crediting to the borrower's account. At the same time 
that the agency forwards the payments, it must notify the borrower that 
there is no obligation to make payments on the loan while it is 
conditionally discharged prior to a final determination of eligibility 
for a total and permanent disability discharge, unless the Secretary 
directs the borrower otherwise.
    (3) When the Secretary makes a final determination to discharge the 
loan, the Secretary returns to the sender any payments received on the 
loan after the date the borrower became totally and permanently 
disabled.
    (4) The guaranty agency shall remit to the Secretary all payments 
received from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third 
party with respect to a loan on which the Secretary previously paid a 
closed school or false certification claim.

[[Page 737]]

    (5) If the guaranty agency has returned a payment to the borrower, 
or the borrower's representative, with the notice described in 
paragraphs (r)(1) or (r)(2) of this section, and the borrower (or 
representative) continues to send payments to the guaranty agency, the 
agency must remit all of those payments to the Secretary.
    (s) Applicable suspension of the repayment period. For purposes of 
this section and 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(A) with respect to loans guaranteed 
under the FFEL Program, an applicable suspension of the repayment 
period--
    (1) Includes any period during which the lender does not require the 
borrower to make a payment on the loan.
    (2) Begins on the date on which the borrower qualifies for the 
requested deferment as provided in Sec. 682.210(a)(5) or the lender 
grants the requested forbearance;
    (3) Closes on the later of the date on which--
    (i) The condition for which the requested deferment or forbearance 
was received ends; or
    (ii) The lender receives notice of the end of the condition for 
which the requested deferment or forbearance was received, if the 
condition ended earlier than represented by the borrower at the time of 
the request and the borrower did not notify timely the lender of the 
date on which the condition actually ended;
    (4) Includes the period between the end of the borrower's grace 
period and the first payment due date established by the lender in the 
case of a borrower who entered repayment without the knowledge of the 
lender;
    (5) Includes the period between the filing of the petition for 
relief and the date on which the proceeding is completed or dismissed, 
unless payments have been made during that period in amounts sufficient 
to meet the amount owed under the repayment schedule in effect when the 
petition was filed.

higher education.

[[Page 738]]

    (b) A guaranty agency shall apply to the Secretary in order to 
receive an initial advance.
    (c)(1) An advance may be made to a new guaranty agency for each of

<R05>
Sec. 682.404  Federal reinsurance agreement.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary may enter into a reinsurance 
agreement with a guaranty agency that has a basic program agreement. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, under a reinsurance 
agreement, the Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency for--
    (i) 95 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on 
loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 
1998;
    (ii) 98 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders 
for loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 
1, 1993, and before October 1, 1998; or
    (iii) 100 percent of its losses on default claim payments to 
lenders--
    (A) For loans for which the first disbursement is made prior to 
October 1, 1993;
    (B) For loans made under an approved lender-of-last-resort program;
    (C) For loans transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary 
from an insolvent guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws 
its participation in the FFEL Program;
    (D) For a guaranty agency that entered into a basic program 
agreement under section 428(b) of the Act after September 30, 1976, or 
was not actively carrying on a loan guarantee program covered by a basic 
program agreement on October 1, 1976 for five consecutive fiscal years 
beginning with the first year of its operation.
    (2) For purposes of this section--
    (i) Losses means the amount of unpaid principal and accrued interest 
the agency paid on a default claim filed by a lender on a reinsured 
loan, minus payments made by or on behalf of the borrower after default 
but before the Secretary reimburses the agency;
    (ii) Default aversion assistance means the activities of a guaranty 
agency that are designed to prevent a default by a borrower who is at 
least 60 days delinquent and that are directly related to providing 
collection assistance to the lender.
    (3) A guaranty agency's loss on a loan that was outstanding when a 
reinsurance agreement was executed is covered by the reinsurance 
agreement only if the default on the loan occurs after the effective 
date of the agreement.
    (4) If a lender has requested default aversion assistance as 
described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the agency must, upon 
request of the school at which the borrower received

[[Page 739]]

the loan, notify the school of the lender's request. The guaranty agency 
may not charge the school or the school's agent for providing this 
notification and must accept a blanket request from the school to be 
notified whenever any of the school's current or former students are the 
subject of a default aversion assistance request. The agency must notify 
schools annually of the option to make this blanket request.
    (b) Reduction in reinsurance rate. (1) If the total of reinsurance 
claims paid by the Secretary to a guaranty agency during any fiscal year 
reaches 5 percent of the amount of loans in repayment at the end of the 
preceding fiscal year, the Secretary's reinsurance payment on a default 
claim subsequently paid by the guaranty agency during that fiscal year 
equals--
    (i) 90 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on 
loans for which the first disbursement is made before October 1, 1993 or 
transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary from an insolvent 
guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws its participation in 
the FFEL Program;
    (ii) 88 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders 
on loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 
1993, and before October 1, 1998; or
    (iii) 85 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders 
on loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 
1998.
    (2) If the total of reinsurance claims paid by the Secretary to a 
guaranty agency during any fiscal year reaches 9 percent of the amount 
of loans in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year, the 
Secretary's reinsurance payment on a default claim subsequently paid by 
the guaranty agency during that fiscal year equals--
    (i) 80 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on 
loans for which the first disbursement is made before October 1, 1993 or 
transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary from an insolvent 
guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws its participation in 
the FFEL Program;
    (ii) 78 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders 
on loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 
1993, and before October 1, 1998; or
    (iii) 75 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders 
on loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 
1998.
    (3) For purposes of this section, the total of reinsurance claims 
paid by the Secretary to a guaranty agency during any fiscal year does 
not include amounts paid on claims by the guaranty agency--
    (i) On loans considered in default under Sec. 682.412(e);
    (ii) Under a policy established by the agency that is consistent 
with Sec. 682.509(a)(1); or
    (iii) That were filed by lenders at the direction of the Secretary;
    (iv) On loans made under a guaranty agency's approved lender-of-
last-resort program.
    (4) For purposes of this section, amount of loans in repayment 
means--
    (i) The sum of--
    (A) The original principal amount of all loans guaranteed by the 
agency; and
    (B) The original principal amount of any loans on which the 
guarantee was transferred to the agency from another agency;
    (ii) Minus the original principal amount of all loans on which--
    (A) The loan guarantee was canceled;
    (B) The loan guarantee was transferred to another agency;
    (C) The borrower has not yet reached the repayment period;
    (D) Payment in full has been made by the borrower;
    (E) The borrower was in deferment status at the time repayment was 
scheduled to begin and remains in deferment status;
    (F) Reinsurance coverage has been lost and cannot be regained; and
    (G) The agency paid claims, excluding the amount of those claims--
    (1) Paid under Sec. 682.412(e);
    (2) Paid under a policy established by the agency that is consistent 
with Sec. 682.509(a)(1); or
    (3) Paid at the direction of the Secretary.
    (c) Submission of reinsurance rate base data. The guaranty agency 
shall submit to the Secretary the quarterly report required by the 
Secretary for the

[[Page 740]]

previous quarter ending September 30 containing complete and accurate 
data in order for the Secretary to calculate the amount of loans in 
repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year. The Secretary does 
not pay a reinsurance claim to the guaranty agency after the date the 
guarterly report is due until the quaranty agency submits a complete and 
accurate report.
    (d) Reinsurance fee. (1) Except for loans made under 
Sec. 682.209(e), (f) and (h), and all loans guaranteed on or after 
October 1, 1993, a guaranty agency shall pay to the Secretary during 
each fiscal year in quarterly installments a reinsurance fee equal to--
    (i) 0.25 percent of the total principal amount of the Stafford, SLS, 
and PLUS loans on which guarantees were issued by that agency during 
that fiscal year; or
    (ii) 0.5 percent of the total principal amount of the Stafford, SLS, 
and PLUS loans on which guarantees were issued by that agency during 
that fiscal year if the agency's reinsurance claims paid reach the 
amount described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section at any time during 
that fiscal year.
    (2) The agency that is the original guarantor of a loan shall pay 
the reinsurance fee to the Secretary even if the guaranty agency 
transfers its guarantee obligation on the loan to another guaranty 
agency.
    (3) The guaranty agency shall pay the reinsurance fee required by 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section due the Secretary for each calendar 
quarter ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, within 
90 days after the end of the applicable quarter or within 30 days after 
receiving written notice from the Secretary that the fees are due, 
whichever is earlier.
    (e) Initiation or extension of agreements. In deciding whether to 
enter into or extend a reinsurance agreement, or, if an agreement has 
been terminated, whether to enter into a new agreement, the Secretary 
considers the adequacy of--
    (1) Efforts by the guaranty agency and the lenders to which it 
provides guarantees to collect outstanding loans as required by 
Sec. 682.410(b) (6) or (7), and Sec. 682.411;
    (2) Efforts by the guaranty agency to make FFEL loans available to 
all eligible borrowers; and
    (3) Other relevant aspects of the guaranty agency's program 
operations.
    (f) Application of borrower payments. A payment made to a guaranty 
agency by a borrower on a defaulted loan must be applied first to the 
collection costs incurred to collect that amount and then to other 
incidental charges, such as late charges, then to accrued interest and 
then to principal.
    (g) Share of borrower payments returned to the Secretary. (1) After 
an agency pays a default claim to a holder using assets of the Federal 
Fund, the agency must pay to the Secretary the portion of payments 
received on those defaulted loans remaining after--
    (i) The agency deposits into the Federal Fund the amount of those 
payments equal to the applicable complement of the reinsurance 
percentage that was in effect at the time the claim was paid; and
    (ii) The agency has deducted an amount equal to--
    (A) 30 percent of borrower payments received before October 1, 1993;
    (B) 27 percent of borrower payments received on or after October 1, 
1993, and before October 1, 1998;
    (C) 24 percent of borrower payments received on or after October 1, 
1998, and before October 1, 2003; and
    (D) 23 percent of borrower payments received on or after October 1, 
2003.
    (2) Unless the Secretary approves otherwise, the guaranty agency 
must pay to the Secretary the Secretary's share of borrower payments 
within 45 days of its receipt of the payments.
    (h) Nondiscrimination. (1) A guaranty agency may not engage in any 
pattern or practice that results in a denial of a borrower's access to 
FFEL loans because of the borrower's race, sex, color, religion, 
national origin, age, handicapped status, income, attendance at a 
particular participating school within any State served by the guaranty 
agency, length of the borrower's educational program, or the borrower's 
academic year in school.
    (2) For purposes of this section a guaranty agency is deemed to be 
serving a State if it guarantees a loan that is--

[[Page 741]]

    (i) Made by a lender located in a State not served by the agency;
    (ii) Made to a borrower who is a resident of a State not served by 
the agency; and
    (iii) Made for attendance at a school located in the State.
    (i) Account maintenance fee. A guaranty agency is paid an account 
maintenance fee based on the original principal amount of outstanding 
FFEL Program loans insured by the agency. For fiscal years 1999 and 
2000, the fee is 0.12 percent of the original principal amount of 
outstanding loans. After fiscal year 2000, the fee is 0.10 percent of 
the original principal amount of outstanding loans.
    (j) Loan processing and issuance fee. A guaranty agency is paid a 
loan processing and issuance fee based on the principal amount of FFEL 
Program loans originated during a fiscal year that are insured by the 
agency. The fee is paid quarterly. No payment is made for loans for 
which the disbursement checks have not been cashed or for which 
electronic funds transfers have not been completed. For fiscal years 
1999 through 2003, the fee is 0.65 percent of the principal amount of 
loans originated. Beginning October 1, 2003, the fee is 0.40 percent.
    (k) Default aversion fee--(1) General. If a guaranty agency performs 
default aversion activities on a delinquent loan in response to a 
lender's request for default aversion assistance on that loan, the 
agency receives a default aversion fee. The fee may not be paid more 
than once on any loan. The lender's request for assistance must be 
submitted to the guaranty agency no earlier than the 60th day and no 
later than the 120th day of the borrower's delinquency. A guaranty 
agency may not restrict a lender's choice of the date during this period 
on which the lender submits a request for default aversion assistance.
    (2) Amount of fees transferred. No more frequently than monthly, a 
guaranty agency may transfer default aversion fees from the Federal Fund 
to its Operating Fund. The amount of the fees that may be transferred is 
equal to--
    (i) One percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest owed on 
loans that were submitted by lenders to the agency for default aversion 
assistance; minus
    (ii) One percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest owed 
by borrowers on default claims that--
    (A) Were paid by the agency for the same time period for which the 
agency transferred default aversion fees from its Federal Fund; and
    (B) For which default aversion fees have been received by the 
agency.
    (3) Calculation of fee. (i) For purposes of calculating the one 
percent default aversion fee described in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this 
section, the agency must use the total unpaid principal and accrued 
interest owed by the borrower as of the date the default aversion 
assistance request is submitted by the lender.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
agency must use the total unpaid principal and accrued interest owed by 
the borrower as of the date the agency paid the default claim.
    (4) Prohibition against conflicts. If a guaranty agency contracts 
with an outside entity to perform any default aversion activities, that 
outside entity may not--
    (i) Hold or service the loan; or
    (ii) Perform collection activities on the loan in the event of 
default within 3 years of the claim payment date.
    (l) Other terms. The reinsurance agreement contains other terms and 
conditions that the Secretary finds necessary to--
    (1) Promote the purposes of the FFEL programs and to protect the 
United States from unreasonable risks of loss;
    (2) Ensure proper and efficient administration of the loan guarantee 
program; and
    (3) Ensure that due diligence will be exercised in the collection of 
loans.

Sec. 682.405  Loan rehabilitation agreement.

    (a) General. (1) A guaranty agency that has a basic program 
agreement must enter into a loan rehabilitation agreement with the 
Secretary. The guaranty agency must establish a loan rehabilitation 
program for all borrowers with an enforceable promissory note for the 
purpose of rehabilitating defaulted loans so that the loan may be 
purchased, if practicable, by an eligible lender and removed from 
default status.
    (2) A loan is considered to be rehabilitated only after the borrower 
has made one voluntary reasonable and affordable full payment each month 
and the payment is received by a guaranty agency or its agent within 15 
days of the scheduled due date for 12 consecutive months in accordance 
with this section, and the loan has been sold to an eligible lender.
    (3) After the loan has been rehabilitated, the borrower regains all 
benefits of the program, including any remaining deferment eligibility 
under section 428(b)(1)(M) of the Act, from the date of the 
rehabilitation.
    (4) A borrower who wishes to rehabilitate a loan on which a judgment 
has been entered must sign a new promissory note prior to the sale of 
the loan to an eligible lender.
    (b) Terms of agreement. In the loan rehabilitation agreement, the 
guaranty agency agrees to ensure that its loan rehabilitation program 
meets the following requirements at all times:
    (1) A borrower may request the rehabilitation of the borrower's 
defaulted FFEL loan held by the guaranty agency. The borrower must make 
one on-time voluntary full payment each month for 12 consecutive months 
to be eligible to have the defaulted loans rehabilitated. For purposes 
of this section, ``full payment'' means a reasonable and affordable 
payment agreed to by the borrower and the agency. The required amount of 
such monthly payment may be no more than is reasonable and affordable 
based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. Voluntary 
payments are those made directly by the borrower regardless of whether 
there is a judgment against the borrower, and do not include payments 
obtained by income tax off-set, garnishment, or income or asset 
execution. A guaranty agency must attempt to secure a lender to purchase 
the loan at the end of the twelve-(12-)month payment period.
    (i) For purposes of this section, the determination of reasonable 
and affordable must--
    (A) Include a consideration of the borrower's and spouse's 
disposable income and reasonable and necessary expenses including, but 
not limited to, housing, utilities, food, medical costs, work-related 
expenses, dependent care costs and other Title IV repayment;
    (B) Not be a required minimum payment amount, e.g. $50, if the 
agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable 
based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. The agency must 
include documentation in the borrower's file of the basis for the 
determination if the monthly reasonable and affordable payment 
established under this section is less than $50.00 or the monthly 
accrued interest on the loan, whichever is greater. However, $50.00 may 
not be the minimum payment for a borrower if the agency determines that 
a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable; and
    (C) Be based on the documentation provided by the borrower or other 
sources including, but not be limited to--
    (1) Evidence of current income (e.g., proof of welfare benefits, 
Social Security benefits, child support, veterans' benefits, 
Supplemental Security Income, Workmen's Compensation, two most recent 
pay stubs, most recent copy of U.S. income tax return, State Department 
of Labor reports);
    (2) Evidence of current expenses (e.g., a copy of the borrower's 
monthly household budget, on a form provided by the guaranty agency); 
and
    (3) A statement of the unpaid balance on all FFEL loans held by 
other holders.
    (ii) The agency must include any payment made under 
Sec. 682.401(b)(4) in determining whether the 12 consecutive payments 
required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been made.

[[Page 743]]

    (iii) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be 
adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial circumstances 
only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(C) of this section.
    (iv) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a written 
statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment 
amount, as determined by the agency, and explaining any other terms and 
conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be 
made before a borrower's account can be considered for repurchase by an 
eligible lender. The statement must inform borrowers of the effects of 
having their loans rehabilitated (e.g. credit clearing, possibility of 
increased monthly payments). The statement must inform the borrower of 
the amount of the collection costs to be added to the unpaid principal 
at the time of the sale. The collection costs may not exceed 18.5 
percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest at the time of the 
sale.
    (v) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with an opportunity 
to object to terms of the rehabilitation of the borrower's defaulted 
loan.
    (2) The guaranty agency must report to all national credit bureaus 
within 90 days of the date the loan was rehabilitated that the loan is 
no longer in a default status and that the default is to be removed from 
the borrower's credit history.
    (3) An eligible lender purchasing a rehabilitated loan must 
establish a repayment schedule that meets the same requirements that are 
applicable to other FFEL Program loans made under the same loan type and 
provides for the borrower to make monthly payments at least as great as 
the average of the 12 consecutive monthly payments received by the 
guaranty agency. For the purposes of the maximum loan repayment period, 
the lender must treat the first payment made under the 12 consecutive 
payments as the first payment under the applicable maximum repayment 
term, as defined under sections 682.209(a) or (h).

the lender files a claim for loss on the loan with the guarantor 
together with all required documentation, prior to the 30th day;

to this part.
    (c) In evaluating a claim for insurance or reinsurance, the issue of 
confirmation of subsequent loans under an MPN will not be reviewed and a 
claim will not be denied based on the absence of any evidence relating

confirmation process or processes, insurance and reinsurance benefits 
must be repaid.

<R05>
Sec. 682.409  Mandatory assignment by guaranty agencies of defaulted loans to the Secretary.

    (a)(1) If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to 
protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary directs a guaranty 
agency to promptly assign to the Secretary any loans held by the agency 
on which the agency has received payment under Sec. 682.402(f), 
682.402(k), or 682.404. The collection of unpaid loans owed by Federal 
employees by Federal salary offset is, among other things, deemed to be 
in the Federal fiscal interest. Unless the Secretary notifies an agency, 
in writing, that other loans must be assigned to the Secretary, an 
agency must assign any loan that meets all of the following criteria as 
of April 15 of each year:
    (i) The unpaid principal balance is at least $100.
    (ii) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in 
which these regulations are effective, the loan, and any other loans 
held by the agency for that borrower, have been held by the agency for 
at least four years; for any subsequent fiscal year such loan must have 
been held by the agency for at least five years.
    (iii) A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year.
    (iv) A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the 
borrower.
    (2) If the agency fails to meet a fiscal year recovery rate standard 
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for a loan type, and the 
Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to 
protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the 
agency to assign in addition to those loans described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, loans in amounts needed to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(3)(i) of this section.

[[Page 746]]

    (i) Calculation of fiscal year loan type recovery rate. A fiscal 
year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the 
amount collected on defaulted loans, including collections by Federal 
Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford, 
PLUS, SLS, and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of 
that program (including payments received by the agency on loans under 
Sec. 682.401(b)(4) and Sec. 682.409 and the amounts of any loans 
purchased from the guaranty agency by an eligible lender) during the 
most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of 
principal and interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each 
loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts 
permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal 
year.
    (ii) Fiscal year loan type recovery rates standards. (A) If, in each 
of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these 
regulations are effective, the fiscal year loan type recovery rate for a 
loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery 
rate of all active guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal 
years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that 
additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal 
interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional 
assignments in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (B) In any subsequent fiscal year the loan type recovery rate 
standard for a loan program must be 90 percent of the average recovery 
rate of all active guaranty agencies.
    (iii) Non-achievement of loan type recovery rate standards.
    (A) Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of 
this section that protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires 
that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an 
agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate described in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the Secretary a 
sufficient amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans to be 
assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to cause 
the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal year 
to equal or exceed the average rate of all agencies described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from 
the denominator of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the 
amount of these additional loans.
    (B) The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may 
require the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section to include particular categories of loans that share 
characteristics that make the performance of the agency fall below the 
appropriate percentage of the loan type recovery rate as described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Calculation of loan type recovery rate standards. The 
Secretary, within 30 days after the date for submission of the second 
quarterly report from all agencies, makes available to all agencies a 
mid-year report, showing the recovery rate for each agency and the 
average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies for each loan 
type. In addition, the Secretary, within 120 days after the beginning of 
each fiscal year, makes available a final report showing those rates and 
the average rate for each loan type for the preceding fiscal year.
    (3)(i) Determination that the protection of the Federal fiscal 
interest requires assignments. Upon petition by an agency submitted 
within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of 
this section, the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal 
fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans described in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount 
described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section only after review of 
the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary 
considers all relevant information available to him (including any 
information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in reviews of 
the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows:
    (A) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in 
which these regulations are effective, the Secretary considers 
information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery 
rate above the average rate of

[[Page 747]]

all active agencies to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal 
fiscal interest will be served if any amounts of loans of the loan type 
required to be assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section are retained by that agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the 
Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal 
year recovery rate 10 percent above the average rate of all active 
agencies.
    (B) The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that 
is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to 
demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be 
served if the agency demonstrates that its compliance with 
Sec. 682.401(b)(4) and Sec. 682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal 
year loan type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required 
to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be assigned.
    (C) The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include, but is not limited to 
the following:
    (1) The fiscal year loan type recovery rate within such school 
sectors as the Secretary may designate for the agency, and for all 
agencies.
    (2) The fiscal year loan type recovery rate for loans for the agency 
and for all agencies categorized by age of the loans as the Secretary 
may determine.
    (3) The performance of the agency, and all agencies, in default 
aversion.
    (4) The agency's performance on judgment enforcement.
    (5) The existence and use of any state or guaranty agency-specific 
collection tools.
    (6) The agency's level of compliance with Secs. 682.409 and 
682.410(b)(6).
    (7) Other factors that may affect loan repayment such as State or 
regional unemployment and natural disasters.
    (ii) Denial of an agency's petition. If the Secretary does not 
accept the agency's petition, the Secretary provides, in writing, to the 
agency the Secretary's reasons for concluding that the Federal fiscal 
interest is best protected by requiring the assignment.
    (b)(1) A guaranty agency that assigns a defaulted loan to the 
Secretary under this section thereby releases all rights and title to 
that loan. The Secretary does not pay the guaranty agency any 
compensation for a loan assigned under this section.
    (2) The guaranty agency does not share in any amounts received by 
the Secretary on a loan assigned under this section, regardless of the 
reinsurance percentage paid on the loan or the agency's previous 
collection costs.
    (c)(1) A guaranty agency must assign a loan to the Secretary under 
this section at the time, in the manner, and with the information and 
documentation that the Secretary requires. The agency must submit this 
information and documentation in the form (including magnetic media) and 
format specified by the Secretary.
    (2) The guaranty agency must execute an assignment to the United 
States of America of all right, title, and interest in the promissory 
note or judgment evidencing a loan assigned under this section. If more 
than one loan is made under an MPN, the assignment of the note only 
applies to the loan or loans being assigned to the Secretary.
    (3) If the agency does not provide the required information and 
documentation in the form and format required by the Secretary, the 
Secretary may, at his option--
    (i) Allow the agency to revise the agency's submission to include 
the required information and documentation in the specified form and 
format;
    (ii) In the case of an improperly formatted computer tape, reformat 
the tape and assess the cost of the activity against the agency;
    (iii) Reorganize the material submitted and assess the cost of that 
activity against the agency; or
    (iv) Obtain from other agency records and add to the agency's 
submission any information from the original submission, and assess the 
cost of that activity against the agency.
    (4) For each loan assigned, the agency shall submit to the Secretary 
the following documents associated for each loan, assembled in the order 
listed below:
    (i) The original or a true and exact copy of the promissory note.

[[Page 748]]

    (ii) Any documentation of a judgment entered on the loan.
    (iii) A written assignment of the loan or judgment, unless this 
assignment is affixed to the promissory note.
    (iv) The loan application, if a separate application was provided to 
the lender.
    (v) A payment history for the loan, as described in 
Sec. 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(C).
    (vi) A collection history for the loan, as described in 
Sec. 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(D).
    (5) The agency may submit copies of required documents in lieu of 
originals.
    (6) The Secretary may accept the assignment of a loan without all of 
the documents listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If directed to 
do so, the agency must retain these documents for submission to the 
Secretary at some future date.
    (d)(1) If the Secretary determines that the agency has not submitted 
a document or record required by paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Secretary decides to allow the agency an additional opportunity to 
submit the omitted document under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, 
the Secretary notifies the agency and provides a reasonable period of 
time for the agency to submit the omitted record or document.
    (2) If the omitted document is not submitted within the time 
specified by the Secretary, the Secretary determines whether that 
omission impairs the Secretary's ability to collect the loan.
    (3) If the Secretary determines that the ability to collect the loan 
has been impaired under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Secretary 
assesses the agency the amount paid to the agency under the reinsurance 
agreement and accrued interest at the rate applicable to the borrower 
under Sec. 682.410(b)(3).
    (4) The Secretary reassigns to the agency that portion of the loan 
determined to be unenforceable by the Department.

    (A) Allocable to the FFEL Program;
    (B) Not higher than the agency would incur under established 
policies, regulations, and procedures that apply to any comparable non-
Federal activities of the guaranty agency;
    (C) Not included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching 
requirements of any other federally supported activity, except as 
specifically provided by Federal law;
    (D) Net of all applicable credits; and
    (E) Documented in accordance with applicable legal and accounting 
standards;
    (iii) The Secretary's equitable share of collections;
    (iv) Federal advances and other funds owed to the Secretary;
    (v) Reinsurance fees;
    (vi) Insurance premiums related to cancelled loans;
    (vii) Borrower refunds, including those arising out of student or 
other borrower claims and defenses;
    (viii) (A) The repayment, on or after December 29, 1993, of amounts 
credited under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(1)(ix) of this section, if 
the agency provides the Secretary 30 days prior notice of the repayment 
and demonstrates that--
    (1) These amounts were originally received by the agency under 
appropriate contemporaneous documentation specifying that receipt was on 
a temporary basis only;
    (2) The objective for which these amounts were originally received 
by the agency has been fully achieved; and
    (3) Repayment of these amounts would not cause the agency to fail to 
comply with the minimum reserve levels provided by paragraph (a)(10) of 
this section, except that the Secretary may, for good cause, provide 
written permission for a payment that meets the other requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A).
    (B) The repayment, prior to December 29, 1993, of amounts credited 
under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(1)(ix) of this section, if the agency 
demonstrates that--
    (1) These amounts were originally received by the agency under 
appropriate contemporaneous documentation that receipt was on a 
temporary basis only; and
    (2) The objective for which these amounts were originally received 
by the agency has been fully achieved.
    (ix) Any other costs or payments ordinary and necessary to perform 
functions directly related to the agency's responsibilities under the 
HEA and for their proper and efficient administration;
    (x) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any other 
payment that was allowed by law or regulation at the time it was made, 
if the agency acted in good faith when it made the payment or the agency 
would otherwise be unfairly prejudiced by the nonallowability of the 
payment at a later time; and
    (xi) Any other amounts authorized or directed by the Secretary.
    (3) Accounting basis. Except as approved by the Secretary, a 
guaranty agency shall credit the items listed in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section to its reserve fund upon their receipt, without any 
deferral for accounting purposes, and shall deduct the items listed in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section from its reserve fund upon their 
payment, without any accrual for accounting purposes.
    (4) Accounting records. (i) The accounting records of a guaranty 
agency must reflect the correct amount of sources and uses of funds 
under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) A guaranty agency may reverse prior credits to its reserve fund 
if--
    (A) The agency gives the Secretary prior notice setting forth a 
detailed justification for the action;
    (B) The Secretary determines that such credits were made erroneously 
and in good faith; and
    (C) The Secretary determines that the action would not unfairly 
prejudice other parties.

[[Page 750]]

    (iii) A guaranty agency shall correct any other errors in its 
accounting or reporting as soon as practicable after the errors become 
known to the agency.
    (iv) If a general reconstruction of a guaranty agency's historical 
accounting records is necessary to make a change under paragraphs 
(a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of this section or any other retroactive 
change to its accounting records, the agency may make this 
reconstruction only upon prior approval by the Secretary and without any 
deduction from its reserve fund for the cost of the reconstruction.
    (5) Investments. The guaranty agency shall exercise the level of 
care required of a fiduciary charged with the duty of investing the 
money of others when it invests the assets of the reserve fund described 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. It may invest these assets only in 
low-risk securities, such as obligations issued or guaranteed by the 
United States or a State.
    (6) Development of assets. (i) If the guaranty agency uses in a 
substantial way for purposes other than the agency's guaranty activities 
any funds required to be credited to the reserve fund under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section or any assets derived from the reserve fund to 
develop an asset of any kind and does not in good faith allocate a 
portion of the cost of developing and maintaining the developed asset to 
funds other than the reserve fund, the Secretary may require the agency 
to--
    (A) Correct this allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section; or
    (B) Correct the recorded ownership of the asset under paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii) of this section so that--
    (1) If, in a transaction with an unrelated third party, the agency 
sells or otherwise derives revenue from uses of the asset that are 
unrelated to the agency's guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall 
deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section a percentage of the sale proceeds or revenue equal to the fair 
percentage of the total development cost of the asset paid with the 
reserve fund monies or provided by assets derived from the reserve fund; 
or
    (2) If the agency otherwise converts the asset, in whole or in part, 
to a use unrelated to its guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall 
deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section a fair percentage of the fair market value or, in the case of a 
temporary conversion, the rental value of the portion of the asset 
employed for the unrelated use.
    (ii) If the agency uses funds or assets described in paragraph 
(a)(6)(i) of this section in the manner described in that paragraph and 
makes a cost and maintenance allocation erroneously and in good faith, 
it shall correct the allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section.
    (7) Third-party claims. If the guaranty agency has any claim against 
any other party to recover funds or other assets for the reserve fund, 
the claim is the property of the United States.
    (8) Related-party transactions. All transactions between a guaranty 
agency and a related organization or other person that involve funds 
required to be credited to the agency's reserve fund under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section or assets derived from the reserve fund must be 
on terms that are not less advantageous to the reserve fund than would 
have been negotiated on an arm's-length basis by unrelated parties.
    (9) Scope of definition. The provisions of this Sec. 682.410(a) 
define reserve funds and assets for purposes of sections 422 and 428 of 
the Act. These provisions do not, however, affect the Secretary's 
authority to use all funds and assets of the agency pursuant to section 
428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the Act.
    (10) Minimum reserve fund level. The guaranty agency must maintain a 
current minimum reserve level of not less than--
    (i) .5 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal 
year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1993;
    (ii) .7 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal 
year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1994;
    (iii) .9 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal 
year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1995; and
    (iv) 1.1 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for each fiscal 
year

[[Page 751]]

of the agency that begins on or after January 1, 1996.
    (11) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (i) Reserve fund level means--
    (A) The total of reserve fund assets as defined in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section;
    (B) Minus the total amount of the reserve fund assets used in 
accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section; and
    (ii) Amount of loans outstanding means--
    (A) The sum of--
    (1) The original principal amount of all loans guaranteed by the 
agency; and
    (2) The original principal amount of any loans on which the 
guarantee was transferred to the agency from another guarantor, 
excluding loan guarantees transferred to another agency pursuant to a 
plan of the Secretary in response to the insolvency of the agency;
    (B) Minus the original principal amount of all loans on which--
    (1) The loan guarantee was cancelled;
    (2) The loan guarantee was transferred to another agency;
    (3) Payment in full has been made by the borrower;
    (4) Reinsurance coverage has been lost and cannot be regained; and
    (5) The agency paid claims.
    (iii) Reasonable cost means a cost that, in its nature and amount, 
does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under 
the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur 
the cost. The burden of proof is upon the guaranty agency, as a 
fiduciary under its agreements with the Secretary, to establish that 
costs are reasonable. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, 
consideration must be given to--
    (A) Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary 
and necessary for the proper and efficient performance and 
administration of the guaranty agency's responsibilities under the HEA;
    (B) The restraints or requirements imposed by factors such as sound 
business practices, arms-length bargaining, Federal, State, and other 
laws and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the guaranty 
agency's agreements with the Secretary; and
    (C) Market prices of comparable goods or services.
    (b) Administrative requirements--(1) Independent audits. The 
guaranty agency shall arrange for an independent financial and 
compliance audit of the agency's FFEL program as follows:
    (i) With regard to a guaranty agency that is an agency of a State 
government, an audit must be conducted in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 
and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G.
    (ii) With regard to a guaranty agency that is a nonprofit 
organization, an audit must be conducted in accordance with OMB Circular 
A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit 
Organizations and 34 CFR 74.61(h)(3). If a nonprofit guaranty agency 
meets the criteria in Circular A-133 to have a program specific audit, 
and chooses that option, the program specific audit must meet the 
following requirements:
    (A) The audit must examine the agency's compliance with the Act, 
applicable regulations, and agreements entered into under this part.
    (B) The audit must examine the agency's financial management of its 
FFEL program activities.
    (C) The audit must be conducted in accordance with the standards for 
audits issued by the United States General Accounting Office's (GAO) 
Government Auditing Standards. Procedures for audits are contained in an 
audit guide developed by, and available from, the Office of the 
Inspector General of the Department.
    (D) The audit must be conducted annually and must be submitted to 
the Secretary within six months of the end of the audit period. The 
first audit must cover the agency's activities for a period that 
includes July 23, 1992, unless the agency is currently submitting audits 
on a biennial basis, and the second year of its biennial cycle starts on 
or before July 23, 1992. Under these circumstances, the agency shall 
submit a biennial audit that includes July 23, 1992 and submit its next 
audit as an annual audit.
    (2) Collection charges. Whether or not provided for in the 
borrower's promissory note and subject to any limitation

[[Page 752]]

on the amount of those costs in that note, the guaranty agency shall 
charge a borrower an amount equal to reasonable costs incurred by the 
agency in collecting a loan on which the agency has paid a default or 
bankruptcy claim. These costs may include, but are not limited to, all 
attorney's fees, collection agency charges, and court costs. Except as 
provided in Secs. 682.401(b)(27) and 682.405(b)(1)(iv), the amount 
charged a borrower must equal the lesser of--
    (i) The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of 
collection under the formula in 34 CFR 30.60; or
    (ii) The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of 
collection if the loan was held by the U.S. Department of Education.
    (3) Interest charged by guaranty agencies. The guaranty agency shall 
charge the borrower interest on the amount owed by the borrower after 
the capitalization required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section has 
occurred at a rate that is the greater of--
    (i) The rate established by the terms of the borrower's original 
promissory note;
    (ii) In the case of a loan for which a judgment has been obtained, 
the rate provided for by State law.
    (4) Capitalization of unpaid interest. The guaranty agency shall 
capitalize any unpaid interest due the lender from the borrower at the 
time the agency pays a default claim to the lender.
    (5) Credit bureau reports. (i) After the completion of the 
procedures in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the guaranty agency 
shall, after it has paid a default claim, report promptly, but not less 
than sixty days after completion of the procedures in paragraph 
(b)(6)(v) of this section, and on a regular basis, to all national 
credit bureaus--
    (A) The total amount of loans made to the borrower and the remaining 
balance of those loans;
    (B) The date of default;
    (C) Information concerning collection of the loan, including the 
repayment status of the loan;
    (D) Any changes or corrections in the information reported by the 
agency that result from information received after the initial report; 
and
    (E) The date the loan is fully repaid by or on behalf of the 
borrower or discharged by reason of the borrower's death, bankruptcy, 
total and permanent disability, or closed school or false certification.
    (ii) The guaranty agency, after it pays a default claim on a loan 
but before it reports the default to a credit bureau or assesses 
collection costs against a borrower, shall, within the timeframe 
specified in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, provide the borrower 
with--
    (A) Written notice that meets the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(5)(vi) of this section regarding the proposed actions;
    (B) An opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to 
the loan obligation;
    (C) An opportunity for an administrative review of the legal 
enforceability or past-due status of the loan obligation; and
    (D) An opportunity to enter into a repayment agreement on terms 
satisfactory to the agency.
    (iii) The procedures set forth in 34 CFR 30.20-30.33 (administrative 
offset) satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iv)(A) In response to a request submitted by a borrower, after the 
deadlines established under agency rules, for access to records, an 
administrative review, or for an opportunity to enter into a repayment 
agreement, the agency shall provide the requested relief but may 
continue reporting the debt to credit bureaus until it determines that 
the borrower has demonstrated that the loan obligation is not legally 
enforceable or that alternative repayment arrangements satisfactory to 
the agency have been made with the borrower.
    (B) The deadline established by the agency for requesting 
administrative review under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section must 
allow the borrower at least 60 days from the date the notice described 
in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section is sent to request that 
review.
    (v) An agency may not permit an employee, official, or agent to 
conduct the

[[Page 753]]

administrative review required under this paragraph if that individual 
is--
    (A) Employed in an organizational component of the agency or its 
agent that is charged with collection of loan obligations; or
    (B) Compensated on the basis of collections on loan obligations.
    (vi) The notice sent by the agency under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of 
this section must--
    (A) Advise the borrower that the agency has paid a default claim 
filed by the lender and has taken assignment of the loan;
    (B) Identify the lender that made the loan and the school for 
attendance at which the loan was made;
    (C) State the outstanding principal, accrued interest, and any other 
charges then owing on the loan;
    (D) Demand that the borrower immediately begin repayment of the 
loan;
    (E) Explain the rate of interest that will accrue on the loan, that 
all costs incurred to collect the loan will be charged to the borrower, 
the authority for assessing these costs, and the manner in which the 
agency will calculate the amount of these costs;
    (F) Notify the borrower that the agency will report the default to 
all national credit bureaus to the detriment of the borrower's credit 
rating;
    (G) Explain the opportunities available to the borrower under agency 
rules to request access to the agency's records on the loan, to request 
an administrative review of the legal enforceability or past-due status 
of the loan, and to reach an agreement on repayment terms satisfactory 
to the agency to prevent the agency from reporting the loan as defaulted 
to credit bureaus and provide deadlines and method for requesting this 
relief;
    (H) Unless the agency uses a separate notice to advise the borrower 
regarding other proposed enforcement actions, describe specifically any 
other enforcement action, such as offset against Federal or state income 
tax refunds or wage garnishment that the agency intends to use to 
collect the debt, and explain the procedures available to the borrower 
prior to those other enforcement actions for access to records, for an 
administrative review, or for agreement to alternative repayment terms;
    (I) Describe the grounds on which the borrower may object that the 
loan obligation as stated in the notice is not a legally enforceable 
debt owed by the borrower;
    (J) Describe any appeal rights available to the borrower from an 
adverse decision on administrative review of the loan obligation;
    (K) Describe any right to judicial review of an adverse decision by 
the agency regarding the legal enforceability or past-due status of the 
loan obligation; and
    (L) Describe the collection actions that the agency may take in the 
future if those presently proposed do not result in repayment of the 
loan obligation, including the filing of a lawsuit against the borrower 
by the agency and assignment of the loan to the Secretary for the filing 
of a lawsuit against the borrower by the Federal Government.
    (vii) As part of the guaranty agency's response to a borrower who 
appeals an adverse decision resulting from the agency's administrative 
review of the loan obligation, the agency must provide the borrower with 
information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.
    (6) Collection efforts on defaulted loans. (i) A guaranty agency 
must engage in reasonable and documented collection activities on a loan 
on which it pays a default claim filed by a lender. For a non-paying 
borrower, the agency must perform at least one activity every 180 days 
to collect the debt, locate the borrower (if necessary), or determine if 
the borrower has the means to repay the debt.
    (ii) A guaranty agency must attempt an annual Federal offset against 
all eligible borrowers. If an agency initiates proceedings to offset a 
borrower's State or Federal income tax refunds and other payments made 
by the Federal Government to the borrower, it may not initiate those 
proceedings sooner than 60 days after sending the notice described in 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (iii) A guaranty agency must initiate administrative wage 
garnishment proceedings against all eligible borrowers, except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section, by following

[[Page 754]]

the procedures described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
    (iv) A guaranty agency may file a civil suit against a borrower to 
compel repayment only if the borrower has no wages that can be garnished 
under paragraph (b)(9) of this section, or the agency determines that 
the borrower has sufficient attachable assets or income that is not 
subject to administrative wage garnishment that can be used to repay the 
debt, and the use of litigation would be more effective in collection of 
the debt.
    (v) Within 45 days after paying a lender's default claim, the agency 
must send a notice to the borrower that contains the information 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. During this time 
period, the agency also must notify the borrower, either in the notice 
containing the information described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section, or in a separate notice, that if he or she does not make 
repayment arrangements acceptable to the agency, the agency will 
promptly initiate procedures to collect the debt. The agency's 
notification to the borrower must state that the agency may 
administratively garnish the borrower's wages, file a civil suit to 
compel repayment, offset the borrower's State and Federal income tax 
refunds and other payments made by the Federal Government to the 
borrower, assign the loan to the Secretary in accordance with 
Sec. 682.409, and take other lawful collection means to collect the 
debt, at the discretion of the agency. The agency's notification must 
include a statement that borrowers may have certain legal rights in the 
collection of debts, and that borrowers may wish to contact counselors 
or lawyers regarding those rights.
    (vi) Within a reasonable time after all of the information described 
in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section has been sent, the agency must 
send at least one notice informing the borrower that the default has 
been reported to all national credit bureaus (if that is the case) and 
that the borrower's credit rating may thereby have been damaged.
    (7) Special conditions for agency payment of a claim. (i) A guaranty 
agency may adopt a policy under which it pays a claim to a lender on a 
loan under the conditions described in Sec. 682.509(a)(1).
    (ii) Upon the payment of a claim under a policy described in 
paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, the guaranty agency shall--
    (A) Perform the loan servicing functions required of a lender under 
Sec. 682.208, except that the agency is not required to follow the 
credit bureau reporting requirements of that section;
    (B) Perform the functions of the lender during the repayment period 
of the loan, as required under Sec. 682.209;
    (C) If the borrower is delinquent in repaying the loan at the time 
the agency pays a claim thereon to the lender or becomes delinquent 
while the agency holds the loan, exercise due diligence in accordance 
with Sec. 682.411 in attempting to collect the loan from the borrower 
and any endorser or co-maker; and
    (D) After the date of default on the loan, if any, comply with 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section with respect to collection activities 
on the loan, with the date of default treated as the claim payment date 
for purposes of those paragraphs.
    (8) Preemption of State law. The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), 
(5), and (6) of this section preempt any State law, including State 
statutes, regulations, or rules, that would conflict with or hinder 
satisfaction of the requirements of these provisions.
    (9) Administrative Garnishment. (i) If a guaranty agency decides to 
garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not making payments on a 
loan held by the agency, on which the Secretary has paid a reinsurance 
claim, it shall do so in accordance with the following procedures:
    (A) The employer shall deduct and pay to the agency from a 
borrower's wages an amount that does not exceed the lesser of 10 percent 
of the borrower's disposable pay for each pay period or the amount 
permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, unless the borrower provides the agency 
with written consent to deduct a greater amount. For this purpose, the 
term ``disposable pay'' means that part of the borrower's compensation 
from an employer remaining after the deduction of any amounts required 
by law to be withheld.

[[Page 755]]

    (B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment 
proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's last known 
address, a written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, the 
intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt 
through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's 
rights.
    (C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to 
inspect and copy agency records related to the debt.
    (D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to 
enter into a written repayment agreement with the agency under terms 
agreeable to the agency.
    (E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity for 
a hearing in accordance with paragraph (b)(9)(i)(J) of this section 
concerning the existence or the amount of the debt and, in the case of a 
borrower whose proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order 
is established other than by a written agreement under paragraph 
(b)(9)(i)(D) of this section, the terms of the repayment schedule.
    (F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer for any amount that 
the employer, after receipt of the garnishment notice provided by the 
agency under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold 
from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's normal 
pay and disbursement cycle.
    (G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a borrower whom 
it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the 
borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months.
    (H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency 
believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, it 
shall send a withholding order to the employer within 20 days after the 
borrower fails to make a timely request for a hearing, or, if a timely 
request for a hearing is made by the borrower, within 20 days after a 
final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment.
    (I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(H) of 
this section must contain only the information as may be necessary for 
the employer to comply with the withholding order.
    (J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at the 
borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower submits a 
written request for a hearing on the existence or amount of the debt or 
the terms of the repayment schedule. The time and location of the 
hearing shall be established by the agency. An oral hearing may, at the 
borrower's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone 
conference. All telephonic charges must be the responsibility of the 
guaranty agency.
    (K) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty 
agency on or before the 15th day following the borrower's receipt of the 
notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty 
agency may not issue a withholding order until the borrower has been 
provided the requested hearing. For purposes of this paragraph, in the 
absence of evidence to the contrary, a borrower shall be considered to 
have received the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this 
section 5 days after it was mailed by the agency. The guaranty agency 
shall provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a 
decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may 
prescribe, to be rendered within 60 days.
    (L) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty 
agency after the 15th day following the borrower's receipt of the notice 
described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency 
shall provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time that a 
decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may 
prescribe, may be rendered within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of 
a withholding order unless the agency determines that the delay in 
filing the request was caused by factors over which the borrower had no 
control, or the agency receives information that the agency believes 
justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order. For purposes 
of this paragraph, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a 
borrower shall be considered to have

[[Page 756]]

received the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section 
5 days after it was mailed by the agency.
    (M) The hearing official appointed by the agency to conduct the 
hearing may be any qualified individual, including an administrative law 
judge, not under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty 
agency.
    (N) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision at the 
earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the guaranty 
agency's receipt of the borrower's hearing request.
    (O) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the HEA, the borrower may 
seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if the employer 
discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against the 
borrower due to the issuance of a withholding order.
    (ii) References to ``the borrower'' in this paragraph include all 
endorsers on a loan.
    (10) Conflicts of interest. (i) A guaranty agency shall maintain and 
enforce written standards of conduct governing the performance of its 
employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents engaged in the 
selection, award, and administration of contracts or agreements. The 
standards of conduct must, at a minimum, require disclosure of financial 
or other interests and must mandate disinterested decision-making. The 
standards must provide for appropriate disciplinary actions to be 
applied for violations of the standards by employees, officers, 
directors, trustees, or agents of the guaranty agency, and must include 
provisions to--
    (A) Prohibit any employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent from 
participating in the selection, award, or decision-making related to the 
administration of a contract or agreement supported by the reserve fund 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, if that participation would 
create a conflict of interest. Such a conflict would arise if the 
employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent, or any member of his or 
her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization that 
employs or is about to employ any of those parties has a financial or 
ownership interest in the organization selected for an award or would 
benefit from the decision made in the administration of the contract or 
agreement. The prohibitions described in this paragraph do not apply to 
employees of a State agency covered by codes of conduct established 
under State law;
    (B) Ensure sufficient separation of responsibility and authority 
between its lender claims processing as a guaranty agency and its 
lending or loan servicing activities, or both, within the guaranty 
agency or between that agency and one or more affiliates, including 
independence in direct reporting requirements and such management and 
systems controls as may be necessary to demonstrate, in the independent 
audit required under Sec. 682.410(b)(1), that claims filed by another 
arm of the guaranty agency or by an affiliate of that agency receive no 
more favorable treatment than that accorded the claims filed by a lender 
or servicer that is not an affiliate or part of the guaranty agency; and
    (C) Prohibit the employees, officers, directors, trustees, and 
agents of the guaranty agency, his or her partner, or any member of his 
or her immediate family, from soliciting or accepting gratuities, 
favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to 
agreements, except that nominal and unsolicited gratuities, favors, or 
items may be accepted.
    (ii) Guaranty agency restructuring. If the Secretary determines that 
action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest because of an 
agency's failure to meet the requirements of Sec. 682.410(b)(10)(i), the 
Secretary may require the agency to comply with any additional measures 
that the Secretary believes are appropriate, including the total 
divestiture of the agency's non-FFEL functions and the agency's 
interests in any affiliated organization.
    (c) Enforcement requirements. A guaranty agency shall take such 
measures and establish such controls as are necessary to ensure its 
vigorous enforcement of all Federal, State, and guaranty agency 
requirements, including agreements, applicable to its loan guarantee 
program, including, at a minimum, the following:
    (1) Conducting comprehensive biennial on-site program reviews, using 
statistically valid techniques to calculate liabilities to the Secretary 
that each

[[Page 757]]

review indicates may exist, of at least--
    (i)(A) Each participating lender whose dollar volume of FFEL loans 
made or held by the lender and guaranteed by the agency in the preceding 
year--
    (1) Equaled or exceeded two percent of the total of all loans 
guaranteed in that year by the agency;
    (2) Was one of the ten largest lenders whose loans were guaranteed 
in that year by the agency; or
    (3) Equaled or exceeded $10 million in the most recent fiscal year;
    (B) Each lender described in section 435(d)(1)(D) or (J) of the Act 
that is located in any State in which the agency is the principal 
guarantor as defined in Sec. 682.800(d), and, at the option of each 
guaranty agency, the Student Loan Marketing Association; and
    (C) Each participating school, located in a State for which the 
guaranty agency is the principal guaranty agency, that has a cohort 
default rate, as described in subpart M of 34 CFR part 668, for either 
of the 2 immediately preceding fiscal years, as defined in 34 CFR 
668.182, that exceeds 20 percent, unless the school is under a mandate 
from the Secretary under subpart M of 34 CFR part 668 to take specific 
default reduction measures or if the total dollar amount of loans 
entering repayment in each fiscal year on which the cohort default rate 
over 20 percent is based does not exceed $100,000; or
    (ii) The schools and lenders selected by the agency as an 
alternative to the reviews required by paragraphs (c)(1)(A)-(C) of this 
section if the Secretary approves the agency's proposed alternative 
selection methodology.
    (2) Demanding prompt repayment by the responsible parties to 
lenders, borrowers, the agency, or the Secretary, as appropriate, of all 
funds found in those reviews to be owed by the participants with regard 
to loans guaranteed by the agency, whether or not the agency holds the 
loans, and monitoring the implementation by participants of corrective 
actions, including these repayments, required by the agency as a result 
of those reviews.
    (3) Referring to the Secretary for further enforcement action any 
case in which repayment of funds to the Secretary is not made in full 
within 60 days of the date of the agency's written demand to the school,

regulations.
    (6) Promptly referring to appropriate State and local regulatory 
agencies and to nationally recognized accrediting agencies and 
associations for investigation information received by the guaranty 
agency that may affect the retention or renewal of the license or 
accreditation of a program participant.
    (7) Promptly reporting all of the allegations and indications of 
misconduct having a substantial basis in fact, and the scope, progress, 
and results of the agency's investigations thereof to the Secretary.
    (8) Referring appropriate cases to State or local authorities for 
criminal prosecution or civil litigation.
    (9) Promptly notifying the Secretary of--
    (i) Any action it takes affecting the FFEL program eligibility of a

<R05>
Sec. 682.411  Lender due diligence in collecting guaranty agency loans.

    (a) General. In the event of delinquency on an FFEL Program loan, 
the lender must engage in at least the collection efforts described in 
paragraphs (c) through (n) of this section, except that in the case of a 
loan made to a borrower who is incarcerated, residing outside a State, 
Mexico, or Canada, or whose telephone number is unknown, the lender may 
send a forceful collection letter instead of each telephone effort 
required by this section.
    (b) Delinquency. (1) For purposes of this section, delinquency on a 
loan begins on the first day after the due date of the first missed 
payment that is not later made. The due date of the first payment is 
established by the lender but must occur by the deadlines specified in 
Sec. 682.209(a) or, if the lender first learns after the fact that the 
borrower has entered the repayment period, no later than 75 days after 
the day the lender so learns, except as provided in 
Sec. 682.209(a)(2)(v) and (a)(3)(ii)(E). If a payment is made late, the 
first day of delinquency is the day after the due date of the next 
missed payment that is not later made. A payment that is within five 
dollars of the amount normally required to advance the due date may 
nevertheless advance the due date if the lender's procedures allow for 
that advancement.
    (2) At no point during the periods specified in paragraphs (c), (d), 
and (e) of this section may the lender permit the occurrence of a gap in 
collection activity, as defined in paragraph (j) of this section, of 
more than 45 days (60 days in the case of a transfer).
    (3) As part of one of the collection activities provided for in this 
section, the lender must provide the borrower with information on the 
availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.
    (c) 1-15 days delinquent. Except in the case in which a loan is 
brought into this period by a payment on the loan, expiration of an 
authorized deferment or forbearance period, or the lender's receipt from 
the drawee of a dishonored check submitted as a payment on the loan, the 
lender during this period must send at least one written notice or 
collection letter to the borrower informing the borrower of the 
delinquency and urging the borrower to make payments sufficient to 
eliminate the delinquency. The notice or collection letter sent during 
this period must include, at a minimum, a lender or servicer contact, a 
telephone number, and a prominent statement informing the borrower that 
assistance may be available if he or she is experiencing difficulty in 
making a scheduled repayment.

[[Page 759]]

    (d) 16-180 days delinquent (16-240 days delinquent for a loan 
repayable in installments less frequently than monthly). (1) Unless 
exempted under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, during this period the 
lender must engage in at least four diligent efforts to contact the 
borrower by telephone and send at least four collection letters urging 
the borrower to make the required payments on the loan. At least one of 
the diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone must occur on 
or before, and another one must occur after, the 90th day of 
delinquency. Collection letters sent during this period must include, at 
a minimum, information for the borrower regarding deferment, 
forbearance, income-sensitive repayment and loan consolidation, and 
other available options to avoid default.
    (2) At least two of the collection letters required under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section must warn the borrower that, if the loan is not 
paid, the lender will assign the loan to the guaranty agency that, in 
turn, will report the default to all national credit bureaus, and that 
the agency may institute proceedings to offset the borrower's State and 
Federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the Federal 
Government to the borrower or to garnish the borrower's wages, or to 
assign the loan to the Federal Government for litigation against the 
borrower.
    (3) Following the lender's receipt of a payment on the loan or a 
correct address for the borrower, the lender's receipt from the drawee 
of a dishonored check received as a payment on the loan, the lender's 
receipt of a correct telephone number for the borrower, or the 
expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period, the lender 
is required to engage in only--
    (i) Two diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone during 
this period, if the loan is less than 91 days delinquent (121 days 
delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than 
monthly) upon receipt of the payment, correct address, correct telephone 
number, or returned check, or expiration of the deferment or 
forbearance; or
    (ii) One diligent effort to contact the borrower by telephone during 
this period if the loan is 91-120 days delinquent (121-180 days 
delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than 
monthly) upon receipt of the payment, correct address, correct telephone 
number, or returned check, or expiration of the deferment or 
forbearance.
    (4) A lender need not attempt to contact by telephone any borrower 
who is more than 120 days delinquent (180 days delinquent for a loan 
repayable in installments less frequent than monthly) following the 
lender's receipt of--
    (i) A payment on the loan;
    (ii) A correct address or correct telephone number for the borrower;
    (iii) A dishonored check received from the drawee as a payment on 
the loan; or
    (iv) The expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance.
    (e) 181-270 days delinquent (241-330 days delinquent for a loan 
repayable in installments less frequently than monthly). During this 
period the lender must engage in efforts to urge the borrower to make 
the required payments on the loan. These efforts must, at a minimum, 
provide information to the borrower regarding options to avoid default 
and the consequences of defaulting on the loan.
    (f) Final demand. On or after the 241st day of delinquency (the 
301st day for loans payable in less frequent installments than monthly) 
the lender must send a final demand letter to the borrower requiring 
repayment of the loan in full and notifying the borrower that a default 
will be reported to a national credit bureau. The lender must allow the 
borrower at least 30 days after the date the letter is mailed to respond 
to the final demand letter and to bring the loan out of default before 
filing a default claim on the loan.
    (g) Collection procedures when borrower's telephone number is not 
available. Upon completion of a diligent but unsuccessful effort to 
ascertain the correct telephone number of a borrower as required by 
paragraph (m) of this section, the lender is excused from any further 
efforts to contact the borrower by telephone, unless the borrower's 
number is obtained before the 211th day of delinquency (the 271st day 
for loans repayable in installments less frequently than monthly).

[[Page 760]]

    (h) Skip-tracing. (1) Unless the letter specified under paragraph 
(f) of this section has already been sent, within 10 days of its receipt 
of information indicating that it does not know the borrower's current 
address, the lender must begin to diligently attempt to locate the 
borrower through the use of effective commercial skip-tracing 
techniques. These efforts must include, but are not limited to, sending 
a letter to or making a diligent effort to contact each endorser, 
relative, reference, individual, and entity, identified in the 
borrower's loan file, including the schools the student attended. For 
this purpose, a lender's contact with a school official who might 
reasonably be expected to know the borrower's address may be with 
someone other than the financial aid administrator, and may be in 
writing or by phone calls. These efforts must be completed by the date 
of default with no gap of more than 45 days between attempts to contact 
those individuals or entities.
    (2) Upon receipt of information indicating that it does not know the 
borrower's current address, the lender must discontinue the collection 
efforts described in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.
    (3) If the lender is unable to ascertain the borrower's current 
address despite its performance of the activities described in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section, the lender is excused thereafter from 
performance of the collection activities described in paragraphs (c) 
through (f) and (l)(1) through (l)(3) and (l)(5) of this section unless 
it receives communication indicating the borrower's address before the 
241st day of delinquency (the 301st day for loans payable in less 
frequent installments than monthly).
    (4) The activities specified by paragraph (m)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section (with references to the ``borrower'' understood to mean 
endorser, reference, relative, individual, or entity as appropriate) 
meet the requirement that the lender make a diligent effort to contact 
each individual identified in the borrower's loan file.
    (i) Default aversion assistance. Not earlier than the 60th day and 
no later than the 120th day of delinquency, a lender must request 
default aversion assistance from the guaranty agency that guarantees the 
loan.
    (j) Gap in collection activity. For purposes of this section, the 
term gap in collection activity means, with respect to a loan, any 
period--
    (1) Beginning on the date that is the day after--
    (i) The due date of a payment unless the lender does not know the 
borrower's address on that date;
    (ii) The day on which the lender receives a payment on a loan that 
remains delinquent notwithstanding the payment;
    (iii) The day on which the lender receives the correct address for a 
delinquent borrower;
    (iv) The day on which the lender completes a collection activity;
    (v) The day on which the lender receives a dishonored check 
submitted as a payment on the loan;
    (vi) The expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period 
on a delinquent loan; or
    (vii) The day the lender receives information indicating it does not 
know the borrower's current address; and
    (2) Ending on the date of the earliest of--
    (i) The day on which the lender receives the first subsequent 
payment or completed deferment request or forbearance agreement;
    (ii) The day on which the lender begins the first subsequent 
collection activity;
    (iii) The day on which the lender receives written communication 
from the borrower relating to his or her account; or
    (iv) Default.
    (k) Transfer. For purposes of this section, the term transfer with 
respect to a loan means any action, including, but not limited to, the 
sale of the loan, that results in a change in the system used to monitor 
or conduct collection activity on a loan from one system to another.
    (l) Collection activity. For purposes of this section, the term 
collection activity with respect to a loan means--
    (1) Mailing or otherwise transmitting to the borrower at an address 
that the lender reasonably believes to be the borrower's current address 
a collection

[[Page 761]]

letter or final demand letter that satisfies the timing and content 
requirements of paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section;
    (2) Making an attempt to contact the borrower by telephone to urge 
the borrower to begin or resume repayment;
    (3) Conducting skip-tracing efforts, in accordance with paragraph 
(h)(1) or (m)(1)(iii) of this section, to locate a borrower whose 
correct address or telephone number is unknown to the lender;
    (4) Mailing or otherwise transmitting to the guaranty agency a 
request for default aversion assistance available from the agency on the 
loan at the time the request is transmitted; or
    (5) Any telephone discussion or personal contact with the borrower 
so long as the borrower is apprised of the account's past-due status.
    (m) Diligent effort for telephone contact. (1) For purposes of this 
section, the term diligent effort with respect to telephone contact 
means--
    (i) A successful effort to contact the borrower by telephone;
    (ii) At least two unsuccessful attempts to contact the borrower by 
telephone at a number that the lender reasonably believes to be the 
borrower's correct telephone number; or
    (iii) An unsuccessful effort to ascertain the correct telephone 
number of a borrower, including, but not limited to, a directory 
assistance inquiry as to the borrower's telephone number, and sending a 
letter to or making a diligent effort to contact each reference, 
relative, and individual identified in the most recent loan application 
or most recent school certification for that borrower held by the 
lender. The lender may contact a school official other than the 
financial aid administrator who reasonably may be expected to know the 
borrower's address or telephone number.
    (2) If the lender is unable to ascertain the borrower's correct 
telephone number despite its performance of the activities described in 
paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section, the lender is excused thereafter 
from attempting to contact the borrower by telephone unless it receives 
a communication indicating the borrower's current telephone number 
before the 211th day of delinquency (the 271st day for loans repayable 
in installments less frequently than monthly).
    (3) The activities specified by paragraph (m)(1) (i) or (ii) of this 
section (with references to ``the borrower'' understood to mean 
endorser, reference, relative, or individual as appropriate), meet the 
requirement that the lender make a diligent effort to contact each 
endorser or each reference, relative, or individual identified on the 
borrower's most recent loan application or most recent school 
certification.
    (n) Due diligence for endorsers. (1) Before filing a default claim 
on a loan with an endorser, the lender must--
    (i) Make a diligent effort to contact the endorser by telephone; and
    (ii) Send the endorser on the loan two letters advising the endorser 
of the delinquent status of the loan and urging the endorser to make the 
required payments on the loan with at least one letter containing the 
information described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (with 
references to ``the borrower'' understood to mean the endorser).
    (2) On or after the 241st day of delinquency (the 301st day for 
loans payable in less frequent installments than monthly) the lender 
must send a final demand letter to the endorser requiring repayment of 
the loan in full and notifying the endorser that a default will be 
reported to a national credit bureau. The lender must allow the endorser 
at least 30 days after the date the letter is mailed to respond to the 
final demand letter and to bring the loan out of default before filing a 
default claim on the loan.
    (3) Unless the letter specified under paragraph (n)(2) of this 
section has already been sent, upon receipt of information indicating 
that it does not know the endorser's current address or telephone 
number, the lender must diligently attempt to locate the endorser 
through the use of effective commercial skip-tracing techniques. This 
effort must include an inquiry to directory assistance.
    (o) Preemption of State law. The provisions of this section preempt 
any State law, including State statutes, regulations, or rules, that 
would conflict with

[[Page 762]]

or hinder satisfaction of the requirements or frustrate the purposes of 
this section.

receives notice from the Secretary of the liability; or
    (C) The Secretary is unable to collect the liability from the lender 
by offsetting the lender's bill to the Secretary for interest benefits 
or special allowance, if--
    (1) The bill is submitted after the 30 day period specified in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section has passed; and
    (2) The lender has not paid, or made satisfactory arrangements to 
pay, the liability.
    (b)(1) The Secretary requires a guaranty agency to repay reinsurance

Sec. 682.406(a).
    (2) The Secretary may require a guaranty agency to repay reinsurance 
payments received on a loan or to assign FFEL loans to the Department if 
the agency fails to meet the requirements of Sec. 682.410.
    (c)(1) In addition to requiring repayment of reinsurance payments 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may take one or 
more of the following remedial actions against a guaranty agency or 
third-party servicer administering any aspect of the FFEL programs under 
a contract with the guaranty agency, that makes an incomplete or

this part or violates any applicable Federal requirement:
    (i) Require the agency to return payments made by the Secretary to 
the agency.

failed to make the appropriate corrections to the system.
    (vi) Require repayment from the agency and servicer pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, of interest, special allowance, and 
reinsurance paid on Consolidation loan amounts attributed to 
Consolidation loans for which the certification required under 
Sec. 682.206(f)(1) is not available.
    (vii) Require repayment from the agency or servicer, pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, of any related payments that the 
Secretary became obligated to make to others as a result of an 
incomplete or incorrect statement or a violation of an applicable 
Federal requirement.

Sec. 682.413(c)(1)(vi) as a result of a violation by the servicer 
administering any aspect of the FFEL programs under a contract with that 
guaranty agency.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the relevant 
third-party servicer shall repay any outstanding liabilities under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section only if--
    (i) The Secretary has determined that the servicer is jointly and

    (2) The guaranty agency has not paid, or made satisfactory 
arrangements to pay, the liability.
    (d)(1) The Secretary follows the procedures described in 34 CFR part 
668, subpart G, applicable to fine proceedings against schools, in 
imposing a fine against a lender, guaranty agency, or third-party 
servicer. References to ``the institution'' in those regulations shall 
be understood to mean the lender, guaranty agency, or third-party 
servicer, as applicable, for this purpose.
    (2) The Secretary also follows the provisions of section 432(g) of 
the Act in imposing a fine against a guaranty agency or lender.
    (e)(1)(i) The Secretary's decision to require repayment of funds, 
withhold funds, or to limit or suspend a lender, guaranty agency, or 
third party servicer from participation in the FFEL Program or to 
terminate a lender or third party from participation in the FFEL Program 
does not become final until the Secretary provides the lender, agency, 
or servicer with written notice of the intended action and an 
opportunity to be heard. The hearing is at a time and in a manner the 
Secretary determines to be appropriate to the resolution of the issues 
on which the lender, agency, or servicer requests the hearing.
    (ii) The Secretary's decision to terminate a guaranty agency's 
participation in the FFEL Program after September 24, 1998 does not 
become final until the Secretary provides the agency with written notice 
of the intended action and provides an opportunity for a hearing on the 
record.
    (2)(i) The Secretary may withhold payments from an agency or suspend 
an agreement with an agency prior to giving notice and an opportunity to 
be heard if the Secretary finds that emergency action is necessary to 
prevent substantial harm to Federal interests.
    (ii) The Secretary follows the notice and show cause procedures 
described in Sec. 682.704 applicable to emergency actions against 
lenders in taking an emergency action against a guaranty agency.
    (3) The Secretary follows the procedures in 34 CFR 30.20-30.32 in 
collecting a debt by offset against payments otherwise due a guaranty 
agency or lender.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)-(e) of this section, the 
Secretary may waive the right to require repayment of funds by a lender 
or agency if in the Secretary's judgment the best interests of the 
United States so require. The Secretary's waiver policy for violations 
of Sec. 682.406(a)(3) or (a)(5) is set forth in appendix D to this part.
    (g) The Secretary's final decision to require repayment of funds or 
to take other remedial action, other than a fine, against a lender or 
guaranty agency under this section is conclusive and binding on the 
lender or agency.
    Note: A decision by the Secretary under this section is subject to 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 706 and 41 U.S.C. 321-322.

Sec. 682.415  Special insurance and reinsurance rules.

    (a)(1) A lender or lender servicer (as an agent for an eligible 
lender) designated for exceptional performance under paragraph (b) of 
this section shall receive 100 percent reimbursement on all claims 
submitted for insurance during the 12-month period following the date 
the lender or lender servicer and appropriate guaranty agencies receive 
notification of the designation of the eligible lender or lender 
servicer under paragraph (b) of this section. A guaranty agency or a 
guaranty agency servicer (as an agent for a guaranty agency) designated 
for exceptional performance under paragraph (c) of this section shall 
receive the applicable reinsurance rate under section 428(c)(1) of the 
Act on all claims submitted for payments by the guaranty agency or 
guaranty agency servicer during the 12-month period following the date 
the guaranty agency receives notification of its designation, or its 
servicer's designation, under paragraph (c) of this section. A notice of 
designation for exceptional performance under this section is deemed to 
have been received by the lender, servicer, or guaranty agency no later 
than 3 days after the date the notice is mailed, unless the lender, 
servicer, or guaranty agency is able to prove otherwise.
    (2) To receive a designation for exceptional performance under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a lender, servicer, and guaranty 
agency must submit to the Secretary--
    (i) A written request for designation for exceptional performance 
that includes--
    (A) The applicant's name and address;
    (B) A contact person;
    (C) Its ED identification number, if applicable;
    (D) The name and address of applicable guarantors; and
    (E) A copy of an annual financial audit performed in accordance with 
the Audit Guide developed by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of 
Inspector General, or one of the following as appropriate:
    (1) A lender may submit a copy of an annual audit required under 
Sec. 682.305(c), if the audit period ends no more than 90 days prior to 
the date the lender submits its request for designation.
    (2) A servicer may submit a copy of the annual financial audit, as 
defined, completed and submitted under 34 CFR 682.416(e), if the audit 
period ends no more than 90 days prior to the date the servicer submits 
its request for designation.
    (3) A guaranty agency may submit a copy of the annual audit required 
under section 428(b)(2)(D) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
amended, if the audit period ends no more than 90 days prior to the date 
the guaranty agency submits its request for designation;
    (ii) If the applicant is a servicer, a statement signed by the owner 
or chief executive officer of the applicant certifying that the 
applicant meets the definition of a servicer contained in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section; and
    (iii)(A) A compliance audit of its loan portfolio, conducted by a 
qualified independent organization meeting the criteria in paragraph 
(b)(9) of this section, that yields a compliance performance rating of 
97 percent or higher of all due diligence requirements applicable to 
each loan, on average, with respect to the collection of delinquent or 
defaulted loans and satisfying the requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) 
of this section or, if applicable, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. 
The audit period may end no more than 90 days prior to the date the 
lender, servicer or guaranty agency submits its request for designation.
    (B) To satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section,

[[Page 768]]

a servicer may submit its annual compliance audit under 34 CFR 
682.416(e), if the servicer includes in its report a measure of its 
compliance performance rating required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of 
this section, if this audit is performed in accordance with an audit 
guide developed by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector 
General.
    (3) The cost of audits for determining eligibility and continued 
compliance under this section is the responsibility of the lender, 
servicer, or guaranty agency.
    (4) A lender or servicer shall also submit the information in 
paragraph (a)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section to each appropriate 
guaranty agency.
    (5) A lender may be designated for exceptional performance for loans 
that it services itself. A lender servicer may be designated for 
exceptional performance only for all loans it services.
    (6)(i) To prevent a lapse of a lender's, servicer's, or guaranty 
agency's exceptional performance status after the end of the 12-month 
period, the lender, servicer, or guaranty agency shall submit updated 
information required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the 
Secretary no later than 90 days after the end of the annual audit 
period.
    (ii) Upon the Secretary's determination that the lender, servicer, 
or guaranty agency maintained at least a 97 percent compliance 
performance rate and satisfies the other requirements for designation, 
the Secretary notifies the lender, servicer, or guaranty agency that its 
redesignation for exceptional performance begins on the date following 
the last day of the previous 12-month period for which it received 
designation for exceptional performance. However, a lender's, 
servicer's, or guaranty agency's designation for exceptional performance 
continues until it receives notification from the Secretary that its 
request for redesignation is approved, or that its designation is 
revoked, under the provisions of paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) The Secretary notifies the lender or lender servicer and the 
appropriate guaranty agency within 60 days after the date the Secretary 
receives the information, listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
from the eligible lender or lender servicer, that the lender's or lender 
servicer's reapplication for designation for exceptional performance has 
been approved or denied. A notice under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this 
section is determined to have been received by the lender, servicer, or 
guaranty agency no later than 3 days after the notice is mailed, unless 
the lender, servicer, or guaranty agency is able to prove otherwise.
    (b) Determination of eligibility. (1) The Secretary determines 
whether to designate a lender or lender servicer for exceptional 
performance based upon--
    (i) The annual compliance audit of collection activities required 
for FFEL Program loans under Sec. 682.411(c) through (h), and (m), if 
applicable, serviced during the audit period;
    (ii) Information from any guaranty agency regarding an eligible 
lender or lender servicer desiring designation, including, but not 
limited to, any information suggesting that the lender's or lender 
servicer's request for designation should not be approved;
    (iii) Any other information in the possession of the Secretary, or 
submitted to the Secretary by any other agency or office of the Federal 
Government; and
    (iv) Evidence indicating that the lender or lender servicer has 
complied with the requirements for converting FFEL Program loans to 
repayment under Sec. 682.209(a), and the timely filing requirements 
under Secs. 682.402(g)(2) and 682.406(a)(5), in accordance with the 
audit guide as published by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of 
Inspector General. The audit submitted under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section may satisfy this requirement, if a separate sample of loans is 
used.
    (2) The Secretary informs the eligible lender or lender servicer, 
and the appropriate guaranty agency, that the lender's or lender 
servicer's request for designation as an exceptional lender or lender 
servicer has been approved, unless the results of the audit are 
persuasively rebutted by information under paragraphs (b) (1)(ii) or 
(iii) of this section. If the request for designation is not approved, 
the Secretary informs the lender or lender servicer and the

[[Page 769]]

appropriate guaranty agency or agencies of the reason the application is 
not approved.
    (3) In calculating a lender's or lender servicer's compliance 
rating, as referenced in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the 
universe for the audit must include all loans in the lender's or lender 
servicer's FFEL Program portfolio that are serviced during the audit 
period performed under the Department's regulations in Secs. 682.411, 
682.209(a), 682.402(g)(2), and 682.406(a)(5). The calculation may 
consider only due diligence activities applicable to the audit period. 
The numerator must include the total number of collection activities 
successfully completed, in accordance with program regulations, that are 
serviced during the audit period. The denominator must include the total 
number of collection activities required to be performed, in compliance 
with program regulations, that are serviced during the audit period. 
Using statistical sampling and evaluation techniques identified in an 
audit guide prepared by the Department's Office of Inspector General, a 
random sample of loans must be selected and evaluated.
    (4) The Secretary notifies the lender or lender servicer and the 
appropriate guaranty agency within 60 days after the date the Secretary 
receives the information, listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
from the eligible lender or lender servicer, that the lender's or lender 
servicer's application for designation for exceptional performance has 
been approved or denied.
    (5)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a 
guaranty agency may not refuse, solely on the basis of a violation of 
repayment conversion, due diligence requirements, or timely filing 
requirements, to pay an eligible lender or lender servicer, designated 
for exceptional performance, 100 percent of the unpaid principal and 
interest of all loans for which eligible claims are submitted for 
insurance payment by that eligible lender or lender servicer. The 
designation of a lender or lender servicer for exceptional performance 
applies to loans that have been serviced by the lender or lender 
servicer for the last 180 days prior to a borrower's default or earlier 
in the case of death, disability, bankruptcy, or closed school and false 
certification discharges.
    (ii) A guaranty agency or the Secretary may require the lender or 
lender servicer to repurchase a loan if the agency determines the loan 
should not have been submitted as a claim. A guaranty agency may not 
require repurchase of a loan based solely on the lender's violation of 
the requirement relating to repayment conversion, due diligence, or 
timely filing. The guaranty agency must pay claims to a lender or lender 
servicer designated for exceptional performance in accordance with this 
paragraph for the one-year period following the date the guaranty agency 
receives notification of the lender's or lender servicer's designation 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary notifies 
the guaranty agency that the lender's or lender servicer's designation 
for exceptional performance has been revoked.
    (6)(i) To maintain its designation for exceptional performance, the 
lender or lender servicer must have a quarterly compliance audit of the 
due diligence in collection activities required for FFEL Program loans 
under Sec. 682.411(c)-(h), and (m), if applicable, and for converting 
FFEL Program loans to repayment under Sec. 682.209(a) and timely filing 
requirements under Secs. 682.402(g)(2) and 682.406(a)(5) conducted by a 
qualified independent organization meeting the criteria in paragraph 
(b)(9) of this section that results in a compliance rating for the 
quarter of not less than 97 percent. The audit must indicate a 
compliance performance rating of not less than 97 percent for two 
consecutive months or 90 percent for any month. The quarterly audit may 
not include any period covered by the annual financial and compliance 
audit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The results of the 
quarterly compliance audit must be submitted to the Secretary and to the 
appropriate guaranty agencies within 90 days following the end of each 
quarter.
    (ii) If a lender or lender servicer has been designated for 
exceptional performance for at least 15 months, a lender or lender 
servicer may petition the Secretary for permission to have its internal 
auditors perform the subsequent

[[Page 770]]

quarterly compliance audits required by paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section. If the Secretary approves the request, the lender's or lender 
servicer's annual audit must assess the reliability of the procedures 
used by the lender's or lender servicer's internal auditor in performing 
the quarterly audits.
    (iii) The lender or lender servicer shall perform three quarterly 
audits and one annual audit that includes a representative sample of 
fourth quarter collection activities to satisfy the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (7)(i) Insurance payments made on eligible claims submitted by a 
lender or lender servicer designated for exceptional performance are not 
subject to additional review of repayment conversion, due diligence, and 
timely filing requirements, or to required repurchase by the lender or 
lender servicer, unless the Secretary determines that the eligible 
lender or lender servicer engaged in fraud or other purposeful 
misconduct in obtaining designation for exceptional performance. 
Notwithstanding the payment requirements in this paragraph, nothing 
prohibits the guaranty agency or the Secretary from reviewing the 
lender's or lender servicer's activities in regard to the loans paid 
under this paragraph as part of program oversight responsibilities, or 
for requiring the lender to repurchase a loan if the agency determines 
the loan should not have been submitted as a claim. The lender shall 
file, and the guaranty agency shall maintain, the documentation the 
guaranty agency normally requires its lenders to file with respect to 
the collection history of each loan.
    (ii) A lender or lender servicer designated under this section that 
fails to service loans or otherwise comply with applicable program 
regulations is considered in violation of 31 U.S.C. 3729.
    (8)(i) The Secretary revokes the designation of a lender or lender 
servicer for exceptional performance if--
    (A) The quarterly compliance audit required under paragraph (b)(6) 
of this section is submitted to the Secretary and indicates that the 
lender or lender servicer failed to maintain not less than 97 percent 
compliance with due diligence standards for the quarter, or not less 
than 97 percent compliance for 2 consecutive months, or 90 percent for 
any month; or
    (B) Any quarterly audit required in paragraph (b)(6) of this section 
is not received by the Secretary within 90 days following the end of 
each quarter.
    (ii) The Secretary may revoke the designation of an exceptional 
lender or lender servicer if--
    (A) The Secretary determines the eligible lender or lender servicer 
failed to maintain an overall level of regulatory compliance consistent 
with the audit submitted by the lender or lender servicer;
    (B) The Secretary has reason to believe the lender or lender 
servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing its designation for 
exceptional performance; or
    (C) The lender or lender servicer fails to service loans in 
accordance with program regulations. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
lender or lender servicer fails to service loans in accordance with 
program regulations if the Secretary determines that the lender or 
lender servicer has committed serious and material violations of the 
regulations.
    (iii) The date on which the event or condition occurred is the 
effective date of the revocation, except for revocation under paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section, which is effective at the close of the 12-month 
period for which the lender or lender servicer received designation for 
exceptional performance.
    (9) Public accountants, public accounting firms, and external 
government audit organizations that meet the qualification and 
independence standards contained in Government Auditing Standards 
published by the Comptroller General of the United States are acceptable 
entities to perform the audits required under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) 
and (b)(6) of this section.
    (c)(1)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, 
the Secretary pays the applicable reinsurance rate under section 
428(b)(1)(G) of the Act on all claims submitted by a guaranty agency or 
guaranty agency servicer that has been designated for exceptional 
performance.

[[Page 771]]

    (ii) A guaranty agency may be designated for exceptional performance 
for loans that it services itself.
    (iii) A guaranty agency servicer may be designated for exceptional 
performance for loans it services.
    (iv) A guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer is designated for 
exceptional performance for a 12-month period following the receipt, by 
the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer, of the Secretary's 
notification of designation.
    (v) A notice under this paragraph is determined to have been 
received no later than 3 days after the date the notice is mailed, 
unless the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer is able to prove 
otherwise.
    (2) The Secretary determines whether to designate a guaranty agency 
or guaranty agency servicer for exceptional performance based upon--
    (i) The annual financial audit and a compliance audit of collection 
activities, including timely claim payment and timely reinsurance filing 
required for FFEL Program loans under Secs. 682.410(b)(6)(i) through 
(xii), and 682.406 (a)(8) and (a)(9); and
    (ii) Any other information in the possession of the Secretary.
    (3) The Secretary informs the guaranty agency or guaranty agency 
servicer that its request for designation for exceptional performance 
has been approved, unless the results of the audit are persuasively 
rebutted by other information received by the Secretary. If the 
Secretary does not approve the guaranty agency's or guaranty agency 
servicer's request for designation, the Secretary informs the guaranty 
agency or guaranty agency servicer of the reason the application was not 
approved.
    (4) In calculating a guaranty agency's or guaranty agency servicer's 
compliance rating, as referenced in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this 
section, the Secretary requires that the universe of loans in the audit 
sample must consist of all loans in the guaranty agency's or guaranty 
agency servicer's FFEL Program portfolio that are serviced during the 
audit period performed under the Department's regulations in 
Secs. 682.410(b)(6)(i) through (xii) and 682.406 (a)(8) and (a)(9). The 
calculation may consider only the due diligence activities that were or 
should have been conducted during the audit period. The numerator must 
include the total number of collection activities successfully completed 
in accordance with program regulations on loans that were serviced 
during the audit period. The denominator must include the total number 
of collection activities required to be performed in compliance with 
program regulations on loans that were serviced during the audit period. 
Using statistical sampling and evaluation techniques identified in an 
audit guide prepared by the Department's Office of Inspector General, a 
random sample of loans must be selected and evaluated.
    (5) The Secretary notifies a guaranty agency or guaranty agency 
servicer, within 60 days after the date the Secretary receives the 
information listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section whether the 
guaranty agency's or guaranty agency servicer's application for 
designation for exceptional performance has been approved or denied.
    (6)(i) To maintain its status as an exceptional guaranty agency or 
guaranty agency servicer, the guaranty agency or guaranty agency 
servicer must have a quarterly compliance audit of the due diligence in 
collection activities of defaulted FFEL Program loans under 
Secs. 682.410(b)(6)(i) through (xii) and 682.406(a)(8) and (a)(9) 
conducted by a qualified independent organization meeting the criteria 
in paragraph (c)(9) of this section. The audit must yield a compliance 
performance rating of not less than 97 percent. The quarterly audit may 
not include any period covered by the annual financial and compliance 
audit required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The results of 
the quarterly compliance audit must be submitted to the Secretary within 
90 days following the end of each quarter.
    (ii) If the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer has been 
designated for exceptional performance for at least 15 months, the 
guaranty agency or a guaranty agency servicer may petition the Secretary 
for permission to have its internal auditors perform subsequent 
quarterly compliance audits required by paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this 
section. If the Secretary approves the request, the guaranty agency's or

[[Page 772]]

guaranty agency servicer's annual audit must assess the reliability of 
the procedures used by the guaranty agency's or the guaranty agency 
servicer's internal auditor in performing the quarterly audits.
    (7)(i) Payments of reinsurance made on claims, under the FFEL 
Program, submitted by a guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer 
designated for exceptional performance are not subject to repayment 
based on additional review of due diligence activities, including timely 
claim payment, or timely filing for reinsurance covering a period during 
which the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer was designated for 
any reason other than a determination by the Secretary that the eligible 
guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer engaged in fraud or other 
purposeful misconduct in obtaining designation for exceptional 
performance.
    (ii) A guaranty agency designated under this section that fails to 
service loans or otherwise comply with applicable program regulations is 
considered in violation of 31 U.S.C. 3729.
    (8)(i) The Secretary may revoke the designation of a guaranty agency 
or guaranty agency servicer for exceptional performance if the Secretary 
has reason to believe the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer 
fraudulently obtained its designation for exceptional performance.
    (ii) The Secretary may revoke the designation for exceptional 
performance upon 30 days' notice, and an opportunity for a hearing 
before the Secretary, if the Secretary finds that the guaranty agency or 
guaranty agency servicer failed to maintain an acceptable overall level 
of regulatory compliance.
    (9) A qualified independent organization is an organization that 
meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Due diligence requirements means the activities required to be 
performed by lenders or guaranty agencies on delinquent or defaulted 
loans pursuant to Sec. 682.411 (c) through (h), and (m), if applicable 
and Secs. 682.410(b)(6)(i) through (xii) and 682.406(a)(8) and (a)(9);
    (2) Eligible loan means a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under 
part B of title IV of the Act; and

    (i) Has substantial experience in servicing and collecting consumer 
loans or student loans;
    (ii) Has an annual independent financial audit that is furnished to 
the Secretary and any other parties designated by the Secretary;
    (iii) Has business systems capable of meeting the requirements of

Sec. 682.416  Requirements for third-party servicers and lenders contracting with third-party servicers.

    (a) Standards for administrative capability. A third-party servicer

third-party

[[Page 773]]

servicer is financially responsible under this part. References to ``the

    (2) In response to a request from the Secretary, the servicer shall 
provide evidence to demonstrate that it meets the administrative 
capability and financial responsibility standards in this section.
    (3) The servicer may also provide evidence of why administrative 
action is unwarranted if it is unable to demonstrate that it meets the 
standards of this section.
    (4) Based on the review of the materials provided by the servicer, 
the Secretary determines if the servicer meets the standards in this 
part. If the servicer does not, the Secretary may initiate an 
administrative proceeding under subpart G.
    (d) Past performance of third-party servicer or persons affiliated 
with servicer. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
third-party servicer is not financially responsible if--

executive officer; any person employed by the servicer in a capacity 
that involves the administration of a Title IV, HEA program or the 
receipt of Title IV, HEA program funds; any person, entity, or officer 
or employee of an entity with which the servicer contracts where that 
person, entity, or officer or employee of the entity acts in a capacity 
that involves the administration of a Title IV, HEA program or the 
receipt of Title IV, HEA program funds has been convicted of, or has 
pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, 
use, or expenditure of Federal, State, or local government funds, or has 
been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud 
or any other material violation of law involving such funds, unless--
    (A) The funds that were fraudulently obtained, or criminally 
acquired, used, or expended have been repaid to the United States, and 
any related financial penalty has been paid;
    (B) The persons who were convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or 
guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of the

conviction, nolo contendere plea, guilty plea, or administrative or 
judicial determination; or
    (ii) The servicer, or any principal or affiliate of the servicer (as

    (A) Debarred or suspended under Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 (3 CFR, 
1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (B) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 34 CFR 85.305 or 
85.405 for debarment or suspension under E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., 
p. 189) or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; and
    (2) Upon learning of a conviction, plea, or administrative or 
judicial determination described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
the servicer does not promptly remove the person, agency, or 
organization from any involvement in the administration of the 
servicer's participation in Title IV, HEA programs, including, as 
applicable, the removal or elimination of any substantial control, as 
determined under 34 CFR 668.15, over the servicer.
    (e) Independent audits. (1) A third-party servicer shall arrange for 
an independent audit of its administration of the FFELP loan portfolio 
unless--
    (i) The servicer contracts with only one lender or guaranty agency; 
and
    (ii) The audit of that lender's or guaranty agency's FFEL programs 
involves every aspect of the servicer's administration of those FFEL 
programs.
    (2) The audit must--
    (i) Examine the servicer's compliance with the Act and applicable 
regulations;
    (ii) Examine the servicer's financial management of its FFEL program

Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC 20402.) Procedures for audits are contained in an audit 
guide developed by and available from the Office of Inspector General of 
the Department of Education; and
    (iv) Except for the initial audit, be conducted at least annually 
and be submitted to the Secretary within six months of the end of the 
audit period. The initial audit must be an annual audit of the 
servicer's first full fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 1994, 
and include any period from the beginning of the first full fiscal year. 
The audit report must be submitted to the Secretary within six months of 
the end of the audit period. Each subsequent audit must cover the 
servicer's activities for the one-year period beginning no later than 
the end of the period covered by the preceding audit.
    (3) With regard to a third-party servicer that is a governmental 
entity, the audit required by this paragraph must be conducted in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G.
    (4) With regard to a third-party servicer that is a nonprofit

``Audit of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit 
Institutions,'' as incorporated in 34 CFR 74.61(h)(3).
    (f) Contract responsibilities. A lender that participates in the 
FFEL programs may not enter into a contract with a third-party servicer 
that the Secretary has determined does not meet the requirements of this 
section. The lender must provide the Secretary with the name and address 
of any third-party servicer with which the lender enters into a contract 
and, upon request by the Secretary, a copy of that contract. A third-
party servicer that is under contract with a lender to perform any 
activity for which the records in Sec. 682.414(a)(4)(ii) are relevant to 
perform the services for which the servicer has contracted shall 
maintain current, complete, and accurate records pertaining to each loan 
that the servicer is under contract to administer on behalf of the 
lender. The records must be maintained in a system that allows ready 
identification of each loan's current status.

Sec. 682.417  Determination of Federal funds or assets to be returned.

    (a) General. The procedures described in this section apply to a 
determination by the Secretary that--
    (1) A guaranty agency must return to the Secretary a portion of its 
Federal Fund that the Secretary has determined is unnecessary to pay the 
program expenses and contingent liabilities of the agency; and
    (2) A guaranty agency must require the return to the agency or the 
Secretary of Federal funds or assets within the meaning of section 
422(g)(1) of the Act held by or under the control of any other entity 
that the Secretary determines are necessary to pay the program expenses 
and contingent liabilities of the agency or that are required for the 
orderly termination of the guaranty agency's operations and the 
liquidation of its assets.
    (b) Return of unnecessary Federal funds. (1) The Secretary may 
initiate a process to recover unnecessary Federal funds under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that a guaranty 
agency's Federal Fund ratio under Sec. 682.410(a)(10) for each of the 
two preceding Federal fiscal years exceeded 2.0 percent.
    (2) If the Secretary initiates a process to recover unnecessary 
Federal funds, the Secretary requires the return of a portion of the 
Federal funds that the Secretary determines will permit the agency to--
    (i) Have a Federal Fund ratio of at least 2.0 percent under 
Sec. 682.410(a)(10) at the time of the determination; and
    (ii) Meet the minimum Federal Fund requirements under 
Sec. 682.410(a)(10) and retain sufficient additional Federal funds to 
perform its responsibilities as

[[Page 775]]

a guaranty agency during the current Federal fiscal year and the four 
succeeding Federal fiscal years.
    (3)(i) The Secretary makes a determination of the amount of Federal 
funds needed by the guaranty agency under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section on the basis of financial projections for the period described 
in that paragraph. If the agency provides projections for a period 
longer than the period referred to in that paragraph, the Secretary may 
consider those projections.
    (ii) The Secretary may require a guaranty agency to provide 
financial projections in a form and on the basis of assumptions 
prescribed by the Secretary. If the Secretary requests the agency to 
provide financial projections, the agency must provide the projections 
within 60 days of the Secretary's request. If the agency does not 
provide the projections within the specified time period, the Secretary 
determines the amount of Federal funds needed by the agency on the basis 
of other information.
    (c) Notice. (1) The Secretary or an authorized Departmental official 
begins a proceeding to order a guaranty agency to return a portion of 
its Federal funds, or to direct the return of Federal funds or assets 
subject to return, by sending the guaranty agency a notice by certified 
mail, return receipt requested.
    (2) The notice--
    (i) Informs the guaranty agency of the Secretary's determination 
that Federal funds or assets must be returned;
    (ii) Describes the basis for the Secretary's determination and 
contains sufficient information to allow the guaranty agency to prepare 
and present an appeal;
    (iii) States the date by which the return of Federal funds or assets 
must be completed;
    (iv) Describes the process for appealing the determination, 
including the time for filing an appeal and the procedure for doing so; 
and
    (v) Identifies any actions that the guaranty agency must take to 
ensure that the Federal funds or assets that are the subject of the 
notice are maintained and protected against use, expenditure, transfer, 
or other disbursement after the date of the Secretary's determination, 
and the basis for requiring those actions. The actions may include, but 
are not limited to, directing the agency to place the Federal funds in 
an escrow account. If the Secretary has directed the guaranty agency to 
require the return of Federal funds or assets held by or under the 
control of another entity, the guaranty agency must ensure that the 
agency's claims to those funds or assets and the collectability of the 
agency's claims will not be compromised or jeopardized during an appeal. 
The guaranty agency must also comply with all other applicable 
regulations relating to the use of Federal funds and assets.
    (d) Appeal. (1) A guaranty agency may appeal the Secretary's 
determination that Federal funds or assets must be returned by filing a 
written notice of appeal within 20 days of the date of the guaranty 
agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's determination. If the 
agency files a notice of appeal, the requirement that the return of 
Federal funds or assets be completed by a particular date is suspended 
pending completion of the appeal process. If the agency does not file a 
notice of appeal within the period specified in this paragraph, the 
Secretary's determination is final.
    (2) A guaranty agency must submit the information described in 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section within 45 days of the date of the 
guaranty agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's determination 
unless the Secretary agrees to extend the period at the agency's 
request. If the agency does not submit that information within the 
prescribed period, the Secretary's determination is final.
    (3) A guaranty agency's appeal of a determination that Federal funds 
or assets must be returned is considered and decided by a Departmental 
official other than the official who issued the determination or a 
subordinate of that official.
    (4) In an appeal of the Secretary's determination, the guaranty 
agency must--
    (i) State the reasons the guaranty agency believes the Federal funds 
or assets need not be returned;
    (ii) Identify any evidence on which the guaranty agency bases its 
position

[[Page 776]]

that Federal funds or assets need not be returned;
    (iii) Include copies of the documents that contain this evidence;
    (iv) Include any arguments that the guaranty agency believes support 
its position that Federal funds or assets need not be returned; and
    (v) Identify the steps taken by the guaranty agency to comply with 
the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.
    (5)(i) In its appeal, the guaranty agency may request the 
opportunity to make an oral argument to the deciding official for the 
purpose of clarifying any issues raised by the appeal. The deciding 
official provides this opportunity promptly after the expiration of the 
period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) The agency may not submit new evidence at or after the oral 
argument unless the deciding official determines otherwise. A transcript 
of the oral argument is made a part of the record of the appeal and is 
promptly provided to the agency.
    (6) The guaranty agency has the burden of production and the burden 
of persuading the deciding official that the Secretary's determination 
should be modified or withdrawn.
    (e) Third-party participation. (1) If the Secretary issues a 
determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary 
promptly publishes a notice in the Federal Register announcing the 
portion of the Federal Fund to be returned by the agency and providing 
interested persons an opportunity to submit written information relating 
to the determination within 30 days after the date of publication. The 
Secretary publishes the notice no earlier than five days after the 
agency receives a copy of the determination.
    (2) If the guaranty agency to which the determination relates files 
a notice of appeal of the determination, the deciding official may 
consider any information submitted in response to the Federal Register 
notice. All information submitted by a third party is available for 
inspection and copying at the offices of the Department of Education in 
Washington, D.C., during normal business hours.
    (f) Adverse information. If the deciding official considers 
information in addition to the evidence described in the notice of the 
Secretary's determination that is adverse to the guaranty agency's 
position on appeal, the deciding official informs the agency and 
provides it a reasonable opportunity to respond to the information 
without regard to the period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (g) Decision. (1) The deciding official issues a written decision on 
the guaranty agency's appeal within 45 days of the date on which the 
information described in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this 
section is received, or the oral argument referred to in paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section is held, whichever is later. The deciding 
official mails the decision to the guaranty agency by certified mail, 
return receipt requested. The decision of the deciding official becomes 
the final decision of the Secretary 30 days after the deciding official 
issues it. In the case of a determination that a guaranty agency must 
return Federal funds, if the deciding official does not issue a decision 
within the prescribed period, the agency is no longer required to take 
the actions described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.
    (2) A guaranty agency may not seek judicial review of the 
Secretary's determination to require the return of Federal funds or 
assets until the deciding official issues a decision.
    (3) The deciding official's written decision includes the basis for 
the decision. The deciding official bases the decision only on evidence 
described in the notice of the Secretary's determination and on 
information properly submitted and considered by the deciding official 
under this section. The deciding official is bound by all applicable 
statutes and regulations and may neither waive them nor rule them 
invalid.
    (h) Collection of Federal funds or assets. (1) If the deciding 
official's final decision requires the guaranty agency to return Federal 
funds, or requires the guaranty agency to require the return of Federal 
funds or assets to the agency or to the Secretary, the decision states a 
new date for compliance with the decision. The new date is no earlier

[[Page 777]]

than the date on which the decision becomes the final decision of the 
Secretary.
    (2) If the guaranty agency fails to comply with the decision, the 
Secretary may recover the Federal funds from any funds due the agency 
from the Department without any further notice or procedure and may take 
any other action permitted or authorized by law to compel compliance.

Sec. 682.418  Prohibited uses of the assets of the Operating Fund during periods in which the Operating Fund contains transferred funds owed to the Federal 
          Fund.

    (a) General. (1) During periods in which the Operating Fund contains 
transferred funds owed to the Federal Fund, a guaranty agency may not 
use the assets of the Operating Fund to pay costs prohibited under 
paragraph (b) of this section and may not use the assets of the 
Operating Fund to pay for goods, property, or services provided by an 
affiliated organization unless the agency applies and demonstrates to 
the Secretary, and receives the Secretary's approval, that the payment 
would be in the Federal fiscal interest and would not exceed the 
affiliated organization's actual and reasonable cost of providing those 
goods, property, or services.
    (2) All guaranty agency contracts with respect to its Operating Fund 
or assets must include a provision stating that the contract is 
terminable by the Secretary upon 30 days notice to the contracting 
parties if the Secretary determines that the contract includes an 
impermissible transfer of the Operating Fund or assets or is otherwise 
inconsistent with the terms and purposes of section 422 of the HEA.
    (b) Prohibited uses of Operating Fund assets. A guaranty agency may 
use the assets of the Operating Fund established under 
Sec. 682.410(a)(1) only as prescribed in Sec. 682.410(a)(2). Uses of the 
Operating Fund that are not allowable under Sec. 682.410(a)(2) include, 
but are not limited to--
    (1) Compensation for personnel services, including wages, salaries, 
pension plan costs, post-retirement health benefits, employee life 
insurance, unemployment benefit plans, severance pay, costs of leave, 
and other benefits, to the extent that total compensation to an 
employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent of the guaranty agency is 
not reasonable for the services rendered. Compensation is considered 
reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid in the labor 
market in which the guaranty agency competes for the kind of employees 
involved. Costs that are otherwise unallowable may not be considered 
allowable solely on the basis that they constitute personnel 
compensation. In no case may the Operating Fund be used to pay any 
compensation, whether calculated on an hourly basis or otherwise, that 
would be proportionately greater than 118.05 percent of the total salary 
paid (as calculated on an hourly basis) under section 5312 of title 5, 
United States Code (relating to Level I of the Executive Schedule).
    (2) Contributions and donations, including cash, property, and 
services, by the guaranty agency to others, regardless of the recipient 
or purpose, unless pursuant to written authorization from the Secretary;
    (3) Entertainment, including amusement, diversion, hospitality 
suites, and social activities, and any costs associated with those 
activities, such as tickets to shows or sports events, meals, alcoholic 
beverages, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities;
    (4) Fines, penalties, damages, and other settlements resulting from 
violations or alleged violations of the guaranty agency's failure to 
comply with Federal, State, or local laws and regulations that are 
unrelated to the FFEL Program, unless specifically approved by the 
Secretary. This prohibition does not apply if a non-criminal violation 
or alleged violation has been assessed against the guaranty agency, the 
payment does not reimburse an agency employee, and the payment does not 
exceed $1,000, or if it occurred as a result of compliance with specific 
requirements of the FFEL Program or in accordance with written 
instructions from the Secretary. The use of the Operating Fund in any 
other case must be

[[Page 778]]

requested by the agency and specifically approved in advance by the 
Secretary;
    (5) Legal expenses for prosecution of claims against the Federal 
Government, unless the guaranty agency substantially prevails on those 
claims. In that event, the Secretary approves the reimbursement of 
reasonable legal expenses incurred by the guaranty agency;
    (6) Lobbying activities, as defined in section 501(h) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, including dues to membership organizations to the 
extent that those dues are used for lobbying;
    (7) Major expenditures, including those for land, buildings, 
equipment, or information systems, whether singly or as a related group 
of expenditures, that exceed 5 percent of the guaranty agency's 
Operating Fund balance at the time the expenditures are made, unless the 
agency has provided written notice of the intended expenditure to the 
Secretary 30 days before the agency makes or commits itself to the 
expenditure. For those expenditures involving the purchase of an asset, 
the term ``major expenditure'' applies to costs such as the cost of 
purchasing the asset and making improvements to it, the cost to put it 
in place, the net invoice price of the asset, ancillary charges, such as 
taxes, duty, protective in-transit insurance, freight, and installation 
costs, and the costs of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or 
auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the asset usable for the purpose 
for which it was acquired, whether the expenditures are classified as 
capital or operating expenses;
    (8) Public relations, and all associated costs, paid directly or 
through a third party, to the extent that those costs are used to 
promote or maintain a favorable image of the guaranty agency. The term 
``public relations'' does not include any activity that is ordinary and 
necessary for the fulfillment of the agency's FFEL guaranty 
responsibilities under the HEA, including appropriate and reasonable 
advertising designed specifically to communicate with the public and 
program participants for the purpose of facilitating the agency's 
ability to fulfill its FFEL guaranty responsibilities under the HEA. 
Ordinary and necessary public relations activities include training of 
program participants and secondary school personnel and customer service 
functions that disseminate FFEL-related information and materials to 
schools, loan holders, prospective loan applicants, and their parents. 
In providing that training at workshops, conferences, or other ordinary 
and necessary forums customarily used by the agency to fulfill its 
responsibilities under the HEA, the agency may provide light meals and 
refreshments of a reasonable nature and amount to the participants;
    (9) Relocation of employees in excess of an employee's actual or 
reasonably estimated expenses or for purposes that do not benefit the 
administration of the guaranty agency's FFEL program. Except as approved 
by the Secretary, reimbursement must be in accordance with an 
established written policy; and
    (10) Travel expenses that are not in accordance with a written 
policy approved by the Secretary or a State policy. If the guaranty 
agency does not have such a policy, it may not use the assets of the 
Operating Fund to pay for travel expenses that exceed those allowed for 
lodging and subsistence under subchapter I of Chapter 57 of title 5, 
United States Code, or in excess of commercial airfare costs for 
standard coach airfare, unless those accommodations would require 
circuitous routing, travel during unreasonable hours, excessively 
prolonged travel, would result in increased cost that would offset 
transportation savings, or would offer accommodations not reasonably 
adequate for the medical needs of the traveler.
    (c) Cost allocation. Each guaranty agency that shares costs with any 
other program, agency, or organization shall develop a cost allocation 
plan consistent with the requirements described in OMB Circular A-87 and 
maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit. A 
guaranty agency is required to submit

[[Page 779]]

its cost allocation plans for the Secretary's approval if it is 
specifically requested to do so by the Secretary.

Sec. 682.420  Federal nonliquid assets.

    (a) General. The Federal portion of a nonliquid asset developed or 
purchased in whole or in part with Federal reserve funds, regardless of 
who held or controlled the Federal reserve funds or assets, is the 
property of the United States. The ownership of that asset must be 
prorated based on the percentage of the asset developed or purchased 
with Federal reserve funds. In maintaining and using the Federal portion 
of a nonliquid asset under this section, the guaranty agency must 
exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary charged with 
protecting, investing, and administering the property of others.
    (b) Treatment of revenue derived from a nonliquid Federal asset. If 
a guaranty agency derives revenue from the Federal portion of a 
nonliquid asset, including its sale or lease, the agency must promptly 
deposit the percentage of the net revenue received into the Federal Fund 
equal to the percentage of the asset owned by the United States.
    (c) Guaranty agency use of the Federal portion of a nonliquid asset. 
(1)(i) If a guaranty agency uses the Federal portion of a nonliquid 
asset in the performance of its guaranty activities (other than an 
intangible or intellectual property asset or a tangible asset of nominal 
value), the agency must promptly deposit into the Federal Fund an amount 
representing the net fair value of the use of the asset.
    (ii) If a guaranty agency uses the Federal portion of a nonliquid 
asset for purposes other than the performance of its guaranty 
activities, the agency must promptly deposit into the Federal Fund an 
amount representing the net fair value of the use of the asset.
    (2) Payments to the Federal Fund required by paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section must be made not less frequently than quarterly.

Sec. 682.421  Funds transferred from the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund by a guaranty agency.

    (a) General. In accordance with this section, a guaranty agency may 
request the Secretary's permission to transfer a limited amount of funds 
from the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund. Upon receiving the 
Secretary's approval, the agency may transfer the requested funds at any 
time within 6 months following the date specified by the Secretary. If 
the Secretary has not approved or disapproved the agency's request 
within 30 days after receiving it, the agency may transfer the requested 
funds at any time within the 6-month period beginning on the 31st day 
after the Secretary received the agency's request. The transferred funds 
may be used only as permitted by Secs. 682.410(a)(2) and 682.418.
    (b) Transferring the principal balance of the Federal Fund--(1) 
Amount that may be transferred. Upon receiving the Secretary's approval, 
an agency may transfer an amount up to the equivalent of 180 days of 
cash expenses for purposes allowed by Secs. 682.410(a)(2) and 682.418 
(not including claim payments) for normal operating expenses to be 
deposited into the agency's Operating Fund. The amount transferred and 
outstanding at any time during the first 3 years after establishing the 
Operating Fund may not exceed the lesser of 180 days cash expenses for 
purposes allowed by Secs. 682.410(a)(2) and 682.418 (not including claim 
payments), or 45 percent of the balance in the Federal reserve fund that 
existed under Sec. 682.410 as of September 30, 1998.
    (2) Requirements for requesting a transfer. A guaranty agency that 
wishes to transfer principal from the Federal Fund must provide the 
Secretary with

[[Page 781]]

a proposed repayment schedule and evidence that it can repay the 
transfer according to its proposed schedule. The agency must provide the 
Secretary with the following:
    (i) A request for the transfer that specifies the desired amount, 
the date the funds will be needed, and the agency's proposed terms of 
repayment;
    (ii) A projected revenue and expense statement, to be updated 
annually during the repayment period, that demonstrates that the agency 
will be able to repay the transferred amount within the repayment period 
requested by the agency; and
    (iii) Certifications by the agency that during the period while the 
transferred funds are outstanding--
    (A) Sufficient funds will remain in the Federal Fund to pay lender 
claims during the period the transferred funds are outstanding;
    (B) The agency will be able to meet the reserve recall requirements 
of section 422 of the Act;
    (C) The agency will be able to meet the statutory minimum reserve 
level of 0.25 percent, as mandated by section 428(c)(9) of the Act; and
    (D) No legal prohibition exists that would prevent the agency from 
obtaining or repaying the transferred funds.
    (c) Transferring interest earned on the Federal Fund. (1) Amount 
that may be transferred. The Secretary may permit an agency that owes 
the Federal Fund the maximum amount allowable under paragraph (b) of 
this section to transfer the interest income earned on the Federal Fund 
during the 3-year period following October 7, 1998. The combined amount 
of transferred interest and the amount of principal transferred under 
paragraph (b) of this section may exceed 180 days cash expenses for 
purposes allowed by Secs. 682.410(a)(2) and 682.418 (not including claim 
payments), but may not exceed 45 percent of the balance in the Federal 
reserve fund that existed under Sec. 682.410 as of September 30, 1998.
    (2) Requirements for requesting a transfer. To be allowed to 
transfer the interest income, in addition to the items in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, the agency must demonstrate to the Secretary 
that the cash flow in the Operating Fund will be negative if the agency 
is not authorized to transfer the interest, and, by transferring the 
interest, the agency will substantially improve its financial 
circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 682.422  Guaranty agency repayment of funds transferred from the Federal Fund.

    (a) General. A guaranty agency must begin repayment of money 
transferred from the Federal Fund not later than the start of the 4th 
year after the agency establishes its Operating Fund. All amounts 
transferred must be repaid not later than five years after the date the 
Operating Fund is established.
    (b) Extension for repaying the interest transferred--(1) General. 
The Secretary may extend the period for repayment of interest 
transferred from the Federal Fund from two years to five years if the 
Secretary determines that the cash flow of the Operating Fund will be 
negative if the transferred interest had to be repaid earlier or the 
repayment of the interest would substantially diminish the financial 
circumstances of the agency.
    (2) Agency eligibility for an extension. To receive an extension, 
the agency must demonstrate that it will be able to repay all 
transferred funds by the end of the 8th year following the date of 
establishment of the Operating Fund and that the agency will be 
financially sound upon the completion of repayment.
    (3) Repayment of interest earned on transferred funds. If the 
Secretary extends the period for repayment of interest transferred from 
the Federal Fund for a guaranty agency, the agency must repay the amount 
of interest during the 6th, 7th, and 8th years following the 
establishment of the Operating Fund. In addition to repaying the amount 
of interest, the guaranty agency must also pay to the Secretary any 
income earned after the 5th year from the investment of the transferred 
amount. In determining the amount of income earned on the transferred

[[Page 782]]

amount, the Secretary uses the average investment income earned on the 
agency's Operating Fund.
    (c) Consequences if a guaranty agency fails to repay transfers from 
the Federal Fund. If a guaranty agency fails to make a scheduled 
repayment to the Federal Fund, the agency may not receive any other 
Federal funds until it becomes current in making all scheduled payments, 
unless the Secretary waives this restriction.

Sec. 682.423  Guaranty agency Operating Fund.

    (a) Establishment and control. A guaranty agency must establish and 
maintain an Operating Fund in an account separate from the Federal Fund. 
Except for funds that have been transferred from the Federal Fund, the 
Operating Fund is considered the property of the guaranty agency. During 
periods in which the Operating Fund contains funds transferred from the 
Federal Fund, the Operating Fund may be used only as permitted by 
Secs. 682.410(a)(2) and 682.418.
    (b) Deposits. The guaranty agency must deposit into the Operating

remains after the Secretary's share of collections has been paid and the 
complement of the reinsurance percentage has been deposited into the 
Federal Fund;
    (7) The agency's share of the payoff amounts received from the 
consolidation or rehabilitation of defaulted loans; and
    (8) Other receipts as authorized by the Secretary.

    (iii) Enrollment and repayment status management;
    (iv) Default aversion activities;

<R05>
Sec. 682.500  Circumstances under which loans may be guaranteed by the Secretary.

    (a) The Secretary may guarantee all--
    (1) FISL, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS loans made by lenders 
located in a State in which no State or private nonprofit guaranty 
agency has in effect an agreement with the Secretary under Sec. 682.401 
to serve as guarantor in that State;
    (2) Federal Consolidation loans made by the Student Loan Marketing 
Association and Federal Consolidation loans made by any other lender 
that has applied for and been denied guarantee coverage on Consolidation 
loans by the guaranty agency that guarantees the largest dollar volume 
of FFEL loans made by the lender; and
    (3) FISL, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS, and Federal Consolidation loans 
made by lenders located in a State in which a guaranty agency program is 
operating but is not reasonably accessible to students who meet the 
agency's residency requirements.
    (b) The Secretary may guarantee FISL, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS and 
Federal Consolidation loans made by a lender located in a State where a 
guaranty agency operates a program that is reasonably accessible to 
students who meet the residency requirements of that program only for--

[[Page 783]]

    (1) A student who does not meet the agency's residency requirements;
    (2) A lender who is not able to obtain a guarantee from the guaranty 
agency for at least 80 percent of the loans the lender intends to make 
over a 12-month period because of the agency's residency requirements;
    (3) With the approval of the guaranty agency, a student who has 
previously received from the same lender a FISL loan that has not been 
repaid; or
    (4) All students at a school located in the State if the Secretary 
finds that--
    (i) No single guaranty agency program is reasonably accessible to 
students at that school as compared to students at other schools during 
a comparable period of time; and
    (ii) Guaranteeing loans made in the State to students attending that 
school would significantly increase the access of students at that 
school to FFEL Program loans. The Secretary may guarantee loans made to 
those students by a lender in that State if--
    (A) The guaranty agency does not recognize the school as being 
eligible, but the school is eligible under the FISL program; or
    (B) A majority of the persons enrolled at the school meet the 
conditions of student eligibility for FISL loans but are not recognized 
as eligible under the guaranty agency program.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a lender is 
considered to be located in the same State as a school if the lender--
    (1) Has an origination relationship with the school;
    (2) Has a majority of its voting stock held by the school; or
    (3) Has common ownership or management with the school and more than 
50 percent of the loans made by that lender are made to students at that 
school.
    (d) As a condition for guaranteeing loans under the Federal FFEL 
programs, the Secretary may require the lender to submit evidence of 
circumstances that would justify loan guarantees under the provisions of 
this section.
    (e) With regard to a school lender that has entered into an 
agreement with the Secretary under Sec. 682.600, the Secretary denies 
loan guarantees on the basis of this section only if the Secretary first 
determines that all eligible students at that school who make a 
conscientious effort to obtain a loan from another lender will find a 
loan to be reasonably available. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
determination of loan availability is based on studies and surveys that 
the Secretary considers satisfactory.

Sec. 682.501  Extent of Federal guarantee under the Federal GSL programs.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Secretary's guarantee liability on any Federal GSL loan is 100 
percent of the unpaid principal balance and, to the extent permitted 
under Sec. 682.512, accrued interest.
    (b) Special provisions for State lenders. (1) Except as described in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary's guarantee liability is 
less than 100 percent under the following conditions:
    (i) If the total of default claims under the Federal GSL programs 
paid by the Secretary to a State lender during any fiscal year reaches 
five percent of the amount of the Federal GSL loans in repayment at the 
end of the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary's guarantee liability on 
a claim subsequently paid during that fiscal year is 90 percent of the 
amount of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest.
    (ii) If the total of default claims under the Federal GSL programs 
paid by the Secretary to a State lender during any fiscal year reaches 
nine percent of the amount of the Federal GSL loans in repayment at the 
end of the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary's guarantee liability on 
a claim subsequently paid during that fiscal year is 80 percent of the 
amount of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest.
    (iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the total default claims paid 
by the Secretary during any fiscal year do not include paid claims filed 
by the lender under the provisions of Sec. 682.412(e) or Sec. 682.509.
    (2) The potential reduction in guarantee liability does not apply to 
a State lender during the first Federal fiscal year of its operation as 
a Federal

[[Page 784]]

GSL Program lender and during each of the four succeeding fiscal years.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the term ``amount of the 
Federal GSL loans in repayment'' means the original principal amount of 
all loans guaranteed by the Secretary less--
    (i) The original principal amount of loans on which--
    (A) Under the FISL program, the borrower has not yet reached the 
repayment period;
    (B) Payment in full has been made by the borrower;
    (C) The borrower was in deferment status at the time repayment of 
principal was scheduled to begin and remains in deferment status; or
    (D) The Secretary has paid a claim filed under section 437 of the 
Act; and
    (ii) The amount paid by the Secretary for default claims on loans, 
exclusive of paid claims filed by the lender under Sec. 682.412(e) or 
Sec. 682.509.
    (4) For the purposes of this paragraph, payments by the Secretary on 
a loan that the original lender assigned to a subsequent holder are 
considered payments made to the original lender.
    (5) State lenders shall consolidate Federal GSL loans for the 
purpose of calculating the amount of the Secretary's guarantee liability 
under this section.

    (a) To be considered for participation in the Federal GSL programs, 
a lender shall submit an application to the Secretary.
    (b) In determining whether to enter into a guarantee agreement with 
an applicant, and, if so, what the terms of the agreement will be, the 
Secretary considers--
    (1) Whether the applicant meets the definition of an ``eligible 
lender'' in section 435(d) of the Act and the definition of ``lender`' 
in Sec. 682.200;
    (2) Whether the applicant is capable of complying with the 
regulations in this part as they apply to lenders;
    (3) Whether the applicant is capable of implementing adequate 
procedures for making, servicing, and collecting loans;
    (4) Whether the applicant has had prior experience with a similar 
Federal, State, or private nonprofit student loan program, and the 
amount and percentage of loans that are currently delinquent or in 
default under that program;
    (5) The financial resources of the applicant; and
    (6) In the case of a school that is seeking approval as a lender,

guarantee agreement, the Secretary's response includes the reason for 
the decision.
    (2) The Secretary provides the lender an opportunity for the lender 
to meet with a designated Department official if the lender wishes to 
appeal the Secretary's decision.
    (3) However, the Secretary need not explain the reasons for the 
denial or grant the lender an opportunity to appeal if the lender 
submits its application within six months of a previous denial.

Sec. 682.503  The guarantee agreement.

    (a)(1) To participate in the Federal GSL programs, a lender must 
have a guarantee agreement with the Secretary. The Secretary does not 
guarantee a loan unless it is covered by such an agreement.
    (2) In general, under a guarantee agreement the lender agrees to 
comply with all laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to 
its participation as a lender in the Federal GSL programs. In return, 
the Secretary agrees to guarantee each eligible Federal GSL loan held by 
the lender against the borrower's default, death, total and permanent 
disability, or bankruptcy.
    (3) The Secretary may include in an agreement a limit on the 
duration of the agreement and the number or amount of Federal GSL loans 
the lender may make or hold.

[[Page 785]]

    (b)(1) Except as otherwise approved by the Secretary, a guarantee 
agreement with a school lender limits the Federal GSL loans made by that 
school lender that will be covered by the Federal guarantee to those 
loans made to students, or to parents borrowing on behalf of students, 
who are--
    (i) In attendance at that school;
    (ii) In attendance at other schools under the same ownership as that 
school; or
    (iii) Employees or dependents of employees, or whose parents are 
employees, of that school lender or other schools under the same 
ownership, under circumstances the Secretary considers appropriate for 
loan guarantees.
    (2) The Secretary may on a school-by-school basis impose limits 
under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section on a school lender that 
makes loans to students or to parents of students in attendance at other 
schools under the same ownership, or to employees, or to dependents or 
parents of employees, of those other schools.

Sec. 682.504  Issuance of Federal loan guarantees.

    (a) A lender having a guarantee agreement shall submit an 
application to the Secretary for a Federal loan guarantee on each 
intended loan that the lender determines to be eligible for a guarantee. 
The application must be on a form prescribed by the Secretary. The 
Secretary notifies the lender whether the loan will be guaranteed and of 
the amount of the guarantee. No disbursement on a loan made prior to the 
Secretary's approval of that loan is covered by the guarantee.
    (b) The Secretary issues a guarantee on a Federal GSL loan in 
reliance on the implied representations of the lender that all 
requirements for the initial eligibility of the loan for guarantee 
coverage have been met. As described in Sec. 682.513, the continuance of 
the guarantee is conditioned upon compliance by all holders of the loan 
with the regulations in this part.

Sec. 682.505  Insurance premium.

    (a) General. The Secretary charges the lender an insurance premium 
for each Federal GSL Program loan that is guaranteed, except that no 
insurance premium is charged on a Federal Consolidation loan, or on a 
Federal SLS or Federal PLUS loan made under Sec. 682.209(f).
    (b) Rate. The rate of the insurance premium is one-fourth of one 
percent per year of the loan principal, excluding interest or other 
charges that may have been added to the principal.
    FISL loans--insurance premium calculation. (1) The insurance premium 
for FISL loans is calculated by--
    (i) Counting the number of months beginning with the month following 
the month in which each disbursement on the loan is to be made and 
ending 12 months after the borrower's anticipated graduation from the 
school for attendance at which the loan is sought;
    (ii) Dividing one-fourth of one percent of the principal amount of 
the loan by 12; and
    (iii) Multiplying the result obtained in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section by that obtained in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) If the lender disburses the loan in multiple installments, the 
insurance premium is calculated for each disbursement from the month 
following the month that the disbursement is made.
    (d) Federal PLUS and SLS Loans--insurance premium calculation. The 
insurance premium for a Federal PLUS or SLS loan is calculated by--
    (1) Using the projected repayment period as a base;
    (2) Amortizing the loan in equal monthly installments over the 
repayment period;
    (3) Determining one-fourth of one percent of each monthly declining 
principal balance; and
    (4) Computing the total of monthly amounts calculated under 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (e) Collection from lenders. (1) The Secretary may bill the lender 
for the insurance premium or may require the lender to pay the insurance 
premium to the Secretary at the time of disbursement of the loan. At the 
Secretary's discretion, the Secretary may

[[Page 786]]

alternatively collect the insurance premium by offsetting it against 
amounts payable by the Secretary to the lender.
    (2) The Secretary's guarantee on a loan ceases to be effective if 
the lender fails to pay the insurance premium within 60 days of the date 
payment is due. However, the Secretary may excuse late payment of an 
insurance premium and reinstate the guarantee coverage on a loan if the 
Secretary is satisfied that at the time the premium is paid--
    (i) The loan is not in default and the borrower is not delinquent in 
making installment payments; or
    (ii) The loan is in default, or the borrower is delinquent, under 
circumstances where the borrower has entered the repayment period 
without the lender's knowledge.
    Collection from borrowers. The lender may pass along the cost of the 
insurance premium to the borrower. If it does so, the insurance premium 
must be deducted from each disbursement of the loan in an amount 
proportionate to that disbursement's contribution to the premium amount.
    (g) Refund provisions. The insurance premium is not refundable by 
the Secretary and need not be refunded by the lender to the borrower, 
even if the borrower prepays, defaults, dies, becomes totally and 
permanently disabled, or files a petition in bankruptcy.

Sec. 682.506  Limitations on maximum loan amounts.

    (a) The Secretary does not guarantee a FISL, Federal SLS, or Federal 
PLUS loan in an amount that would--
    (1) Result in an annual loan amount in excess of the student's 
estimated cost of attendance for the period of enrollment for which the 
loan is intended less--
    (i) The student's estimated financial assistance; and
    (ii) The student's expected family contribution for that period, in 
the case of a FISL loan; or
    (2) Result in an annual or aggregate loan amount in excess of the 
permissible annual and aggregate loan limits described in Sec. 682.204.
    (b) The Secretary does not guarantee a Federal Consolidation loan in 
an amount greater than that required to discharge loans eligible for 
consolidation under Sec. 682.100(a)(4).

Sec. 682.507  Due diligence in collecting a loan.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, a lender shall exercise due diligence in the collection of a 
loan with respect to both a borrower and an authorized endorser. In 
order to exercise due diligence, a lender shall implement the procedures 
described in this section if a borrower fails to make an installment 
payment when due.
    (2) If two borrowers are liable for repayment of a Federal PLUS or 
Federal Consolidation loan as co-makers, the lender must follow these 
procedures with respect to both borrowers.
    (3) For purposes of this section, the borrower's delinquency begins 
on the day after the due date of an installment payment not paid when 
due, except that if the borrower entered the repayment period without 
the lender's knowledge, the delinquency begins 30 days after the day the 
lender receives notice that the borrower has entered the repayment 
period.
    (4) In lieu of the procedures described in this section, a lender 
may use the due diligence procedures in Sec. 682.411 in collecting a 
Federal GSL loan.
    (b) Initial delinquency. If a borrower is delinquent in making a 
payment, the lender shall remind the borrower within 10 working days of 
the date the payment was due by means of a letter, notice, telephone 
call, or personal contact. If payments do not begin or resume, the 
lender shall attempt to contact the borrower--
    (1) At last six more times at regular intervals during the remainder 
of the six-month period that started on the date of delinquency for 
loans repayable in monthly installments; or

[[Page 787]]

    (2) At least eight more times during the remainder of the eight-
month period that started on the date of delinquency for loans repayable 
in installments less frequent than monthly.
    (c) Skip-tracing assistance. (1) If a lender does not know the 
borrower's current address, the lender promptly shall attempt to locate 
the borrower through normal commercial collection activities, including 
contacting all individuals and entities named in the borrower's loan 
application. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the lender promptly 
shall attempt to learn the borrower's current address through use of the 
Department's skip-tracing assistance.
    (2) If the lender does not know the borrower's address when a 
borrower is first delinquent in making a payment, but subsequently 
obtains the borrower's address prior to the date on which the loan goes 
into default, the lender shall attempt to contact the borrower in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, with the first contact 
occurring within 15 days of the date the lender obtained knowledge of 
the borrower's address, and shall attempt to contact the borrower at 
least once during each succeeding 30-day period until default.
    (d) Preclaims assistance. When the borrower is 60 days delinquent in 
making a payment, the lender shall request preclaims assistance from the 
Department of Education. This preclaims assistance consists of sending a 
series of letters to the borrower, urging the borrower to contact the 
lender and begin or resume payments.
    (e) Final demand letter. A lender shall send a final demand letter 
to the borrower at least 30 days before the lender files a default 
claim. The lender shall allow the borrower at least 30 days to respond 
to the final demand letter. However, a lender need not send a final 
demand letter to a borrower whose address is unknown to the lender.
    (f) Litigation. (1) If a loan is in default and the lender 
determines that the borrower or an endorser has the ability to repay the 
loan, the lender may bring suit against the borrower or the endorser to 
recover the amount of the unpaid principal and interest, together with 
reasonable attorneys' fees, late charges, and court costs.
    (2) Prior to bringing suit the lender shall--
    (i) Obtain the Secretary's approval; and
    (ii) Notify the borrower or endorser in writing that it has received 
the Secretary's approval to bring suit on the loan, and that unless the 
borrower or endorser makes payments sufficient to bring the account out 
of default the lender will seek a judgment under which the borrower or 
endorser will be liable for payment of late charges, attorneys' fees, 
collection agency charges, court costs, and other reasonable collection 
costs in addition to the unpaid principal and interest on the loan. The 
lender shall mail the notice to the borrower or endorser by certified 
mail, return receipt requested.
    (3) The lender may bring suit if the borrower or endorser does not 
make payments sufficient to bring the account out of default within 10 
days following the date of delivery of the notice described in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii) of this section to the borrower or endorser indicated on the 
receipt.
    (4) A lender may first apply the proceeds of any judgment against 
its attorneys' fees, court costs, collection agency charges, and other 
reasonable collection costs, whether or not the judgment provides for 
these fees and costs.

Sec. 682.508  Assignment of a loan.

    (a) General. A Federal GSL loan may not be assigned except to 
another eligible lender. For the purpose of this paragraph, ``assigned'' 
means any kind of transfer of an interest in the loan, including a 
pledge of such an interest as security.
    (b)(1) Procedure. If the assignment of a FISL Program loan is to 
result in a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower 
must send subsequent payments, the assignor and the

[[Page 788]]

assignee of the loan shall, no later than 45 days from the date the 
assignee acquires a legally enforceable right to receive payment from 
the borrower on the assigned loan, provide separate notices to the 
borrower of--
    (i) The assignment;
    (ii) The identity of the assignee;
    (iii) The name and address of the party to whom subsequent payments 
must be sent; and
    (iv) The telephone numbers of both the assignor and the assignee.
    (2) The assignor and assignee shall provide the notice required by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section separately. Each notice must indicate 
that a corresponding notice will be sent by the other party to the 
assignment.
    (c) The Secretary's approval. The approval of the Secretary is 
required prior to the assignment of a note to an eligible lender that 
has not entered into a contract of insurance with the Secretary under 
Sec. 682.503.
    (d) Warranty. (1) Nothing in this section precludes the buyer of a 
loan from obtaining a warranty from the seller covering certain future 
reductions by the Secretary in computing the amount of guaranteed loss, 
if any, on a claim filed on the loan.
    (2) The warranty may cover only reductions that are attributable to 
an act or failure to act of the seller or other previous holder.
    (3) The warranty may not cover matters the buyer is responsible for 
under the regulations in this part.

    (i) The loan is in default, as defined in Sec. 682.200.
    (ii) Any of the conditions exist for filing a claim without 
collection efforts, as set forth in Sec. 682.412(e)(2) or Sec. 682.509.
    (iii) The borrower has died, become totally and permanently 
disabled, or filed a bankruptcy petition, as determined by the lender in 
accordance with Sec. 682.510.
    (2) If a Federal PLUS loan was obtained by two eligible parents as 
co-makers, or a Federal Consolidation loan was obtained jointly by a 
married couple, the reason for filing a claim must hold true for both 
applicants, or each applicant must have satisfied a claimable criterion 
at the time of the request for discharge of the loan.
    (3) A lender may file a claim against the Secretary's guarantee only 
on a form provided by the Secretary. The lender shall attach to the 
claim all documents required by the Secretary.

[[Page 789]]

If the lender fails to do so, the Secretary denies the claim.
    (b) Documentation required for claims. (1) The Secretary requires a 
lender to submit the following documentation with all claims:
    (i) The original promissory note.
    (ii) The loan application.

    (c) Assignment of note. The Secretary's payment of a claim is 
contingent upon receipt from the lender of an assignment to the United 
States of America of all rights, title, and interest of the lender in 
the note underlying the claim.
    (d) Bankruptcy subsequent to default. If the lender files a default 
claim on a loan and subsequently receives a notice of the first meeting 
of creditors in the proceeding of the borrower in bankruptcy, the lender 
shall promptly forward that notice to the Department of Education. Under 
these circumstances the lender shall not file a proof of claim with the 
bankruptcy court.
    (e) Claim filing deadlines. To obtain payment of a claim, a lender 
shall comply with the following deadlines:

Sec. 682.512  Determination of amount payable on a claim.

    (a) Default claims. (1) Amount payable. The amount of loss to be 
paid on a default claim depends upon the date the Secretary received the 
application for a guarantee commitment on the loan. If the application 
was received--
    (i) Prior to July 1, 1972, or from August 19, 1972 through February 
28, 1973, the amount payable on a valid claim is equal to the unpaid 
balance of the original principal loan amount disbursed; or
    (ii) From July 1 through August 18, 1972, or after February 28, 
1973, the amount payable on a valid claim is equal to the unpaid balance 
of the principal and interest in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section. The unpaid principal amount of the loan may

[[Page 790]]

include capitalized interest to the extent authorized by 
Sec. 682.202(b).
    (2) Payment of interest. If the guarantee covers unpaid interest, 
the payment of a valid claim covers the unpaid interest that accrues 
during the following periods:
    (i) During the period before the claim is filed, not to exceed the 
period provided for in Sec. 682.511(e) for filing the claim.
    (ii) During a period not to exceed 30 days following the return of 
the claim to the lender by the Secretary for additional documentation 
necessary for the claim to be approved by the Secretary.
    (iii) During the period, after the claim is filed, that is required 
by the Secretary to approve the claim and to authorize payment or to 
return the claim to the lender for additional documentation.
    (3) Recovery of outstanding debts. The Secretary may reduce the 
amount of loss due to the lender on a claim by the amount the Secretary 
determines is owed to the Secretary by the lender.
    (b) Death, total and permanent disability, or bankruptcy claims. (1) 
In the case of a death or disability claim, the amount to be paid on a 
valid claim--
    (i) Is equal to the unpaid balance of the original principal loan 
amount disbursed if the loan was disbursed prior to December 15, 1968; 
or
    (ii) Is calculated in accordance with Sec. 682.402(h)(2) and (h)(3) 
if the loan was disbursed after December 14, 1968.
    (2) In the case of a bankruptcy claim, the amount of loss is 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 682.402(f)(2) and (f)(3).
    (3) For purposes of this section, references to the ``guaranty 
agency'' in Sec. 682.402(f)(3) mean the Secretary.
    (c) Special rules for a loan acquired by assignment. If a claim is 
filed by a lender that obtained a loan by assignment, that lender is not 
entitled to any payment under this section greater than that to which a 
previous holder would have been entitled. For example, the Secretary 
deducts from the claim any amounts that are attributable to payments 
made by the borrower to a prior holder of the loan before the borrower 
received proper notice of the assignment of the loan.

Sec. 682.513  Factors affecting coverage of a loan under the loan guarantee.

    (a)(1) In determining whether to approve for payment a claim against 
the Secretary's guarantee, the Secretary considers matters affecting the 
enforceability of the loan obligation and whether the loan was made and 
administered in accordance with the Act and applicable regulations.
    (2) The Secretary deducts from a claim any amount that is not a 
legally enforceable obligation of the borrower, except to the extent 
that the defense of infancy applies.
    (3) Except as provided in Sec. 682.509, the Secretary does not pay a 
claim unless--
    (i) All holders of the loan have complied with the requirements of 
this part, including, but not limited to, those concerning due diligence 
in the making, servicing, and collecting of a loan;
    (ii) The current holder has complied with the deadlines for filing a 
claim established in Sec. 682.511(e); and
    (iii) The current holder complies with the requirements for 
submitting documents with a claim as established in Sec. 682.511(b).
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 682.509, the Secretary does not pay a 
death, disability, or bankruptcy claim for a loan after a default claim 
for that loan has been disapproved by the Secretary or if it would not 
be payable as a default claim by the Secretary.
    (c) The Secretary's determination of the amount of loss payable on a 
default claim under this part, once final, is conclusive and binding on 
the lender that filed the claim.
    Note: A determination of the Secretary under this section is subject 
to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 706 and 41 U.S.C. 321-322.

maintained in a system that allows ready identification of each loan's 
current status.
    (2) A lender shall retain the records required for each loan for not 
less than five years following the date the loan is repaid in full by 
the borrower or the lender is reimbursed on a claim. However, in 
particular cases the Secretary may require the retention of records 
beyond this minimum period.
    (3)(i) The lender may store the records specified in 
Sec. 682.414(a)(3)(ii)(C)-(K) on microfilm, optical disk, or other

application.
    (b) Reports. A lender shall submit reports to the Secretary at the

regulations and to any other pertinent books, documents, papers, 
computer programs, and records; and
    (2) Providing reasonable access to lender personnel associated with

Sec. 682.600  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 682.601  Rules for a school that makes or originates loans.

    (a) General. To make or originate loans under the FFEL programs--
    (1) The school shall employ full-time at least one person whose 
responsibilities are limited to the administration

[[Page 792]]

of financial aid programs for students attending the school;
    (2) The school may not be a correspondence school;
    (3) The school may not make or originate loans that would be 
outstanding to or on behalf of more than 50 percent of the 
undergraduates in attendance at that school on at least a half-time 
basis unless the Secretary waives this rule pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section;
    (4) The school shall inform any undergraduate student who has not 
previously obtained a loan that was made or originated by the school and 
who seeks to obtain such a loan that he or she must first make a good 
faith effort to obtain a loan from a commercial lender;
    (5)(i) The school may not make or originate a loan for an academic 
period to a student described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section until 
the student provides the school with evidence under paragraph (b) of 
this section of denial of a loan by a commercial lender for the same 
academic period.
    (ii) In determining whether a school has complied with the 
requirement set paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the Secretary may 
take into consideration any patterns reflected by the letters of denial 
or the students' sworn statements referred to in paragraph (b) of this 
section that indicate that the school has not given sufficient 
counseling to students to seek loans from a commercial lender first. An 
example of an unacceptable pattern would be if all denials of loans to a 
school's students were made by a small number of lenders; and
    (6) The school's cohort default rate as calculated under subpart M 
of 34 CFR part 668 may not exceed 15 percent; and
    (7) Except for reasonable administrative expenses directly related 
to the FFEL Program, the school must use payments received under 
Sec. 682.300 and Sec. 682.302 for need-based grant programs for its 
students.
    (b) Establishing a loan denial by a commercial lender. (1) To verify 
that a borrower has sought and been denied a loan from a commercial 
lender pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the school shall 
obtain from the borrower--
    (i) A written statement from a commercial lender indicating that the 
lender denied the borrower a loan for that academic period; or
    (ii) The borrower's sworn statement, indicating both the refusal of 
a loan by a commercial lender and the lender's refusal to provide a 
written statement of the denial.
    (2) If the borrower's statement is used to establish the denial of a 
loan, the statement must include--
    (i) The name and address of the lender that denied the loan;
    (ii) The approximate date on which the loan was denied;
    (iii) The name and telephone number of the official who communicated 
the denial to the borrower; and
    (iv) The borrower's signature.
    (3) If the school determines that the denial of a loan to an 
eligible borrower by a commercial lender is based upon the lender's 
refusal to lend more than a part of the amount requested by the 
borrower, the school may either--
    (i) Make or originate a loan to the borrower for the entire amount; 
or
    (ii) Supplement the loan that the commercial lender is willing to 
make with a second loan to the borrower.
    (c) Waiver of the 50 percent lending limit. A school may request the 
Secretary to waive the 50 percent lending limit described in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section if adherence to that limit would create a 
substantial hardship for the school's present or prospective students. 
The Secretary determines whether to grant the school a waiver after 
considering, among other factors--
    (1) The extent to which the school provides and expects to continue 
providing educational opportunities to economically disadvantaged 
students, as measured by the percentage of those students enrolled at 
the school who--
    (i) Are in families that fall within the ``low-income family'' 
category used by the Bureau of the Census;
    (ii) Would not be able to enroll or continue their enrollment at 
that school without Stafford or PLUS loans made or originated by the 
school; and
    (iii) Would not be able to obtain a comparable education at another 
school;

[[Page 793]]

    (2) The extent to which the school offers educational programs that-
-
    (i) Are unique in the geographical area the school serves; and
    (ii) Would not be available to some students if the school adhered 
to the 50 percent lending limit; and
    (3) The quality of the school's--
    (i) Management of student financial assistance programs; and
    (ii) Conformance with sound business practices.

    (2) Exceeds the student's estimated cost of attendance, less--
    (i) The student's estimated financial assistance for that period; 
and
    (ii) In the case of a Stafford loan that is eligible for interest 
benefits, the borrower's expected family contribution for that period.
    (e) A school may refuse to certify a Stafford or PLUS loan 
application or may reduce the borrower's determination of need for the

    (2) The documentation supporting the determination is retained in 
the student's file; and
    (3) The school does not engage in any pattern or practice that

status, income, or selection of a particular lender or guaranty agency.
    (f)(1) The minimum period of enrollment for which a school may 
certify a loan application is--

uses a semester, trimester, or quarter system, a single academic term 
(e.g., a semester or quarter); or
    (ii) At a school that measures academic progress in clock hours, or 
measures academic progress in credit hours but does not use a semester, 
trimester, or quarter system, the lesser of--
    (A) The length of the student's program at the school; or
    (B) The academic year as defined by the school in accordance with 34 
CFR 668.2.
    (2) The maximum period for which a school may certify a loan 
application is--
    (i) Generally an academic year, as defined by 34 CFR 668.2, except 
that a guaranty agency may allow a school to use a longer period of 
time, not to exceed 12 months, corresponding to the period to which the

[[Page 794]]

annual loan limits under Sec. 682.401(b)(2)(ii); or
    (ii) For a defaulted borrower who has regained eligibility under 
Sec. 682.401(b)(4), the academic year in which the borrower regained

an eligible student is enrolled changes after the school certifies the 
loan.
    (g)(1) A school must cease certifying loans based on the exceptions 
in Sec. 682.604(c)(5)(i) and Sec. 682.604(c)(10)(i) no later than--

borrower with the notice as described under Sec. 668.165.
    (3) Except as provided in Sec. 668.167, if the school is placed 
under the reimbursement payment method, a school shall not disburse a

    (2)(i) Except in the case of a late disbursement under paragraph (e) 
of this section or as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this

eligibility in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 682.201 for the 
loan period certified by the school on the student's loan application.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) If, after the proceeds of the first disbursement are

the school's loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV 
programs, the school may transmit the proceeds of the second or 
subsequent disbursement to the borrower as permitted by Sec. 668.26.
    (iv) If, prior to the transmittal of the proceeds of a disbursement

disbursement received from a lender under Sec. 682.207(f) in accordance 
with Sec. 668.164(g).
    (2) If the total amount of the late disbursement and all prior 
disbursements is greater than that portion of the borrower's educational 
charges, the school shall return the balance of the borrower's loan 
proceeds to the lender with a notice certifying--
    (i) The beginning and ending dates of the period during which the 
borrower was enrolled at the school as an eligible student during the 
loan period or payment period; and
    (ii) The borrower's corrected financial need for the loan for that 
period of enrollment or payment period.
    (f) Initial counseling. (1) A school must conduct initial counseling 
with each Stafford loan borrower either in person, by audiovisual 
presentation, or by interactive electronic means prior to its release of 
the first disbursement, unless the student borrower has received a prior 
Stafford, SLS, or Direct loan. A school must ensure that an individual 
with expertise in the title IV programs is reasonably available shortly 
after the counseling to answer the student borrower's questions 
regarding those programs. As an alternative, in the case of a student 
borrower enrolled in a correspondence program or a student borrower 
enrolled in a study-abroad program that the home institution approves 
for credit, the school may provide the counseling through written 
materials, prior to releasing those loan proceeds.
    (2) In conducting the initial counseling, the school must--
    (i) Explain the use of a Master Promissory Note;
    (ii) Emphasize to the student borrower the seriousness and 
importance of the repayment obligation the student borrower is assuming;
    (iii) Describe in forceful terms the likely consequences of default, 
including adverse credit reports and litigation; and
    (iv) In the case of a student borrower of a Stafford loan (other 
than a loan made or originated by the school), emphasize that the 
student borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan even 
if the student borrower does not complete the program, is unable to 
obtain employment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or 
does not receive the educational or other services that the student 
borrower purchased from the school.
    (3) A school that conducts initial counseling through interactive 
electronic means must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student 
borrower receives the counseling materials, and participates in and 
completes the initial counseling.
    (4) A school must maintain documentation substantiating the school's 
compliance with this section for each student borrower.

[[Page 798]]

    (g) Exit counseling. (1) A school must conduct exit counseling with 
each Stafford loan borrower either in person, by audiovisual 
presentation, or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the 
school must conduct this counseling shortly before the student borrower 
ceases at least half-time study at the school. As an alternative, in the 
case of a student borrower enrolled in a correspondence program or a 
study-abroad program that the home institution approves for credit, the 
school may provide written counseling materials by mail within 30 days 
after the student borrower completes the program. If a student borrower 
withdraws from school without the school's prior knowledge or fails to 
complete an exit counseling session as required, the school must provide 
exit counseling through either interactive electronic means or by 
mailing written counseling materials to the student borrower at the 
student borrower's last known address within 30 days after learning that 
the student borrower has withdrawn from school or failed to complete the 
exit counseling as required.
    (2) In conducting the exit counseling, the school must--
    (i) Inform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly 
repayment amount based on the student borrower's indebtedness or on the 
average indebtedness of student borrowers who have obtained Stafford or 
SLS loans for attendance at that school or in the student borrower's 
program of study;
    (ii) Review for the student borrower available repayment options 
(e.g., loan consolidation, refinancing of SLS loans);
    (iii) Suggest to the student borrower debt-management strategies 
that the school determines would best assist repayment by the student 
borrower;
    (iv) Include the matters described in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section;
    (v) Review with the student borrower the conditions under which the 
student borrower may defer repayment or obtain a full or partial 
cancellation of a loan;
    (vi) Require the student borrower to provide corrections to the 
institution's records concerning name, address, social security number, 
references, and driver's license number, as well as the student 
borrower's expected permanent address, the address of the student 
borrower's next of kin, and the name and address of the student 
borrower's expected employer, that will then be provided within 60 days 
to the guaranty agency or agencies listed in the student borrower's 
records; and
    (vii) Review with the student borrower information on the 
availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.
    (3) A school that conducts exit counseling by electronic interactive 
means must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student borrower 
receives the counseling materials, and participates in and completes the 
counseling.
    (4) The school must maintain documentation substantiating the 
school's compliance with this section for each student borrower.
    (h) Treatment of excess loan proceeds. Except as provided under 
paragraph (i) of this section, or in the case of a student attending a 
foreign school, if, before the delivery of any Stafford or SLS loan 
disbursement, the school learns that the borrower will receive or has 
received financial aid for the period of enrollment for which the loan 
was made that exceeds the amount of assistance for which the student is 
eligible, the school shall reduce or eliminate the overaward by either--
    (1) Using the student's SLS, PLUS, nonsubsidized or unsubsidized 
Stafford, or State-sponsored or private loan to cover the expected 
family contribution, if not already done;
    (2)(i) Returning the entire undelivered disbursement to the lender 
or escrow agent; and
    (ii) Providing the lender with a written statement--
    (A) Describing the reason for the return of the funds, if any;
    (B) Setting forth the student's revised financial need; and
    (C) Directing the lender to re-disburse a revised amount and, if 
necessary, revise subsequent disbursements to eliminate the overaward; 
or
    (3) Returning to the lender any portion of the disbursement for 
which the student is ineligible and providing the

[[Page 799]]

lender with a written statement explaining the return of the funds.
    (i) For purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, funds obtained 
from any Federal College Work-Study employment that do not exceed the 
borrower's financial need by more than $300 may not be considered as 
excess loan proceeds.

    (1) Must pay that portion of the student's refund or return of title 
IV, HEA program funds that is allocable to a FFEL loan to--

school makes a payment of a refund or a return of title IV, HEA program 
funds to a lender on behalf of that student.
    (b) Allocation of a refund or returned title IV, HEA program funds.

Sec. 682.608  Termination of a school's lending eligibility.

    (a) General. The Secretary may terminate a school's eligibility to 
make loans under this part if the school reaches the 15 percent limit on 
loan defaults described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The 15 percent limit. (1) The Secretary may terminate a school's 
eligibility to make loans if at the end of each of the 2 most recent 
consecutive Federal fiscal years for which data are

[[Page 800]]

available, the total amount of loans described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section is equal to or greater than 15 percent of the total amount 
of loans described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section as follows:
    (i) The original principal amount of all loans the school has ever 
made that went into default during that period.
    (ii) The original principal amount of all loans the school has ever 
made, including loans in deferment status that--
    (A) Were in repayment status at the beginning of that period; or
    (B) Entered repayment status during that period.
    (2) In making the determination under this section, the Secretary 
considers the status of all FFEL loans made by the school whether the 
loans are held by the school or by a subsequent holder.
    (c) Exception based on hardship. The Secretary does not terminate a 
school's lending eligibility under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section if the Secretary determines that the termination would result in 
a hardship for the school or its students. The Secretary makes this 
determination if the school shows that--
    (1) Termination is not justified in light of recent improvements the 
school has made in its collection capabilities that will reduce the 
school's loan default rate significantly within the next year. Examples 
of these improvements include--
    (i) Adopting more efficient collection procedures; or
    (ii) Employing increased collection staff; or
    (2) Termination would cause a substantial hardship to the school's 
current or prospective students or their parents based on--
    (i) The extent to which the school provides, and expects to continue 
to provide educational opportunities to economically disadvantaged 
students as measured by the percentage of students enrolled at the 
school who--
    (A) Are in families that fall within the ``low-income family'' 
category used by the Bureau of the Census;
    (B) Would not be able to enroll or continue their enrollment at that 
school without a loan from the school; and
    (C) Would not be able to obtain a comparable education at another 
school;
    (ii) The extent to which the school offers educational programs 
that--
    (A) Are unique in the geographical area that the school serves; and
    (B) Would not be available to some students if they or their parents 
could not obtain loans from the school; and
    (iii) The quality of improvements the school has made in its--
    (A) Management of student financial assistance programs; and
    (B) Conformance with sound business practices.
    (d) Termination procedures. (1) The Secretary notifies the school of 
the proposed termination of its lending eligibility and provides an 
opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary terminates the school 
under this section.
    (2) The Secretary or his designee begins a termination action by 
sending a notice to the school. The notice is sent by certified mail 
with return receipt requested. The notice--
    (i) Informs the school of the intent to terminate the school's 
lending eligibility because of the school's default experience;
    (ii) Specifies the proposed date the termination becomes effective; 
and
    (iii) Informs the school that it has 15 days to--
    (A) Submit any written material it wants considered in determining 
whether its lending eligibility should be terminated under paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section, including written material in support of a 
hardship exception under paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (B) Request an oral hearing to show why the school's lending 
eligibility should not be terminated.
    (3) If the school does not request an oral hearing but submits 
written material, the Secretary or the designated official considers 
that material and notifies the school as to whether the termination 
action will be taken.
    (4) The Secretary or the designated official (presiding officer) 
schedules the date and place of a hearing for a school that has 
requested an oral hearing. The date of the hearing is at least 15 days

[[Page 801]]

from the date of receipt of the request. A presiding officer--
    (i) Conducts the hearing;
    (ii) Considers all written material presented before the hearing and 
any other material presented during the hearing; and
    (iii) Determines if termination of the school's lending eligibility 
is warranted.
    (5) The decision of the designated official is subject to review by 
the Secretary.
    (e) Effects of termination. A school that has its lending 
eligibility terminated under this section may not--
    (1) Make further loans under this part until it has entered into a 
new guarantee agreement with the Secretary; or
    (2) Enter into a new guarantee agreement with the Secretary until at 
least one year after the school's lending eligibility has been 
terminated under this section.
    (f) Schools under the same ownership. If a school makes loans to 
students or parents of students in attendance at other schools under the 
same ownership, the Secretary may make the determination required by 
this section by--
    (1) Treating all of the schools as one school; or
    (2) Treating each school on an individual basis.

<R05>
Sec. 682.609  Remedial actions.

    (a) The Secretary may require a school to repay funds paid to other 
program participants by the Secretary. The Secretary also may require a 
school to purchase from the holder of a FFEL loan that portion of the 
loan that is unenforceable, that the borrower was ineligible to receive, 
or for which the borrower was ineligible to receive interest benefits 
contrary to the school's certification, and to make arrangements 
acceptable to the Secretary for reimbursement of the amounts the 
Secretary will be obligated to pay to program participants respecting 
that loan in the future. The repayment of funds and purchase of loans 
may be required if the Secretary determines that the payment to program 
participants, the unenforceability of the loan, or the disbursement of 
loan amounts for which the borrower was ineligible or for which the 
borrower was ineligible for interest benefits, resulted in whole or in 
part from--
    (1) The school's violation of a Federal statute or regulation; or
    (2) The school's negligent or willful false certification.
    (b) In requiring a school to repay funds to the Secretary or to 
another party or to purchase loans from a holder in connection with an 
audit or program review, the Secretary follows the procedures described 
in 34 CFR part 668, subpart H.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may 
waive the right to require repayment of funds or repurchase of loans by 
a school if, in the Secretary's judgment, the best interest of the 
United States so requires.
    (d) The Secretary may impose a fine or take an emergency action 
against a school or limit, suspend, or terminate a school's 
participation in the FFEL programs, in accordance with 34 CFR part 668, 
subpart G.
    (e) A school shall comply with any emergency action, limitation, 
suspension, or termination imposed by a guaranty agency in accordance 
with the agency's standards and procedures. A school shall repay funds 
to the Secretary or other party or purchase loans from a holder if a 
guaranty agency determines that the school improperly received or 
retained the funds in violation of a Federal law or regulation or a 
guaranty agency rule or regulation.

[[Page 802]]

    (b) Loan record requirements. In addition to records required by 34

behalf of its students, a school must maintain--
    (1) A copy of the loan certification or data electronically 
submitted to the lender, that includes the amount of the loan and the 
period of enrollment for which the loan was intended;
    (2) The cost of attendance, estimated financial assistance, and 
estimated family contribution used to calculate the loan amount;
    (3) For loans delivered to the school by check, the date the school 
endorsed each loan check, if required;
    (4) The date or dates of delivery of the loan proceeds by the school 
to the student or to the parent borrower;
    (5) For loans delivered by electronic funds transfer or master 
check, a copy of the borrower's written authorization required under 
Sec. 682.604(c)(3), if applicable, to deliver the initial and subsequent 
disbursements of each FFEL program loan; and
    (6) Documentation of any MPN confirmation process or processes the 
school may have used.
    (c) Student status confirmation reports. A school shall--
    (1) Upon receipt of a student status confirmation report form from 
the Secretary or a similar student status confirmation report form from 
any guaranty agency, complete and return that report within 30 days of 
receipt to the Secretary or the guaranty agency, as appropriate; and
    (2) Unless it expects to submit its next student status confirmation 
report to the Secretary or the guaranty agency within the next 60 days, 
notify the guaranty agency or lender within 30 days--
    (i) If it discovers that a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan has been made 
to or on behalf of a student who enrolled at that school, but who has 
ceased to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis;
    (ii) If it discovers that a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan has been 
made to or on behalf of a student who has been accepted for enrollment 
at that school, but who failed to enroll on at least a half-time basis 
for the period for which the loan was intended;
    (iii) If it discovers that a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan has been 
made to or on behalf of a full-time student who has ceased to be 
enrolled on a full-time basis; or
    (iv) If it discovers that a student who is enrolled and who has 
received a Stafford or SLS loan has changed his or her permanent 
address.

third-party servicers that administer aspects of a lender's FFELP 
portfolio. These regulations also govern the Secretary's

violation of the prohibitions in section 435(d)(5) of the Act; or
    (ii) To a determination that an organization fails to meet the 
standards in Sec. 682.416;
    (2) To a school's loss of lending eligibility under Sec. 682.608; or

    (iv) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (relating to sex 
discrimination), which is governed by 34 CFR part 106.

new loans guaranteed by a guaranty agency after that date. The Secretary 
may also prohibit the lender from making further disbursements on a loan 
for which a guarantee commitment has already been issued.

Sec. 682.704  Emergency action.

    (a) The Secretary, or a designated Departmental official, may take 
emergency action to stop the issuance of guarantee commitments by the 
Secretary and guarantee agencies and to withhold payment of interest

servicer with which the lender contracts is in violation of applicable 
laws, regulations, special arrangements, agreements, or limitations 
entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of

    (2) Determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent the

following the procedures for limitation, suspension, or termination.
    (b) The Secretary begins an emergency action by notifying the lender 
or third-party servicer, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of 
the action and the basis for the action.

before the expiration of the 30-day period--
    (i) The emergency action may be extended until completion of the 
proceeding, including any appeal to the Secretary; and

Sec. 682.705  Suspension proceedings.

    (a) Scope. (1) A suspension by the Secretary removes a lender's 
eligibility under the FFEL programs or a third-party servicer's ability 
to enter into contracts with eligible lenders, and the Secretary does 
not guarantee or reinsure a new loan made by the lender or new loan 
serviced by the servicer during a period not to exceed 60 days from the 
date the suspension becomes effective, unless--
    (i) The lender or servicer and the Secretary agree to an extension 
of the suspension period, if the lender or third-party servicer has not 
requested a hearing; or
    (ii) The Secretary begins a limitation or a termination proceeding.
    (2) If the Secretary begins a limitation or a termination proceeding 
before the suspension period ends, the Secretary may extend the 
suspension period until the completion of that proceeding, including any 
appeal to the Secretary.
    (3) A suspension described in 34 CFR 85.201(c) lasts for a period of 
60 days, beginning on the effective date specified in the notice by the 
Secretary under 34 CFR 85.201(b), except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (b) Notice. (1) The Secretary, or a designated Departmental 
official, begins a suspension proceeding by sending the lender or 
servicer a notice by certified mail with return receipt requested.
    (2) The notice--
    (i) Informs the lender or servicer of the Secretary's intent to 
suspend the lender's or servicer's eligibility for a period not to 
exceed 60 days;
    (ii) Describes the consequences of a suspension;
    (iii) Identifies the alleged violations on which the proposed 
suspension is based;
    (iv) States the proposed date the suspension becomes effective, 
which is at least 20 days after the date of mailing of the notice;
    (v) Informs the lender or servicer that the suspension will not take 
effect on the proposed date, except as provided in paragraph (c)(9) of 
this section, if the Secretary receives at least five days prior to that 
date a request for an oral hearing or written material showing why the 
suspension should not take effect; and
    (vi) Asks the lender or servicer to correct voluntarily any alleged 
violations.
    (c) Hearing. (1) If the lender or servicer does not request an oral 
hearing but submits written material, the Secretary, or a designated 
Departmental official, considers the material and--
    (i) Dismisses the proposed suspension; or
    (ii) Determines that the proposed suspension should be implemented 
and notifies the lender or servicer of the effective date of the 
suspension.
    (2) If the lender or servicer requests an oral hearing within the 
time specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the Secretary 
schedules the date and place of the hearing. The date is at least 15 
days after receipt of the request from the lender or servicer. No 
proposed suspension takes effect until a hearing is held.
    (3) The oral hearing is conducted by a presiding officer who--
    (i) Ensures that a written record of the hearing is made;
    (ii) Considers relevant written material presented before the 
hearing and other relevant evidence presented during the hearing; and
    (iii) Issues a decision based on findings of fact and conclusions of 
law that may suspend the lender's or servicer's eligibility only if the 
presiding officer is persuaded that the suspension is warranted by the 
evidence.
    (4) The formal rules of evidence do not apply, and no discovery, as 
provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (28 U.S.C. Appendix) 
is required.

[[Page 806]]

    (5) The presiding officer shall base findings of fact only on 
evidence considered at or before the hearing and matters given official 
notice.
    (6) In a suspension action against a lender or third-party servicer 
based on a suspension under Executive Order 12549 or a proposed 
debarment under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, that does not meet the standards described in 34 CFR 
85.201(c), the presiding official finds that the suspension or proposed 
debarment constitutes prima facie evidence that cause for suspension 
under this subpart exists.
    (7) The initial decision of the presiding officer is mailed to the 
lender or servicer.
    (8) The Secretary automatically reviews the initial decision of the 
presiding officer. The Secretary notifies the lender or servicer of the 
Secretary's decision by mail.
    (9) A suspension takes effect on either a date that is at least 20 
days after the date the notice of a decision imposing the suspension is 
mailed to the lender or servicer, or on the proposed effective date 
stated in the notice sent under paragraph (b) of this section, whichever 
is later.

Sec. 682.706  Limitation or termination proceedings.

    (a) Notice. (1) The Secretary, or a designated Departmental 
official, begins a limitation or termination proceeding, whether a 
suspension proceeding has begun, by sending the lender or third-party 
servicer a notice by certified mail with return receipt requested.
    (2) The notice--
    (i) Informs the lender or servicer of the Secretary's intent to 
limit or terminate the lender's or servicer's eligibility;
    (ii) Describes the consequences of a limitation or termination;
    (iii) Identifies the alleged violations on which the proposed 
limitation or termination is based;
    (iv) States the limits which may be imposed, in the case of a 
limitation proceeding;
    (v) States the proposed date the limitation or termination becomes 
effective, which is at least 20 days after the date of mailing of the 
notice;
    (vi) Informs the lender or servicer that the limitation or 
termination will not take effect on the proposed date if the Secretary 
receives, at least five days prior to that date, a request for an oral 
hearing or written material showing why the limitation or termination 
should not take effect;
    (vii) Asks the lender or servicer to correct voluntarily any alleged 
violations; and
    (viii) Notifies the lender or servicer that the Secretary may 
collect any amount owed by means of offset against amounts owed to the 
lender by the Department and other Federal agencies.
    (b) Hearing. (1) If the lender or servicer does not request an oral 
hearing but submits written material, the Secretary, or a designated 
Departmental official, considers the material and--
    (i) Dismisses the proposed limitation or termination; or
    (ii) Notifies the lender or servicer of the date the limitation or 
termination becomes effective.
    (2) If the lender or servicer requests a hearing within the time 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section, the Secretary 
schedules the date and place of the hearing. The date is at least 15 
days after receipt of the request from the lender or servicer. No 
proposed limitation or termination takes effect until a hearing is held.
    (3) The hearing is conducted by a presiding officer who--
    (i) Ensures that a written record of the hearing is made;
    (ii) Considers relevant written material presented before the 
hearing and other relevant evidence presented during the hearing; and
    (iii) Issues an initial decision, based on findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, that may limit or terminate the lender's or 
servicer's eligibility if the presiding officer is persuaded that the 
limitation or termination is warranted by the evidence.

[[Page 807]]

    (4) The formal rules of evidence do not apply, and no discovery, as 
provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. appendix), 
is required.
    (5) The presiding officer shall base findings of fact only on 
evidence presented at or before the hearing and matters given official 
notice.
    (6) If a termination action is brought against a lender or third-
party servicer and the presiding officer concludes that a limitation is 
more appropriate, the presiding officer may issue a decision imposing 
one or more limitations on a lender or third-party servicer rather than 
terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility.
    (7) In a termination action against a lender or third-party servicer 
based on a debarment under Executive Order 12549 or under the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4 that does not 
meet the standards described in 34 CFR 85.201(c), the presiding official 
finds that the debarment constitutes prima facie evidence that cause for 
debarment and termination under this subpart exists.
    (8) The initial decision of the presiding officer is mailed to the 
lender or servicer.
    (9) Any time schedule specified in this section may be shortened 
with the approval of the presiding officer and the consent of the lender 
or servicer and the Secretary or designated Departmental official.
    (10) The presiding officer's initial decision automatically becomes 
the Secretary's final decision 20 days after it is issued and received 
by both parties unless the lender, servicer, or designated Departmental 
official appeals the decision to the Secretary within this period.
    (c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if a 
lender or a lender's owner or officer or third-party servicer or 
servicer's owner or officer, respectively, is convicted of or pled nolo 
contendere or guilty to a crime involving the unlawful acquisition, use, 
or expenditure of FFEL program funds, that conviction or guilty plea is 
grounds for terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility, 
respectively, to participate in the FFEL programs.

Sec. 682.707  Appeals in a limitation or termination proceeding.

    (a) If the lender, third-party servicer, or designated Departmental 
official appeals the initial decision of the presiding officer in

    (1) An appeal is made to the Secretary by submitting to the 
Secretary and the opposing party within 15 days of the date of the

the date it becomes effective would seriously and adversely affect the 
FFEL programs or student or parent borrowers.

violation of applicable laws, regulations, special arrangements, 
agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes 
applicable to Title IV of the HEA.
    (b) The corrective action may include payment to the Secretary or 
recipients designated by the Secretary of any funds, and any interest 
thereon, that the lender, or, in the case of a third-party servicer, the 
servicer or the lender that has a contract with a third-party servicer, 
improperly received, withheld, disbursed, or caused to be disbursed. A 
third-party servicer may be held liable up to the amounts specified in 
Sec. 682.413(a)(2).
    (c) If a final decision requires a lender, a lender that has a 
contract with a third-party servicer, or a third-party servicer to 
reimburse or make any payment to the Secretary, the Secretary may, 
without further notice or opportunity for a hearing, proceed to offset 
or arrange for another Federal agency to offset the amount due against 
any interest benefits, special allowance, or other payments due to the 
lender, the lender that has a contract with the third-party servicer, or 
the third-party servicer. A third-party servicer may be held liable up

Sec. 682.712  Disqualification review of limitation, suspension, and termination actions taken by guarantee agencies against lenders.

    (a) The Secretary reviews a limitation, suspension, or termination 
action taken by a guaranty agency against a lender participating in the 
FFEL programs to determine if national disqualification is appropriate. 
Upon completion of the Secretary's review, the Secretary notifies the 
guaranty agency and the lender of the Secretary's decision by mail.
    (b) The Secretary disqualifies a lender from participation in the 
FFEL programs if--
    (1) The lender waives review by the Secretary; or
    (2) The Secretary conducts the review and determines that the 
limitation, suspension, or termination was imposed in accordance with 
section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act.
    (c)(1) Disqualification by the Secretary continues until the 
Secretary is satisfied that--
    (i) The lender has corrected the failure that led to the limitation, 
suspension, or termination; and
    (ii) There are reasonable assurances that the lender will comply 
with the requirements of the FFEL programs in the future.
    (2) Revocation of disqualification by the Secretary does not remove 
any limitation, suspension, or termination imposed by the agency whose 
action resulted in the disqualification.
    (d) A guaranty agency shall refer a limitation, suspension, or 
termination action that it takes against a lender to the Secretary 
within 30 days of its final decision to limit, suspend, or terminate the 
lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program.
    (e) The Secretary reviews an agency's limitation, suspension, or 
termination of a lender's eligibility only when the guaranty agency's 
action is final, e.g, the lender is not entitled to any further appeals 
within the guaranty agency. A subsequent court challenge to an agency's 
action does not by itself affect the timing of the Secretary's review.
    (f) The guaranty agency's notice to the Secretary regarding a 
termination action must include a certified copy of the administrative 
record compiled by the agency with regard to the action. The record must 
include certified copies of the following documents:
    (1) The guaranty agency's letter initiating the action.
    (2) The lender's response.
    (3) The transcript of the agency's hearing.
    (4) The decision of the agency's hearing officer.
    (5) The decision of the agency on appeal from the hearing officer's 
decision, if any.
    (6) The regulations and written procedures of the agency under which 
the action was taken.
    (7) The audit or lender review report or documented basis that led 
to the action.
    (8) All other documents relevant to the action.
    (g) The guaranty agency's referral notice to the Secretary regarding 
a limitation or suspension action must include--
    (1) The documents described in paragraph (f) of this section; and

[[Page 810]]

    (2) Documents describing and substantiating the existence of one or 
more of the circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (h)(1) Within 60 days of the Secretary's receipt of a referral 
notice described in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, the Secretary 
makes an initial assessment, based on the agency's record, as to whether 
the agency's action appears to comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the 
Act.
    (2) In the case of a referral notice described in paragraph (g) of 
this section, the Secretary also determines whether one or more of the 
circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section exist.
    (3) If the Secretary concludes that the agency's action appears to 
comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act and, if applicable, one or 
more of the circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section 
exist, the Secretary notifies the lender that the Secretary will review 
the guaranty agency's action to determine whether to disqualify the 
lender from further participation in the FFEL programs and affords the 
lender an opportunity--
    (i) To waive the review and be disqualified immediately; or
    (ii) To request a review.
    (i) The Secretary's review of the guaranty agency's action is 
limited to whether the agency action was taken in accordance with 
procedures that were substantially the same as procedures applicable to 
the limitation, suspension, or termination of eligibility of a lender 
under the FISL Program (34 CFR part 682, subpart G).
    (j) In the case of an action by an agency that limits or suspends a 
lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program, the agency 
shall provide the Secretary with a referral as described in paragraph 
(g) of this section only if--
    (1) The lender has not corrected the violation. A violation is 
corrected if, among other things, the lender has satisfied fully all 
liabilities incurred by the lender as a result of the violation, 
including its liability to the Secretary, or the lender has arranged to 
satisfy those liabilities in a manner acceptable to the parties to whom 
the liabilities are owed;
    (2) The lender has not provided satisfactory assurances to the 
agency of future compliance with program requirements; or
    (3) The guaranty agency determines that special circumstances 
warrant disqualification of the lender from the FFEL programs for a 
significant period, notwithstanding the agency's decision not to 
terminate the lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's 
program.

section 428(b)(1)(T) of the Act.
    (c)(1) Disqualification by the Secretary continues until the 
Secretary is satisfied that--
    (i) The school has corrected the failure that led to the limitation, 
suspension, or termination; and
    (ii) There are reasonable assurances that the school will comply 
with the requirements of the FFEL programs in the future.
    (2) Revocation of disqualification by the Secretary does not remove 
any limitation, suspension, or termination imposed by the agency whose 
action resulted in the disqualification.
    (d) A guaranty agency shall refer a limitation, suspension, or 
termination

[[Page 811]]

action that it takes against a school to the Secretary within 30 days of 
its final decision to limit, suspend, or terminate the school's 
eligibility to participate in the agency's program.
    (e) The Secretary reviews an agency's limitation, suspension, or 
termination of a school's eligibility only when the guaranty agency's 
action is final, i.e., the institution is not entitled to any further 
appeals within the guaranty agency. A subsequent court challenge to an 
agency's action does not by itself affect the timing of the Secretary's 
review.
    (f) The guaranty agency's notice to the Secretary regarding a 
termination action must include a certified copy of the administrative 
record compiled by the agency with regard to the action. The record must 
include certified copies of the following documents:
    (1) The guaranty agency's letter initiating the action.
    (2) The school's response.
    (3) The transcript of the agency's hearing.
    (4) The decision of the agency's hearing officer.
    (5) The decision of the agency on appeal from the hearing officer's 
decision, if any.
    (6) The regulations and written procedures of the agency under which 
the action was taken.
    (7) The audit or program review report or documented basis that led 
to the action.
    (8) All other documents relevant to the action.
    (g) The guaranty agency's referral notice to the Secretary regarding 
a limitation or suspension action must include--
    (1) The documents described in paragraph (f) of this section; and
    (2) Documents describing and substantiating the existence of one or 
more of the circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (h)(1) Within 60 days of the Secretary's receipt of a referral 
notice described in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, the Secretary 
makes an initial assessment, based on the agency's record, as to whether 
the agency's action appears to comply with section 428(b)(1)(T) of the 
Act.
    (2) In the case of a referral notice described in paragraph (g) of 
this section, the Secretary also determines whether one or more of the 
circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section exist.
    (3) If the Secretary concludes that the agency's action appears to 
comply with section 428(b)(1)(T) of the Act, and, if applicable, one or 
more of the circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section 
exist, the Secretary notifies the school that the Secretary will review 
the guaranty agency's action to determine whether to disqualify the 
school from further participation in the FFEL programs and gives the 
school an opportunity within 30 days from the date the notice is mailed-
-
    (i) To waive the review and be disqualified immediately; or
    (ii) To request a review.
    (i) The Secretary's review of the guaranty agency's action is 
limited to--
    (1) A review of the written record of the agency's proceedings; and
    (2) Whether the agency action was taken in accordance with 
procedures that were substantially the same as procedures established by 
the Secretary in 34 CFR part 668, subpart G.
    (j) In the case of an action by an agency that limits or suspends a 
school's eligibility to participate in the agency's program, the agency 
shall provide the Secretary with a referral as described in paragraph 
(g) of this section only if--
    (1) The school has not corrected the violation. A violation is 
corrected if, among other things, the school has fully satisfied all 
liabilities incurred by the school as a result of the violation, 
including its liability to the Secretary, or the school has arranged to 
satisfy those liabilities in a manner acceptable to the parties to whom 
the liabilities are owed;
    (2) The school has not provided assurances satisfactory to the 
agency of future compliance with program requirements; or
    (3) The guaranty agency determines that special circumstances 
warrant disqualification of the school from the

[[Page 812]]

FFEL programs for a significant period, notwithstanding the agency's 
decision not to terminate the school's eligibility to participate in the 
agency's program.

  Appendix C to Part 682--Procedures for Curing Violations of the Due 
    Diligence in Collection and Timely Filing of Claims Requirements 
Applicable to FISLP and Federal PLUS Program Loans and for Repayment of 
      Interest and Special Allowance Overbillings [Bulletin L-77a]

    Note: The following is a reprint of Bulletin L-77a, issued on 
January 7, 1983, with minor modifications made to reflect changes in the 
program regulations since that date. All references to ``the date of 
this bulletin'' refer to that date. All references made to the Federal 
Insured Student Loan Program (FISLP) shall be understood to include the 
Federal PLUS Program. The bulletin includes references to the 120- and 
180-day default periods that used to apply to FFELP and PLUS Program 
loans. Public Law 99-272 established new default periods of 180 and 240 
days (as set out in 34 CFR 682.200 of these regulations) for all new 
loans and many existing ones. Although the discussion in this appendix C 
refers to the 120- and 180-day default periods, it is equally applicable 
to the new 180- and 240-day default periods.

                              Introduction

    This bulletin prescribes procedures for lenders to use (1) to cure 
violations of the requirements for due diligence in collection (``due 
diligence'') and timely filing of claims under the Federal Insured 
Student Loan Program (FISLP), and (2) to repay interest and special 
allowance overbillings made on loans evidencing such violations. See 34 
CFR 682.507, 682.511.\1\ These procedures allow for the reinstatement of 
a lender's eligibility for interest and special allowance and claim 
payments on loans evidencing such violations, under specified 
circumstances. These procedures apply to loans for which the first day 
of the 120-day or 180-day default period occurred on or after October 
21, 1979 (the effective date of the September 17, 1979 regulations), 
whether or not the loans have previously been submitted as claims to the 
Secretary.
    The due diligence and timely filing requirements governing the FISLP 
were established in response to requests from some lenders for more 
detailed regulatory guidance on the proper handling of FISLP loans.

[[Page 813]]

Despite the promulgation of these provisions, a number of lenders have 
failed to exercise the requisite care in their treatment of these loans, 
thereby increasing the risk of default thereon and, in many cases, 
prejudicing the Secretary's ability to collect from the borrowers. At 
the time the current due diligence and timely filing rules were issued, 
the Secretary anticipated that violations of these rules would be so 
infrequent as to permit requests for cures to be handled individually. 
However, the unexpectedly high incidence of violations of these rules 
has made continued case-by-case treatment of all cure requests 
administratively unmanageable. After carefully considering the views of 
lenders and other program participants, the Secretary has decided to 
exercise his authority under 20 U.S.C. 1082(a)(5), (6), and institute 
uniform procedures by which lenders with loans involving violations of 
the due diligence or timely filing requirements may cure these 
violations.

                              Due Diligence

    Collection activity is required to begin immediately upon 
delinquency by the borrower in honoring the repayment obligation. This 
holds true whether or not the borrower received a repayment schedule or 
signed a repayment agreement. Under 34 CFR 682.200, default on a FISLP 
loan occurs when a borrower fails to make a payment when due, provided 
this failure persists for 120 days for loans payable in monthly 
installments, or for 180 days for loans payable in less frequent 
installments. If, however, the lender has added the optional provision 
to the promissory note requiring the borrower to execute a repayment 
agreement not later than 120 days prior to the expiration of the grace 
period, the loan entered repayment prior to September 4, 1985 (see 50 FR 
35970), the lender sends the agreement to the borrower 150 days or more 
before the end of the grace period, and the agreement is not executed 
before the end of the grace period, default occurs at that time. One 
exception to this rule is as follows: If the holder of the loan is not 
the lender that made the loan, the holder may choose to forego 
enforcement of the optional 120-day provision in the note.
    The 120/180 day default period applies regardless of whether 
payments were missed consecutively or intermittently. For example, if 
the borrower, on a loan payable in monthly installments, makes his 
January 1st payment on time, his February 1st payment two months late 
(April 1st), his March 1st payment three months late (June 1st), and 
makes no further payments, the default period begins on February 1st, 
with the first delinquency, and ends on August 1st, when the April 1st 
payment becomes 120 days past due. The lender must treat the payment 
made on April 1st as the February 1st payment, since the February 1st 
payment had not been made prior to that time. Similarly, the lender must 
treat the payment made on June 1st as the March 1st payment, since the 
March payment had not been made prior to that time.
    Note: Lenders are strongly encouraged to exercise forbearance, prior 
to default, for the benefit of borrowers who have missed payments 
intermittently but have otherwise indicated willingness to repay their 
loans. See 34 CFR 682.211. The forebearance process helps to reduce the 
incidence of default, and serves to emphasize for the borrower the 
importance of compliance with the repayment obligation.

                              Timely Filing

    The 90-day filing period applicable to FISLP default claims is set 
forth in 34 CFR 682.511(e) (1) and (3). The 90-day filing period begins 
at the end of the 120/180 day default period. The lender must file a 
default claim on a loan in default by the end of the filing period, 
unless the borrower brings the account current before the end of the 
filing period. In such a case, the lender may choose not to file a claim 
on the loan at that time.
    In addition, for any loan less than 210 days delinquent on the date 
of this bulletin, the lender need not file a claim on that loan before 
the 210th day of delinquency (120-day default period plus 90-day filing 
period) if the borrower brings the account less than 120 days delinquent 
before such 210th day. Thus, in the above example, if the borrower makes 
the April 1st payment on August 2nd, the 90-day filing period continues 
to run from August 1st, unless the loan was less than 210 days 
delinquent on the date of this bulletin. If the loan was less than 210 
days delinquent on the date of this bulletin, then the August 2nd 
payment makes the loan 91 days delinquent, and the lender may, but need 
not file a default claim on the loan at that time. If, however, that 
loan again becomes 120 days delinquent, the lender must file a default 
claim within 90 days thereafter (unless the loan is again brought to 
less than 120 days delinquent prior to the end of that 90 day period). 
In other words, for any loan less than 210 days delinquent on the date 
of this bulletin, the Secretary will permit a lender to treat payments 
made during the filing period as ``curing'' the default if such payments 
are sufficient to make the loan less than 120 days delinquent.
    If a lender fails to comply with either the due diligence or timely 
filing requirements, the affected loan ceases to be insured; that is, 
the lender loses its right to receive interest benefits, special 
allowance and claim payments thereon. Some examples of violations of the 
due diligence requirements are set out in section I.C. below.

[[Page 814]]

                           I. Cure Procedures

                             A. Definitions

    The following definitions apply to terms used throughout Section I 
of this bulletin.
    Full payment means payment by the borrower, or another person (other 
than the lender) on the borrower's behalf, in an amount at least as 
great as the monthly payment amount required under the existing terms of 
the loan, exclusive of any forbearance agreement in force at the time of 
the default. (For example, if the original repayment schedule or 
agreement called for payments of $30 per month, but a forbearance 
agreement was in effect at the time of default that allowed the borrower 
to pay $15 per month for a specified time, and the borrower defaulted in 
making the reduced payments, a ``full payment'' would be $30, or two $15 
payments in accordance with original repayment schedule or agreement.)
    Reinstatement with respect to insurance coverage means the 
reinstatement of the lender's right to receive default, death, 
disability, or bankruptcy claim payments for the unpaid principal 
balance of the loan and for unpaid interest accruing on the loan after 
the date of reinstatement. Upon reinstatement of insurance, the borrower 
regains the right to receive forbearance or deferments, as appropriate. 
For purposes of this bulletin, ``reinstatement'' with respect to 
insurance on a loan does not include reinstatement of the lender's right 
to receive interest and special allowance payments on that loan. 
Reinstatement of the lender's right to receive interest and special 
allowance payments is addressed in section I.B.1, below.

                               B. General

    1. Resumption of Interest and Special Allowance Billing on Loans 
Involving Due Diligence or Timely Filing Violations. For any loan on 
which a cure is attempted under this bulletin, the lender may resume 
billing for interest and special allowance on the loan only for periods 
following the earlier of (1) its receipt of the equivalent of three full 
payments thereon, after the date of this bulletin or the date of the 
violation, whichever is later, or (2) receipt by the borrower of an 
authorized deferment, after reinstatement of insurance coverage.
    2. Reservation of the Secretary's Right to Strict Enforcement. While 
this bulletin allows cures to be attempted for particular violations in 
specified ways, the Secretary retains the option of refusing to permit 
or recognize cures in cases where, in the Secretary's judgment, a lender 
has committed an excessive number of severe violations of the due 
diligence or timely filing rules, and in cases where the best interests 
of the program otherwise require strict enforcement of these 
requirements. More generally, this bulletin states the Secretary's 
general policy and is not intended to limit in any way the authority and 
discretion afforded the Secretary by statute or regulations.
    3. Applicability of the Cure Procedures to Particular Classes of 
Loans. The cure procedures outlined in this bulletin apply only to a 
loan for which the first day of the 120/180 day default period that 
ended with default by the borrower occurred on or after October 21, 
1979, and which involve violations only of the due diligence and/or 
timely filing requirements.
    The cure procedures applicable to loans involving due diligence 
violations also apply to loans involving violations of both the timely 
filing and due diligence requirements.
    4. Excusal of Certain Due Diligence Violations. A lender whose claim 
was previously denied solely for violation of the timely filing rule, 
and who is permitted to cure that violation under the procedures set out 
in this bulletin, will not be required to utilize the procedures for 
curing due diligence violations, or to repay interest and special 
allowance improperly received from the Secretary as a result of a due 
diligence violation for periods prior to the timely filing violation. 
This applies even if, upon submission of the ``cured'' claim, the 
Secretary discovers that evidence of due diligence violations appeared 
in the file of the previously rejected claim.
    The Secretary will also excuse a due diligence violation by a lender 
if the account was brought current by the borrower (or another, other 
than the lender, on the borrower's behalf) prior to the 120th/180th day 
of the delinquency period during which the violation occurred.
    5. Treatment of Accrued Interest on ``Cured'' Claims--a. Due 
Diligence Violations. For any default claim involving ``cured'' 
violations of the due diligence rules, the Secretary will not reimburse 
the lender for any unpaid interest accruing after the first day of the 
120/180 day period that culminated in default, and prior to the date of 
reinstatement of insurance coverage.
    For any loan involving ``cured'' due diligence violations, the 
lender may capitalize unpaid interest accruing on the loan from the 
commencement of the 120/180 day default period to the date of the 
reinstatement of insurance coverage. See sections I.C. and D. below. 
However, if the lender later files a claim on that loan, the lender must 
deduct this capitalized interest from the amount of the claim. This 
deduction must be reflected in column 15 on the ED Form 1207, Lender's 
Application for Insurance Claim on Federal Insured Student Loan, filed 
with the claim evidencing the cure.
    b. Timely Filing Violations. For any default claim involving 
``cured'' violations of the

[[Page 815]]

timely filing rules, the Secretary will not reimburse the lender for 
unpaid interest accruing after the end of the 120/180 day default period 
that culminated in default, and prior to the date of reinstatement of 
insurance coverage.
    For any default claim involving a ``cured'' timely filing violation, 
if insurance coverage is later reinstated, the lender may capitalize 
unpaid interest accruing on the loan from the commencement of the 
original 120/180 day default period to the date of the reinstatement of 
insurance coverage. See sections I.C. and D. below. However, if the 
lender later files a claim, on that loan, the lender must deduct this 
capitalized interest from the amount of the claim, except that the 
lender need not deduct from the claim unpaid interest that accrued on 
the loan during the original 120/180 day default period. This deduction 
must be reflected in Column 15 of the ED Form 1207, Lender's Application 
for Insurance Claim on Federal Insured Student Loan, filed with the 
claim evidencing the cure.
    Some timely filing cures will not reinstate insurance coverage. For 
treatment of accrued interest in such cases, see Section I.D.1.c.
    6. Documents to be Submitted with ``Cured'' Claims. The Secretary 
requests that any lender submitting a claim on a loan involving 
``cured'' violations identify the claim as such with a note in the claim 
file stapled to the new ED Form 1207.
    For all ``cured'' claims, the lender must submit:
    <bullet> For loans on which a claim was previously rejected, all 
documents sent by the regional office with the original claim (when the 
claim was rejected and returned to the lender), including without 
limitation, the original ED Form 1207 and all documents showing the 
reason(s) for the original rejection;
    <bullet> All documents ordinarily required in connection with the 
submission of a default claim, including, without limitation, the 
promissory note, which must bear a valid assignment to the United States 
of America;
    <bullet> A new ED Form 1207; and
    <bullet> All documents showing that the lender has complied with the 
applicable cure procedures and requirements.

C. Cures for Violations of the Due Diligence in Collection Requirements 
                            (34 CFR 682.507)

    A violation of the due diligence in collection rules occurs when a 
lender fails to meet requirements found in 34 CFR 682.507. For example, 
a violation occurs if the lender fails to:
    <bullet> Remind the borrower of the date a missed payment was due 
within 15 days of delinquency;
    <bullet> Attempt to contact the borrower and any endorser at least 3 
times at regular intervals during the rest of the 120/180 day default 
period;
    <bullet> Request preclaims assistance from the Department of 
Education;
    <bullet> Request skip-tracing assistance from the Secretary, if 
required, or
    <bullet> Send a final demand letter to the borrower exercising the 
option to accelerate the due date for the outstanding balance of the 
loan, unless the lender does not know the borrower's address as of the 
90th day of delinquency.
    1. Reinstatement of Insurance Coverage. In the case of a due 
diligence violation, the lender may utilize either of the two procedures 
described below for obtaining reinstatement of insurance coverage on the 
loan. After the date of this bulletin, or after the date of the 
violation, whichever is later:
    (a) The lender obtains a new repayment agreement signed by the 
borrower which complies with the ten and fifteen year repayment 
limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7); or
    (b) The lender obtains 3 full payments. If the borrower later 
defaults, the lender must submit evidence of these payments (e.g., 
copies of the checks) with the claim.
    2. Borrower's Deemed Current As of Date of Cure. On the date the 
lender receives a signed copy of the new repayment agreement, or 
receives the third (curing) payment, insurance coverage on the loan is 
reinstated, and the borrower shall be deemed by the lender to be current 
in repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits available 
to FISLP borrowers. If the borrower later becomes delinquent in 
repayment, the lender shall follow the collection procedures set out in 
34 CFR 682.507, and the timely filing requirements set out in 34 CFR 
682.511.

   D. Cures for Violations of the Timely Filing Requirements (34 CFR 
                                682.511)

    1. Default Claims.--a. Reinstatement of Insurance Coverage. In order 
to obtain reinstatement of insurance coverage on a loan in the case of a 
timely filing violation, the lender must first locate the borrower after 
the date of this bulletin, or after the date of the violation, whichever 
is later (see section I.D.1.d. for description of acceptable evidence of 
location). Then, the lender must send to the borrower, at the address at 
which the borrower was located, (i) a new repayment agreement, to be 
signed by the borrower, which complies with the ten and fifteen year 
repayment limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7), along with (ii) a 
collection letter indicating in strong terms the seriousness of the 
borrower's delinquency and its potential effect on his or her credit 
rating if repayment is not commenced or resumed.
    If, within 30 days after the lender sends these items, the borrower 
fails to make a full payment or to sign and return the new repayment 
agreement, the lender shall, within

[[Page 816]]

5 working days thereafter, send the borrower a copy of the attached ``48 
hour'' collection letter, on the lender's letterhead. (See attachment 
A.)
    b. Borrower Deemed Current Under Certain Circumstances. If, within 
45 days after the lender sends the new repayment agreement to the 
borrower for signature, the borrower makes a full payment or signs and 
returns the new repayment agreement, insurance coverage on the loan is 
reinstated. The borrower shall be deemed by the lender to be current in 
repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits available to 
FISLP borrowers. If the borrower later becomes delinquent in repayment, 
the lender shall follow the collection steps in 34 CFR 682.507 and the 
timely filing requirements in 34 CFR 682.511.
    c. Borrower Deemed in Default Under Certain Circumstances. If the 
borrower does not make a full payment, or sign and return the new 
repayment agreement, within 45 days after the lender sends the new 
repayment agreement, the lender shall deem the borrower to be in 
default. The lender shall then file a default claim on the loan 
accompanied by acceptable evidence of location (see I.D.I.d below), 
within 30 days after the end of such 45-day period. Although insurance 
coverage is not reinstated on loans involving these circumstances, the 
Secretary will honor default claims submitted in accordance with this 
paragraph on the outstanding principal balance of such loans, and on 
unpaid interest accruing on the loan during the 120/180 day default 
period.
    d. Acceptable Evidence of Location. Only the following documentation 
is acceptable as evidence that the lender has located the borrower:
    (i) Postal receipt signed by the borrower not more than 25 days 
prior to the date on which the lender sent the new repayment agreement, 
indicating acceptance of correspondence from the lender by the borrower 
at the address shown on the receipt; or
    (ii) A completed ``Certification of Borrower Location'' form 
(Attachment B).
    2. Death, Disability, and Bankruptcy Claims. Lenders may immediately 
resubmit any death or disability claim which was rejected solely for 
failure to meet the 60 day timely filing requirements (see 34 CFR 
685.511(e)(2)). However, the Secretary will not pay any such claim if, 
before the date the lender determined that the borrower died or was 
totally and permanently disabled, the lender had violated the due 
diligence or timely filing requirements applicable to default claims 
with respect to that loan. Interest that accrued on the loan after the 
expiration of the 60-day filing period remains uninsured by the 
Secretary, and the lender must repay all interest and special allowance 
received on the loan for periods after the expiration of the 60-day 
filing period.
    The Secretary has determined that, in the vast majority of cases, 
the failure of a lender to comply with the timely filing requirement 
applicable to bankruptcy claims causes irreparable harm to the 
Secretary's ability to contest the discharge of the loan by the court, 
or to otherwise collect from the borrower. Therefore, the Secretary has 
decided not to permit cures for violations of the timely filing 
requirement applicable to bankruptcy claims, except when the lender can 
demonstrate that the bankruptcy action has concluded and that the loan 
has not been discharged in bankruptcy. In that case, the lender shall 
treat the loan as in default. The Secretary will honor a default claim 
later filed on such a loan only if the lender has met the cure 
requirements in section I.C. above for due diligence violations.

  II. Repayment of Interest and Special Allowance on Loans Evidencing 
      Violations of the Due Diligence or Timely Filing Requirements

                             A. General Rule

    It has always been the Secretary's interpretation of the FISLP 
statute and regulations that a lender's right to receive interest and 
special allowance payments on a FISLP loan terminates immediately 
following the lender's violation of the due diligence or timely filing 
requirements. This applies whether or not the lender has filed a claim 
on the loan. In other words, lenders may receive interest and special 
allowance only on loans which are insured by the Secretary. Since these 
violations result in the termination of insurance, they also result in 
the termination of FISLP benefits.

   B. Cessation of Billing on Loans Evidencing Violations of the Due 
                 Diligence or Timely Filing Requirements

    Any lender currently billing the Secretary for interest and special 
allowance on a loan that the lender knows involves a due diligence or 
timely filing violation must cease doing so immediately. However, 
lenders are not required at this time to review their loan portfolios 
for due diligence and timely filing violations.

C. Determination of Amounts of Interest and Special Allowance That Must 
                                Be Repaid

    1. Due Diligence Violations. In the case of due diligence 
violations, it is often difficult to ascertain the precise date on which 
a violation occurred. For the administrative ease of the Secretary and 
lenders, the Secretary has decided to waive his right to recoup interest 
and special allowance payments made to a lender for periods between the 
date of a due diligence violation and the end of the

[[Page 817]]

120/180 day default period. However, any lender that has received 
interest or special allowance payments from the Secretary for periods 
after the end of the 120/180 day default period on a loan that the 
lender knows involves a due diligence violation must promptly repay 
those amounts.
    2. Timely Filing Violations. In the case of timely filing 
violations, the lender loses its right to receive interest and special 
allowance payments as of the expiration of the applicable timely filing 
period. Therefore, any lender that has received interest or special 
allowance payments from the Secretary for periods following the end of 
the applicable timely filing period on a loan that the lender knows 
involves a timely filing violation must repay those amounts.
    3. Situations in Which a Lender May Have Received Interest Benefits 
for Periods During Which a Loan was Uninsured. Because most due 
diligence violations, and timely filing violations, occur after 
termination of the grace period, interest payments are ordinarily not 
affected by such violations. However, there are three types of 
situations in which a lender may have received interest payments from 
the Secretary to which it was not entitled due to a due diligence or 
timely filing violation.
    a. Promissory notes that include a requirement that the borrower 
sign a repayment agreement no later than 120 days prior to the 
expiration of the grace period. In such cases, a due diligence violation 
may occur during the grace period, when the lender may otherwise have 
been eligible to receive interest benefits. However, the lender need not 
repay that interest to the Secretary. See II.C.1. above.
    b. Deferment Periods. A due diligence violation may occur prior to a 
deferment period when the lender would otherwise have been eligible to 
receive interest benefits.
    c. Loans Made Prior to December 15, 1968. A loan disbursed prior to 
December 15, 1968, and which qualified for payment of Federal interest 
benefits at the time the loan was disbursed, qualifies for payment of a 
3 percent interest subsidy on the unpaid principal balance during the 
entire repayment period, provided the loan remains insured. In the case 
of such a loan, a due diligence or timely filing violation terminates 
the lender's eligibility for the 3 percent payments.

  D. Procedures for Repayment of Federal Interest Benefits and Special 
   Allowance Received by a Lender for Periods During Which a Loan Was 
                                Uninsured

    A lender must make the repayments of interest and/or special 
allowance discussed in II.C. above, by way of an adjustment during the 
two quarters immediately following the discovery of the violation. These 
adjustments must be reported on the normal Lender`s Interest and Special 
Allowance Request and Report (ED Form 799). Lenders are requested not to 
send a check with the adjustment; the overpaid amount will be deducted 
by the Secretary from the lender's next regular interest and special 
allowance payment. For five years after any loan for which an adjustment 
is made is repaid in full, the lender shall retain a record of the basis 
for the adjustment showing the amount(s) of the overbilling(s), and the 
date it used for cessation of interest or special allowance eligibility 
in calculating the overbilled amount. See 34 CFR 682.515(a)(2).

  Appendix D to Part 682--Policy for Waiving the Secretary's Right To 
   Recover or Refuse To Pay Interest Benefits, Special Allowance, and 
  Reinsurance on Stafford, Plus, Supplemental Loans for Students, and 
  Consolidation Program Loans Involving Lenders' Violations of Federal 
 Regulations Pertaining to Due Diligence in Collection or Timely Filing 
                      of Claims [Bulletin 88-G-138]

    Note: The following is a reprint of Bulletin 88-G-138, issued on 
March 11, 1988, with modifications made to reflect changes in the 
program regulations. For a loan that has lost reinsurance prior to 
December 1, 1992, this policy applies only through November 30, 1995. 
For a loan that loses reinsurance on or after December 1, 1992, this 
policy applies until 3 years after the default claim filing deadline. 
For the purpose of determining the 3-year deadline, reinsurance is lost 
on the later of (a) 3 years from the last date the claim could have been 
filed for claim payment with the guaranty agency for a claim that was 
not filed; or (b) 3 years from the date the guaranty agency rejected the 
claim, for a claim that was filed. These deadlines are extended by 
periods during which collection activities are suspended due to the 
filing of a bankruptcy petition.

                              Introduction

    (1) This letter sets forth the circumstances under which the 
Secretary, pursuant to sections 432(a)(5) and (6) of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 and 34 CFR 682.406(b) and 682.413(f), will waive 
certain of the Secretary's rights and claims with respect to Stafford 
Loans, PLUS, Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), and Consolidation 
Program loans made under a guaranty agency program that involve 
violations of Federal regulations pertaining to due diligence in 
collection or timely filing. (These programs are collectively referred 
to in this letter as the FFEL Program.) This policy applies to due 
diligence violations on loans for which the first day of delinquency 
occurred on or after March 10, 1987 (the effective date of the November 
10, 1986 due diligence regulations) and to timely filing violations 
occurring on or after December 26, 1986, whether or not the affected 
loans have been submitted as claims to the guaranty agency.
    (2) The Secretary has been implementing a variety of regulatory and 
administrative actions to minimize defaults in the FFEL Program. As a 
part of this effort, the Secretary published final regulations on 
November 10, 1986, requiring lenders and guaranty agencies to undertake 
specific due diligence activities to collect delinquent and defaulted 
loans, and establishing deadlines for the filing of claims by lenders 
with guaranty agencies. In recognition of the time required for agencies 
and lenders to modify their internal procedures, the Secretary delayed 
for four months the date by which lenders were required to comply with 
the new due diligence requirements. Thus, Sec. 682.411 of the 
regulations, which established minimum due diligence procedures that a 
lender must follow in order for a guaranty agency to receive reinsurance 
on a loan, became effective for loans for which the first day of 
delinquency occurred on or after March 10, 1987. The regulations make 
clear that compliance with these minimum requirements, and with the new 
timely filing deadlines, is a condition for an agency's receiving or 
retaining reinsurance payments made by the Secretary on a loan. See 34 
CFR 682.406(a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), and 682.413(b). The regulations also 
specify that a lender must comply with Sec. 682.411 and with the 
applicable filing deadline as a condition for its right to receive or 
retain interest benefits and special allowance on a loan for certain 
periods. See 34 CFR 682.300(b)(2)(vii), 682.302(d)(1)(iv), 
682.413(a)(1).
    (3) The Department has received inquiries regarding the procedures 
by which a lender may cure a violation of Sec. 682.411 regarding 
diligent loan collection, or of the 90-day deadline for the filing of 
default claims found in Sec. 682.406(a)(3) and (a)(5), in order to 
reinstate the agency's right to reinsurance and the lender's right to 
interest benefits and special allowance. Preliminarily, please note 
that, absent an exercise of the Secretary's waiver authority, a guaranty 
agency may not receive or retain reinsurance payments on a loan on which 
the lender has violated the Federal due diligence or timely filing 
requirements, even if the lender has followed a cure procedure 
established by the agency. Under Secs. 682.406(b) and 682.413(f), the 
Secretary--not the guaranty agency--decides whether to reinstate 
reinsurance coverage on a loan involving such a violation or any other 
violation of Federal regulations. A lender's violation of a guaranty 
agency's requirement that affects the agency's guarantee coverage also 
affects reinsurance coverage. See Secs. 682.406(a)(7) and 682.413(b). As 
Secs. 682.406(a)(7) and 682.413(b) make clear, a guaranty agency's cure 
procedures are relevant to reinsurance coverage only insofar as they 
allow for cure of violations of requirements established by the agency 
affecting the loan insurance it provides to lenders. In addition, all 
those requirements must be submitted to the Secretary for review and 
approval under 34 CFR 682.401(d).

[[Page 820]]

    (4) References throughout this letter to ``due diligence and timely 
filing'' rules, requirements, and violations should be understood to 
mean only the Federal rules cited above, unless the context clearly 
requires otherwise.

                                A. Scope

    This letter outlines the Secretary's waiver policy regarding certain 
violations of Federal due diligence or timely filing requirements on a 
loan insured by a guaranty agency. Unless your agency receives 
notification to the contrary, or the lender's violation involves fraud 
or other intentional misconduct, you may treat as reinsured any 
otherwise reinsured loan involving such a violation that has been cured 
in accordance with this letter.

          B. Duty of a Guaranty Agency To Enforce Its Standards

    As noted above, a lender's violation of a guaranty agency's 
requirement that affects the agency's guarantee coverage also affects 
reinsurance coverage. Thus, as a general rule, an agency that fails to 
enforce such a requirement and pays a default claim involving a 
violation is not eligible to receive reinsurance on the underlying loan. 
However, in light of the waiver policy outlined below, which provides 
more stringent cure procedures for violations occurring on or after May 
1, 1988 than for pre-May 1, 1988 violations, some guaranty agencies with 
more stringent policies than the policy outlined below for the pre-May 1 
violations have indicated that they wish to relax their own policies for 
violations of agency rules during that period. While the Secretary does 
not encourage any agency to do so, the Secretary will permit an agency 
to take either of the following approaches to its enforcement of its own 
due diligence and timely filing rules for violations occurring before 
May 1, 1988.
    (1) The agency may continue to enforce its rules, even if they 
result in the denial of guarantee coverage by the agency on otherwise 
reinsurable loans; or
    (2) The agency may decline to enforce its rules as to any loan that 
would be reinsured under the retrospective waiver policy outlined below. 
In other words, for violations of a guaranty agency's due diligence and 
timely filing rules occurring before May 1, 1988, a guaranty agency is 
authorized, but not required, to retroactively revise its own due 
diligence and timely filing standards to treat as guaranteed any loan 
amount that is reinsured under the retrospective enforcement policy 
outlined in section I.C.1. However, for any violation of an agency's due 
diligence or timely filing rules occurring on or after May 1, 1988, the 
agency must resume enforcing those rules in accordance with their terms, 
in order to receive reinsurance payments on the underlying loan. For 
these post-April 30 violations, and for any other violation of an 
agency's rule affecting its guarantee coverage, the Secretary will treat 
as reinsured all loans on which the agency has engaged in, and 
documented, a case-by-case exercise of reasonable discretion allowing 
for guarantee coverage to be continued or reinstated notwithstanding the 
violation. But any agency that otherwise fails, or refuses, to enforce 
such a rule does so without the benefit of reinsurance coverage on the 
affected loans, and the lenders continue to be ineligible for interest 
benefits and special allowance thereon.

                            C. Due Diligence

    Under 34 CFR 682.200, default on a FFEL Program loan occurs when a 
borrower fails to make a payment when due, provided this failure 
persists for 270 days for loans payable in monthly installments, or for 
330 days for loans payable in less frequent installments. The 270/330-
day default period applies regardless of whether payments were missed 
consecutively or intermittently. For example, if the borrower, on a loan 
payable in monthly installments, makes his January 1st payment on time, 
his February 1st payment two months late (April 1st), his March 1st 
payment 3 months late (June 1st), and makes no further payments, the 
delinquency period begins on February 2nd, with the first delinquency, 
and default occurs on December 27th, when the April payment becomes 270 
days past due. The lender must treat the payment made on April 1st as 
the February 1st payment, since the February 1st payment had not been 
made prior to that time. Similarly, the lender must treat the payment 
made on June 1st as the March 1st payment, since the March payment had 
not been made prior to that time.

    Note: Lenders are strongly encouraged to exercise forbearance, prior 
to default, for the benefit of borrowers who have missed payments 
intermittently but have otherwise indicated willingness to repay their 
loans. See 34 CFR 682.211. The forbearance process helps to reduce the 
incidence of default, and serves to emphasize for the borrower the 
importance of compliance with the repayment obligation.

                            D. Timely Filing

    (1) The 90-day filing period applicable to FFEL Program default 
claims is described in 34 CFR 682.406(a)(5). The 90-day filing period 
begins at the end of the 270/330-day default period. The lender 
ordinarily must file a default claim on a loan in default by the end of 
the filing period. However, the lender may, but need not, file a claim 
on that loan before the 360th day of delinquency (270-day default period 
plus 90-day filing period) if the borrower brings the account less than 
270 days

[[Page 821]]

delinquent before the 360th day. Thus, in the above example, if the 
borrower makes the April 1st payment on December 28th, that payment 
makes the loan 241 days delinquent, and the lender may, but need not, 
file a default claim on the loan at that time. If, however, the loan 
again becomes 270 days delinquent, the lender must file a default claim 
within 90 days thereafter (unless the loan is again brought to less than 
270 days delinquent prior to the end of that 90-day period). In other 
words, the Secretary will permit a lender to treat payments made during 
the filing period as curing the default if those payments are sufficient 
to make the loan less than 270 days delinquent.
    (2) Section I of this letter outlines the Secretary's waiver policy 
for due diligence and timely filing violations. As noted above, to the 
extent that it results in the imposition of a lesser sanction than that 
available to the Secretary by statute or regulation, this policy 
reflects the exercise of the Secretary's authority to waive the 
Secretary's rights and claims in this area. Section II discusses the 
issue of the due date of the first payment on a loan and the application 
of the waiver policy to that issue. Section III provides guidance on 
several issues related to due diligence and timely filing as to which 
clarification has been requested by some program participants.

                            I. Waiver Policy

                             A. Definitions

    The following definitions apply to terms used throughout this 
letter:
    Full payment means payment by the borrower, or another person (other 
than the lender) on the borrower's behalf, in an amount at least as 
great as the monthly payment amount required under the existing terms of 
the loan, exclusive of any forbearance agreement in force at the time of 
the default. (For example, if the original repayment schedule or 
agreement called for payments of $50 per month, but a forbearance 
agreement was in effect at the time of default that allowed the borrower 
to pay $25 per month for a specified time, and the borrower defaulted in 
making the reduced payments, a full payment would be $50, or two $25 
payments in accordance with the original repayment schedule or 
agreement.) In the case of a payment made by cash, money order, or other 
means that do not identify the payor that is received by a lender after 
the date of this letter, that payment may constitute a full payment only 
if a senior officer of the lender or servicing agent certifies that the 
payment was not made by or on behalf of the lender or servicing agent.
    Earliest unexcused violation means:
    (a) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to a failure to timely 
establish a first payment due date, the earliest unexcused violation 
would be the 46th day after the date the first payment due date should 
have been established.
    (b) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to a gap of 46 days, the 
earliest unexcused violation date would be the 46th day following the 
last collection activity.
    (c) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to three or more due 
diligence violations of 6 days or more, the earliest unexcused violation 
would be the day after the date of default.
    (d) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to a timely filing 
violation, the earliest unexcused violation would be the day after the 
filing deadline.
    Reinstatement with respect to reinsurance coverage means the 
reinstatement of the guaranty agency's right to receive reinsurance 
payments on the loan after the date of reinstatement. Upon reinstatement 
of reinsurance, the borrower regains the right to receive forbearance or 
deferments, as appropriate. Reinstatement with respect to reinsurance on 
a loan also includes reinstatement of the lender's right to receive 
interest and special allowance payments on that loan.
    Gap in collection activity on a loan means:
    (a) The period between the initial delinquency and the first 
collection activity;
    (b) The period between collection activities (a request for 
preclaims assistance is considered a collection activity);
    (c) The period between the last collection activity and default; or
    (d) The period between the date a lender discovers a borrower has 
``skipped'' and the lender's first skip-tracing activity.

    Note: The concept of ``gap'' is used herein simply as one measure of 
collection activity. This definition applies to loans subject to the 
FFEL and PLUS programs regulations published on or after November 10, 
1986. For those loans, not all gaps are violations of the due diligence 
rules.

    Violation with respect to the due diligence requirements in 
Sec. 682.411 means the failure to timely complete a required diligent 
phone contact effort, the failure to timely send a required letter 
(including a request for preclaims assistance), or the failure to timely 
engage in a required skip-tracing activity. If during the delinquency 
period a gap of more than 45 days occurs (more than 60 days for loans 
with a transfer), the lender must satisfy the requirement outlined in 
I.D.1. for reinsurance to be reinstated. The day after the 45-day gap 
(or 60 for loans with a transfer) will be considered the date that the 
violation occurred.
    Transfer means any action, including, but not limited to, the sale 
of the loan, that results in a change in the system used to monitor or 
conduct collection activity on a loan from one system to another.

[[Page 822]]

    B. General
    1. Resumption of Interest and Special Allowance Billing on Loans 
Involving Due Diligence or Timely Filing Violations. For any loan on 
which a cure is required under this letter in order for the agency to 
receive any reinsurance payment, the lender may resume billing for 
interest and special allowance on the loan only for periods following 
its completion of the required cure procedure.
    2. Reservation of the Secretary's Right to Strict Enforcement. While 
this letter describes the Secretary's general waiver policy, the 
Secretary retains the option of refusing to permit or recognize cures, 
or of insisting on strict enforcement of the remedies established by 
statute or regulation, in cases where, in the Secretary's judgment, a 
lender has committed an excessive number of severe violations of due 
diligence or timely filing rules and in cases where the best interests 
of the United States otherwise require strict enforcement. More 
generally, this bulletin states the Secretary's general policy and is 
not intended to limit in any way the authority and discretion afforded 
the Secretary by statute or regulation.
    3. Interest, Special Allowance, and Reinsurance Repayment Required 
as a Condition for Exercise of the Secretary's Waiver Authority. The 
Secretary's waiver of the right to recover or refuse to pay reinsurance, 
interest benefits, or special allowance payments, and recognition of 
cures for due diligence and timely filing violations, are conditioned on 
the following:
    a. The guaranty agency and lender must ensure that the lender repays 
all interest benefits and special allowance received on loans involving 
violations occurring prior to May 1, 1988, for which the lender is 
ineligible under the waiver policy for the ``retrospective period'' 
described in section I.C.1., or under the waiver policy for timely 
filing violations described in section I.E.1., by an adjustment to one 
of the next three quarterly billings for interest benefits and special 
allowance submitted by the lender in a timely manner after May 1, 1988. 
The guaranty agency's responsibility in this regard is satisfied by 
receipt of a certification from the lender that this repayment has been 
made in full.
    b. The guaranty agency, on or before October 1, 1988, must repay all 
reinsurance received on loans involving violations occurring prior to 
May 1, 1988, for which the agency is ineligible under the waiver policy 
for the ``retrospective period'' described in section I.C.1., or under 
the waiver policy for timely filing violations described in section 
I.E.1. Pending completion of the repayment described above, a lender or 
guaranty agency may submit billings to the Secretary on loans that are 
eligible for reinsurance under the waiver policy in this letter until it 
learns that repayment in full will not be made, or until the deadline 
for a repayment has passed without it being made, whichever is earlier. 
Of course, a lender or guaranty agency is prohibited from billing the 
Secretary for program payments on any loan amount that is not eligible 
for reinsurance under the waiver policy outlined in this letter. In 
addition to the repayments required above, any amounts received in the 
future in violation of this prohibition must immediately be repaid to 
the Secretary.
    4. Applicability of the Waiver Policy to Particular Classes of 
Loans. The policy outlined in this letter applies only to a loan for 
which the first day of the 180/240-day or 270/330-day default period (as 
applicable) that ended with default by the borrower occurred on or after 
March 10, 1987, or, in the case of a timely filing violation, December 
26, 1986, and that involves violations only of the due diligence or 
timely filing requirements or both. For a loan that has lost reinsurance 
prior to December 1, 1992, this policy applies only through November 30, 
1995. For a loan that loses reinsurance on or after December 1, 1992, 
this policy applies until 3 years after the default claim filing 
deadline.
    5. Excuse of Certain Due Diligence Violations. Except as noted in 
section II, if a loan has due diligence violations but was later cured 
and brought current, those violations will not be considered in 
determining whether a loan was serviced in accordance with 34 CFR 
682.411. Guarantors must review the due diligence for the 180/240 or 
270/330-day period (as applicable) prior to the default date ensuring 
the due date of the first payment not later made is the correct payment 
due date for the borrower.
    6. Excuse of Timely Filing Violations Due to Performance of a 
Guaranty Agency's Cure Procedures. If, prior to May 1, 1988, and prior 
to the filing deadline, a lender commenced the performance of collection 
activities specifically required by the guaranty agency to cure a due 
diligence violation on a loan, the Secretary will excuse the lender's 
timely filing violation if the lender completes the additional 
activities within the time period permitted by the guaranty agency and 
files a default claim on the loan not more than 45 days after completing 
the additional activities.
    7. Treatment of Accrued Interest on ``Cured'' Claims. For any loan 
involving any violation of the due diligence or timely filing rules for 
which a ``cure'' is required under section I.C. or I.E., for the agency 
to receive a reinsurance payment, the Secretary will not reimburse the 
guaranty agency for any unpaid interest accruing after the date of the 
earliest unexcused violation occurring after the last payment received 
before the cure is accomplished, and prior to the date of reinstatement 
of reinsurance coverage. The lender may capitalize unpaid interest 
accruing on

[[Page 823]]

the loan from the date of the earliest unexcused violation to the date 
of the reinstatement of reinsurance coverage. However, if the agency 
later files a claim for reinsurance on that loan, the agency must deduct 
this capitalized interest from the amount of the claim. Some cures will 
not reinstate coverage. For treatment of accrued interest in those 
cases, see section I.E.1.c.
    C. Waiver Policy for Violations of the Federal Due Diligence in 
Collection Requirements (34 CFR 682.411)
    A violation of the due diligence in collection rules occurs when a 
lender fails to meet the requirements found in 34 CFR 682.411. However, 
if a lender makes all required calls and sends all required letters 
during any of the delinquency periods described in that section, the 
lender is considered to be in compliance with that section for that 
period, even if the letters were sent before the calls were made. The 
special provisions for transfers apply whenever the violation(s) and, if 
applicable, the gap, were due to a transfer, as defined in section I.A.
    1. Retrospective Period. For one or more due diligence violations 
occurring during the period March 10, 1987-April 30, 1988--
    a. There will be no reduction or recovery by the Secretary of 
payments to the lender or guaranty agency if no gap of 46 days or more 
(61 days or more for a transfer) exists.
    b. If a gap of 46-60 days (61-75 days for a transfer) exists, 
principal will be reinsured, but accrued interest, interest benefits, 
and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the 
delinquency period are limited to amounts accruing through the date of 
default.
    c. If a gap of 61 days or more (76 days or more for a transfer) 
exists, the borrower must be located after the gap, either by the agency 
or the lender, in order for reinsurance on the loan to be reinstated. 
(See section I.E.1.d., for a description of acceptable evidence of 
location.) In addition, if the loan is held by the lender or after March 
15, 1988, the lender must follow the steps described in section I.E.1., 
or receive a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement, in order 
for the loan to again be eligible for reinsurance. The lender must repay 
all interest benefits and special allowance received for the period 
beginning with its earliest unexcused violation, occurring after the 
last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and ending with 
the date, if any, that reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.
    2. Prospective Period. For due diligence violations occurring on or 
after May 1, 1988 based on due dates prior to October 6, 1998--
    a. There will be no reduction or recovery by the Secretary of 
payments to the lender or guaranty agency if there is no violation of 
Federal requirements of 6 days or more (21 days or more for a transfer.)
    b. If there exist not more than two violations of 6 days or more 
each (21 days or more for a transfer), and no gap of 46 days or more (61 
days or more for a transfer) exists, principal will be reinsured, but 
accrued interest, interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise 
payable by the Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to 
amounts accruing through the date of default. However, the lender must 
complete all required activities before the claim filing deadline, 
except that a preclaims assistance request must be made before the 240th 
day of delinquency. If the lender fails to make this request by the 
240th day, the Secretary will not pay any accrued interest, interest 
benefits, and special allowance for the most recent 180 days prior to 
default. If the lender fails to complete any other required activity 
before the claim filing deadline, accrued interest, interest benefits, 
and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the 
delinquency period will be limited to amounts accruing through the 90th 
day before default.
    c. If there exist three violations of 6 days or more each (21 days 
or more for a transfer) and no gap of 46 days or more (61 days or more 
for a transfer), the lender must satisfy the requirements outlined in 
I.E.1., or receive a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement in 
order for reinsurance on the loan to be reinstated. The Secretary does 
not pay any interest benefits or special allowance for the period 
beginning with the lender's earliest unexcused violation occurring after 
the last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and ending 
with the date, if any, that reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.
    d. If there exist more than three violations of 6 days or more each 
(21 days or more for a transfer) of any type, or a gap of 46 days (61 
days for a transfer) or more and at least one violation, the lender must 
satisfy the requirement outlined in section I.D.1., for reinsurance on 
the loan to be reinstated. The Secretary does not pay any interest 
benefits or special allowance for the period beginning with the lender's 
earliest unexcused violation occurring after the last payment received 
before the cure is accomplished, and ending with the date, if any, that 
reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.
    3. Post 1998 Amendments. For due diligence violations based on due 
dates on or after October 6, 1998--
    a. There will be no reduction or recovery by the Secretary of 
payments to the lender or guaranty agency if there is no violation of 
Federal requirements of 6 days or more (21 days or more for a transfer).
    b. If there exist not more than two violations of 6 days or more 
each (21 days or more for a transfer), and no gap of 46 days or more (61 
days or more for a transfer) exists, principal will be reinsured, but 
accrued interest,

[[Page 824]]

interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by the 
Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to amounts accruing 
through the date of default. However, the lender must complete all 
required activities before the claim filing deadline, except that a 
default aversion assistance request must be made before the 330th day of 
delinquency. If the lender fails to make this request by the 330th day, 
the Secretary will not pay any accrued interest, interest benefits, and 
special allowance for the most recent 270 days prior to default. If the 
lender fails to complete any other required activity before the claim 
filing deadline, accrued interest, interest benefits, and special 
allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the delinquency period 
will be limited to amounts accruing through the 90th day before default.
    c. If there exist three violations of 6 days or more each (21 days 
or more for a transfer) and no gap of 46 days or more (61 days or more 
for a transfer), the lender must satisfy the requirements outlined in 
I.E.1. or receive a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement in 
order for reinsurance on the loan to be reinstated. The Secretary does 
not pay any interest benefits or special allowance for the period 
beginning with the lender's earliest unexcused violation occurring after 
the last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and ending 
with the date, if any, that reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.
    d. If there exist more than three violations of 6 days or more each 
(21 days or more for a transfer) of any type, or a gap of 46 days (61 
days for a transfer) or more and at least one violation, the lender must 
satisfy the requirement outlined in section I.D.1. for reinsurance on 
the loan to be reinstated. The Secretary does not pay any interest 
benefits or special allowance for the period beginning with the lender's 
earliest unexcused violation occurring after the last payment received 
before the cure is accomplished and ending with the date, if any, that 
reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.
    D. Reinstatement of Reinsurance Coverage for Certain Egregious Due 
Diligence Violations.
    1. Cures. In the case of a loan involving violations described in 
section I.C.2.d. or I.C.3.d., the lender may utilize either of the two 
procedures described in section I.D.1.a or I.D.1.b. for obtaining 
reinstatement of reinsurance coverage on the loan.
    a. After the violations occur, the lender obtains a new repayment 
agreement signed by the borrower. The repayment agreement must comply 
with the repayment period limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(8) 
and 682.209(h)(2); or
    b. After the violations occur, the lender obtains one full payment. 
If the borrower later defaults, the guaranty agency must obtain evidence 
of this payment (e.g., a copy of the check) from the lender.
    2. Borrower Deemed Current as of Date of Cure. On the date the 
lender receives a new signed repayment agreement or the curing payment 
under section I.D.1., reinsurance coverage on the loan is reinstated, 
and the borrower must be deemed by the lender to be current in repaying 
the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits available to borrowers 
who are not in default. The lender must then follow the collection and 
timely filing requirements applicable to the loan.
    E. Cures for Timely Filing Violations and Certain Due Diligence 
Violations
    1. Default Claims.
    a. Reinstatement of Insurance Coverage. Except as noted in section 
I.B.6., in order to obtain reinstatement of reinsurance coverage on a 
loan in the case of a timely filing violation, a due diligence violation 
described in section I.C.2.c. or I.C.3.c., or a due diligence violation 
described in section I.C.1.c. where the lender holds the loan on or 
after March 15, 1988, the lender must first locate the borrower after 
the gap, or after the date of the last violation, as applicable. (See 
section I.E.1.d. for description of acceptable evidence of location.) 
Within 15 days thereafter, the lender must send to the borrower, at the 
address at which the borrower was located, (i) a new repayment 
agreement, to be signed by the borrower, that complies with the ten-year 
repayment limitations in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7), along with (ii) a 
collection letter indicating in strong terms the seriousness of the 
borrower's delinquency and its potential effect on his or her credit 
rating if repayment is not commenced or resumed. If, within 15 days 
after the lender sends these items, the borrower fails to make a full 
payment or to sign and return the new repayment agreement, the lender 
must, within 5 days thereafter, diligently attempt to contact the 
borrower by telephone. Within 5-10 days after completing these efforts, 
the lender must again diligently attempt to contact the borrower by 
telephone. Finally, within 5-10 days after completing these efforts, the 
lender must send a forceful collection letter indicating that the entire 
unpaid balance of the loan is due and payable, and that, unless the 
borrower immediately contacts the lender to arrange repayment, the 
lender will be filing a default claim with the guaranty agency.
    b. Borrower Deemed Current Under Certain Circumstances. If, at any 
time on or before the 30th day after the lender completes the additional 
collection efforts described in section I.E.1.a., or the 270th day of 
delinquency, whichever is later, the lender receives a full payment or a 
new signed repayment agreement, reinsurance coverage on the loan is 
reinstated on the date the lender receives the full payment or new 
agreement. The borrower must be deemed by the lender to be

[[Page 825]]

current in repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits 
available to borrowers who are not in default. In the case of a timely 
filing violation on a loan for which the borrower is deemed current 
under this paragraph, the lender is ineligible to receive interest 
benefits and special allowance accruing from the date of the violation 
to the date of reinstatement of reinsurance coverage on the loan.
    c. Borrower Deemed in Default Under Certain Circumstances. If the 
borrower does not make a full payment, or sign and return the new 
repayment agreement, on or before the 30th day after the lender 
completes the additional collection efforts described in section 
I.E.1.a., or the 270th day of delinquency, whichever is later, the 
lender must deem the borrower to be in default. The lender must then 
file a default claim on the loan, accompanied by acceptable evidence of 
location (see section I.E.1.d.), within 30 days after the end of the 30-
day period. Reinsurance coverage, and therefore the lender's right to 
receive interest benefits and special allowance, is not reinstated on a 
loan involving these circumstances. However, the Secretary will honor 
reinsurance claims submitted in accordance with this paragraph on the 
outstanding principal balance of those loans, on unpaid interest as 
provided in section I.B.7., and for reimbursement of eligible 
supplemental preclaims assistance costs. In the case of a timely filing 
violation on a loan for which the borrower is deemed in default under 
this paragraph, the lender is ineligible to receive interest benefits 
and special allowance accruing from the date of the violation.
    d. Acceptable Evidence of Location. Only the following documentation 
is acceptable as evidence that the lender has located the borrower:
    (1) A postal receipt signed by the borrower not more than 15 days 
prior to the date on which the lender sent the new repayment agreement, 
indicating acceptance of correspondence from the lender by the borrower 
at the address shown on the receipt; or
    (2) Documentation submitted by the lender showing--
    (i) The name, identification number, and address of the lender;
    (ii) The name and Social Security number of the borrower; and
    (iii) A signed certification by an employee or agent of the lender, 
that--
    (A) On a specified date, he or she spoke with or received written 
communication (attached to the certification) from the borrower on the 
loan underlying the default claim, or a parent, spouse, sibling, 
roommate, or neighbor of the borrower;
    (B) The address and, if available, telephone number of the borrower 
were provided to the lender in the telephone or written communication; 
and
    (C) In the case of a borrower whose address or telephone number was 
provided to the lender by someone other than the borrower, the new 
repayment agreement and the letter sent by the lender pursuant to 
section I.E.1.a., had not been returned undelivered as of 20 days after 
the date those items were sent, for due diligence violations described 
in section I.C.1.c. where the lender holds the loan on the date of this 
letter, and as of the date the lender filed a default claim on the cured 
loan, for all other violations.
    2. Death, Disability, and Bankruptcy Claims. The Secretary will 
honor a death or disability claim on an otherwise eligible loan 
notwithstanding the lender's failure to meet the 60-day timely filing 
requirement (See 34 CFR 682.402(g)(2)(i)). However, the Secretary will 
not reimburse the guaranty agency if, before the date the lender 
determined that the borrower died or was totally and permanently 
disabled, the lender had violated the Federal due diligence or timely 
filing requirements applicable to that loan, except in accordance with 
the waiver policy described above. Interest that accrued on the loan 
after the expiration of the 60-day filing period remains ineligible for 
reimbursement by the Secretary, and the lender must repay all interest 
and special allowance received on the loan for periods after the 
expiration of the 60-day filing period. The Secretary has determined 
that, in the vast majority of cases, the failure of a lender to comply 
with the timely filing requirement applicable to bankruptcy claims 
(Sec. 682.402(g)(2)(iv)) causes irreparable harm to the guaranty 
agency's ability to contest the discharge of the loan by the court, or 
to otherwise collect from the borrower. Therefore, the Secretary has 
decided not to excuse violations of the timely filing requirement 
applicable to bankruptcy claims, except when the lender can demonstrate 
that the bankruptcy action has concluded and that the loan has not been 
discharged in bankruptcy or, if previously discharged, has been the 
subject of a reversal of the discharge. In that case, the lender must 
return the borrower to the appropriate status that existed prior to the 
filing of the bankruptcy claim unless the status has changed due solely 
to passage of time. In the latter case, the lender must place the 
borrower in the status that would exist had no bankruptcy claim been 
filed. If the borrower is delinquent after the loan is determined 
nondischargeable, the lender should grant administrative forbearance to 
bring the borrower's account current as provided in Sec. 682.211(f)(4) 
and Sec. 682.402(f)(5)(ii) and (f)(6). The Secretary will not reimburse 
the guaranty agency for interest for the period beginning on the filing 
deadline for the bankruptcy claim and ending on the date the loan 
becomes eligible again for reinsurance. Reinsurance is reinstated on the 
date the bankruptcy action concludes and the loan is not

[[Page 826]]

discharged or on the date a previous discharge is reversed.
    II. Due Date of First Payment. Section 682.411(b)(1) refers to the 
``due date of the first missed payment not later made'' as one way to 
determine the first day of delinquency on a loan. Section 682.209(a)(3) 
states that, generally, the repayment period on an FFEL Program loan 
begins some number of months after the month in which the borrower 
ceases at least half-time study. Where the borrower enters the repayment 
period with the lender's knowledge, the first payment due date may be 
set by the lender, provided it falls within a reasonable time after the 
first day of the month in which the repayment period begins. In this 
situation, the Secretary generally permits a lender to allow the 
borrower up to 45 days from the first day of repayment to make the first 
payment (unless the lender establishes the first day of repayment under 
Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E)).
    1. In cases where the lender learns that the borrower has entered 
the repayment period after the fact, current Sec. 682.411 treats the 
30th day after the lender receives this information as the first day of 
delinquency. In the course of discussion with lenders, the Secretary has 
learned that many lenders have not been using the 30th day after receipt 
of notice that the repayment period has begun (``the notice'') as the 
first payment due date. In recognition of this apparently widespread 
practice, the Secretary has decided that, both retrospectively and 
prospectively, a lender should be allowed to establish a first payment 
due date within 60 days after receipt of the notice, to capitalize 
interest accruing up to the first payment due date, and to exercise 
forbearance with respect to the period during which the borrower was in 
the repayment period but made no payment. In effect, this means that, if 
the lender sends the borrower a coupon book, billing notice, or other 
correspondence establishing a new first payment due date, on or before 
the 60th day after receipt of the notice, the lender is deemed to have 
exercised forbearance up to the new first payment due date. The new 
first payment due date must fall no later than 75 days after receipt of 
the notice (unless the lender establishes the first day of repayment 
under Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E)). In keeping with the 5-day tolerance 
permitted under section I.C.2.a., for the ``prospective period,'' or 
section I.C.3.a., for the ``post 1998 amendment period,'' a lender that 
sends the above-described material on or before the 65th day after 
receipt of the notice will be held harmless. However, a lender that does 
so on the 66th day will have failed by more than 5 days to send both of 
the collection letters required by Sec. 682.411(c) to be sent within the 
first 30 days of delinquency and will thus have committed two violations 
of more than five days of that rule.
    2. If the lender fails to send the material establishing a new first 
payment due date on or before the 65th day after receipt of the notice, 
it may thereafter send material establishing a new first payment due 
date falling not more than 45 days after the materials are sent and will 
be deemed to have exercised forbearance up to the new first payment due 
date. However, all violations and gaps occurring prior to the date on 
which the material is sent are subject to the waiver policies described 
in section I for violations falling in either the retrospective or 
prospective periods. This is an exception to the general policy set 
forth in section I.B.5., that only violations occurring during the most 
recent 180 or 270 days (as applicable) of the delinquency period on a 
loan are relevant to the Secretary's examination of due diligence.
    Please Note: References to the ``65th day after receipt of the 
notice'' and ``66th day'' in the preceding paragraphs should be amended 
to read ``95th day'' and ``96th day'' respectively for lenders subject 
to Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E).
    III. Questions and Answers
    The waiver policy outlined in this letter was developed after 
extensive discussion and consultation with participating lenders and 
guaranty agencies. In the course of these discussions, lenders and 
agencies raised a number of questions regarding the due diligence rules 
as applied to various circumstances. The Secretary's responses to these 
questions follow.
    Note: The answer to questions 1 and 4 are applicable only to loans 
subject to Sec. 682.411 of the FFEL and PLUS program regulations 
published on or after November 10, 1986.
    1. Q: Section 682.411 of the program regulations requires the lender 
to make ``diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone'' during 
each 30-day period of delinquency beginning after the 30th day of 
delinquency. What must a lender do to comply with this requirement?
    A: Generally speaking, one actual telephone contact with the 
borrower, or two attempts to make such contact on different days and at 
different times, will satisfy the ``diligent efforts'' requirement for 
any of the 30-day delinquency periods described in the rule. However, 
the ``diligent efforts'' requirement is intended to be a flexible one, 
requiring the lender to act on information it receives in the course of 
attempting telephone contact regarding the borrower's actual telephone 
number, the best time to call to reach the borrower, etc. For instance, 
if the lender is told during its second telephone contact attempt that 
the borrower can be reached at another number or at a different time of 
day, the lender must then attempt to reach the borrower by telephone at 
that number or that time of day.

[[Page 827]]

    2. Q: What must a lender do when it receives conflicting information 
regarding the date a borrower ceased at least half-time study?
    A: A lender must promptly attempt to reconcile conflicting 
information regarding a borrower's in-school status by making inquiries 
of appropriate parties, including the borrower's school. Pending 
reconciliation, the lender may rely on the most recent credible 
information it has.
    3. Q: If a loan is transferred from one lender to another, is the 
transferee held responsible for information regarding the borrower's 
status that is received by the transferor but is not passed on to the 
transferee?
    A: No. A lender is responsible only for information received by its 
agents and employees. However, if the transferee has reason to believe 
that the transferor has received additional information regarding the 
loan, the transferee must make a reasonable inquiry of the transferor as 
to the nature and substance of that information.
    4. Q: What are a lender's due diligence responsibilities where a 
check received on a loan is dishonored by the bank on which it was 
drawn?
    A: Upon receiving notice that a check has been dishonored, the 
lender must treat the payment as having never been made for purposes of 
determining the number of days that the borrower is delinquent at that 
time. The lender must then begin (or resume) attempting collection on 
the loan in accordance with Sec. 682.411, commencing with the first 30-
day delinquency period described in Sec. 682.411 that begins after the 
30-day delinquency period in which the notice of dishonor is received. 
The same result occurs when the lender successfully obtains a delinquent 
borrower's correct address through skip-tracing, or when a delinquent 
borrower leaves deferment or forbearance status.

                      Subpart A--Purpose and Scope


<R05>
Sec. 685.100  The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program.

    (a) Under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) 
Program (formerly known as the Federal Direct Student Loan Program), the 
Secretary makes loans to enable a student or parent to pay the costs of 
the student's attendance at a postsecondary school. This part governs 
the Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the Federal Direct 
Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the Federal Direct PLUS 
Program, and the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program. The 
Secretary makes loans under the following program components:
    (1) Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program (formerly known as the 
Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program), which provides loans to 
undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The Secretary 
subsidizes the interest while the borrower is in an in-school, grace, or 
deferment period.
    (2) Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program (formerly 
known as the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program), which 
provides loans to undergraduate, graduate and professional students. The 
borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues during any period.
    (3) Federal Direct PLUS Program, which provides loans to parents of 
dependent students. The borrower is responsible for the interest that 
accrues during any period.
    (4) Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program, which provides loans 
to borrowers to consolidate certain Federal educational loans.
    (b) The Secretary makes a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan only to a student or a parent 
of a student enrolled in a school that has been selected by the 
Secretary to participate in the Direct Loan Program.
    (c) The Secretary makes a Direct Consolidation Loan only to--
    (1) A borrower with a loan made under the Direct Loan Program; or
    (2) A borrower with a loan made under the Federal Family Education 
Loan Program who is not able to receive--
    (i) A Federal Consolidation Loan; or
    (ii) A Federal Consolidation Loan with income-sensitive repayment 
terms that are satisfactory to the borrower.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.)


<R05>
Sec. 685.101  Participation in the Direct Loan Program.

    (a)(1) Colleges, universities, graduate and professional schools, 
vocational schools, and proprietary schools selected by the Secretary 
may participate in the Direct Loan Program. Participation in the Direct 
Loan Program enables an eligible student or parent to obtain a loan to 
pay for the student's cost of attendance at the school.
    (2) The Secretary may permit a school to participate in both the 
Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, as defined in 34 CFR part 
600, and the Direct Loan Program. A school permitted to participate in 
both the FFEL Program and the Direct Loan Program may certify loan 
applications under the FFEL Program according to the terms of its 
agreement with the Secretary.
    (b) An eligible student who is enrolled at a school participating in 
the Direct Loan Program may borrow under the Federal Direct Stafford/
Ford Loan and Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Programs. 
An eligible parent of an eligible dependent student enrolled at a school 
participating in the Direct Loan Program may borrow under the Federal 
Direct PLUS Program.

repayment period begins.
    Half-time student: A student who is not a full-time student and who 
is enrolled in an institution of higher education and is carrying an 
academic workload that is at least one-half the workload of a full-time 
student, as determined by the school. A student enrolled solely in an 
eligible program of study by correspondence is considered a half-time 
student.

disbursement if no disbursement is made during that twelve-month period; 
or
    (iii) Ten years after the date of the first anticipated disbursement 
except that a remaining portion of a loan may be disbursed after this 
date.
    Period of enrollment: The period for which a Direct Subsidized, 
Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan is intended. The period of 
enrollment must coincide with one or more academic terms established by 
the school (such as semester, trimester, quarter, academic year, and 
length of the program of study), for which institutional charges are 
generally assessed. The period of enrollment is also referred to in this 
part as the loan period.
    Satisfactory repayment arrangement. (1) For the purpose of regaining 
eligibility under section 428F(b) of the HEA, the making of six

685.220(d)(1)(ii)(E), the making of three consecutive, voluntary, on-
time, full monthly payments on a defaulted loan.
    (3) The required monthly payment amount may not be more than is 
reasonable and affordable based on the borrower's total financial 
circumstances. ``On-time'' means a payment made within 15 days of the 
scheduled due date, and voluntary payments are those payments made 
directly by the borrower, regardless of whether there is a judgment 
against the borrower, and do not include payments obtained by income tax 
offset, garnishment, or income or asset execution.

Unsubsidized Loan. (1) To obtain a Direct Subsidized Loan or a Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan, a student must complete a Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid and submit it in accordance with instructions in the 
application.
    (2) If the student is eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan or a 
Direct Unsubsidized Loan, the Secretary or the school in which the 
student is enrolled must perform specific functions. Unless a school's 
agreement with the Secretary specifies otherwise, the school must 
perform the following functions:
    (i) A school participating under school origination option 2 must 
create a loan origination record, ensure that the loan is supported by a 
completed Master Promissory Note (MPN), draw down funds, and disburse 
the funds to the student.
    (ii) A school participating under school origination option 1 must 
create a loan origination record, ensure that the loan is supported by a 
completed MPN, and transmit the record and MPN (if required) to the 
Servicer. The Servicer initiates the drawdown of funds. The school must 
disburse the funds to the student.
    (iii) If the student is attending a school participating under 
standard origination, the school must create a loan origination record 
and transmit the record to the alternative originator, which either 
confirms that a completed MPN supports the loan or prepares an MPN and 
sends it to the student. The Servicer receives the completed MPN from 
the student (if required) and initiates the drawdown of funds. The 
school must disburse the funds to the student.
    (b) Application for a Direct PLUS Loan. To obtain a Direct PLUS 
Loan, the parent must complete the application and promissory note and 
submit it to the school at which the student is enrolled. The school 
must complete its portion of the application and promissory note and 
submit it to the Servicer, which makes a determination as to whether the 
parent has an adverse credit history. Unless a school's agreement with 
the Secretary specifies otherwise, the school must perform the following 
functions: A school participating under school origination option 2 must 
draw down funds and disburse the funds. For a school participating under 
school origination option 1 or standard origination, the Servicer 
initiates the drawdown of funds, and the school disburses the funds.
    (c) Application for a Direct Consolidation Loan. (1) To obtain a 
Direct Consolidation Loan, the applicant must complete the application 
and promissory note and submit it to the Servicer. The application and 
promissory note sets forth the terms and conditions of the Direct 
Consolidation Loan and informs the applicant how to contact the 
Servicer. The Servicer answers questions regarding the process of 
applying for a Direct Consolidation Loan and provides information about 
the terms and conditions of both Direct Consolidation Loans and the 
types of loans that may be consolidated.
    (2) Once the applicant has submitted the completed application and 
promissory note to the Servicer, the Secretary makes the Direct 
Consolidation Loan under the procedures specified in Sec. 685.220.

    (ii) Interest rate for Direct PLUS Consolidation Loans. (A) Loans 
first disbursed before July 1, 1998. The interest rate is the rate 
established for Direct PLUS Loans in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (B) Loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 
1, 1998 and prior to October 1, 1998, and loans for which the 
disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1998 for which the 
consolidation application was received by the Secretary before October 
1, 1998. The interest rate is the rate established for Direct PLUS Loans 
in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (C) Loans for which the consolidation application is received by the 
Secretary on or after October 1, 1998 and before February 1, 1999. 
During all periods, the interest rate during any twelve-month period 
beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 is determined on the June 1 
immediately preceding that period. The interest rate is equal to the 
bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned at the final 
auction held prior to that June 1 plus 2.3 percentage points, but does 
not exceed 8.25 percent.
    (D) Loans for which the consolidation application is received by the 
Secretary on or after February 1, 1999. During all periods, the interest 
rate is based on the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans 
being consolidated, rounded to the nearest higher one-eighth of one 
percent, but does not exceed 8.25 percent.
    (b) Capitalization. (1) The Secretary may add unpaid accrued 
interest to the borrower's unpaid principal balance. This increase in 
the principal balance of a loan is called ``capitalization.''
    (2) For a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or a Direct Unsubsidized 
Consolidation Loan that qualifies for a grace period, the Secretary 
capitalizes the unpaid interest that accrues on the loan when the 
borrower enters repayment.
    (3) Notwithstanding Sec. 685.208(g)(5) and Sec. 685.209(d)(3), for a 
Direct Loan not eligible for interest subsidies during periods of 
deferment, and for all Direct Loans during periods of forbearance, the 
Secretary capitalizes the unpaid interest that has accrued on the loan 
upon the expiration of the deferment or forbearance.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and in 
Sec. 685.208(g)(5), and Sec. 685.209(d)(3), the Secretary annually 
capitalizes unpaid interest when the borrower is paying under the 
alternative or income contingent repayment plans and the borrower's 
scheduled payments do not cover the interest that has accrued on the 
loan.
    (5) The Secretary may capitalize unpaid interest when the borrower 
defaults on the loan.
    (c) Loan fee for Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct 
PLUS Loans. The Secretary--
    (1)(i) Charges a borrower a loan fee not to exceed four percent of 
the principal amount of the loan on a Direct Subsidized or Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan; and
    (ii) Charges a borrower a loan fee of four percent of the principal 
amount of the loan on a Direct PLUS Loan.
    (2) Deducts the loan fee from the proceeds of the loan;
    (3) In the case of a loan disbursed in multiple installments, 
deducts a pro rated portion of the fee from each disbursement; and
    (4) Applies to a borrower's loan balance the portion of the loan fee 
previously deducted from the loan that is attributable to any portion of 
the loan that is--
    (i) Repaid or returned within 120 days of disbursement, unless--

[[Page 837]]

    (A) The borrower has no Direct Loans in repayment status and has 
requested, in writing, that the repaid or returned funds be used for a 
different purpose; or
    (B) The borrower has a Direct Loan in repayment status, in which 
case the payment is applied in accordance with Sec. 685.211(a) unless 
the borrower has requested, in writing, that the repaid or returned 
funds be applied as a cancellation of all or part of the loan; or
    (ii) Returned by a school in order to comply with the Act or with 
applicable regulations.
    (d) Late charge. (1) The Secretary may require the borrower to pay a 
late charge of up to six cents for each dollar of each installment or 
portion thereof that is late under the circumstances described in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) The late charge may be assessed if the borrower fails to pay all 
or a portion of a required installment payment within 30 days after it 
is due.
    (e)(1) Collection charges before default. Notwithstanding any 
provision of State law, the Secretary may require that the borrower or 
any endorser pay costs incurred by the Secretary or the Secretary's 
agents in collecting installments not paid when due. These charges do 
not include routine collection costs associated with preparing letters 
or notices or with making personal contacts with the borrower (e.g., 
local and long-distance telephone calls).
    (2) Collection charges after default. If a borrower defaults on a 
Direct Loan, the Secretary assesses collection costs on the basis of 34 
CFR 30.60.

    (2) the periods described in 34 CFR 682.210(b), including those

borrower for loan forgiveness under the requirements of the teacher loan 
forgiveness program in Sec. 685.217; and
    (ii) Is required, by the Secretary, before a forbearance is granted 
under Sec. 685.205(a)(5)(i) to--
    (A) Submit documentation for the period of the annual forbearance 
request showing the beginning and ending dates that the borrower is

    (ii) Under Sec. 685.215;
    (iii) Under Sec. 685.216;
    (iv) Under Sec. 685.217; or
    (v) Due to the borrower's or endorser's (if applicable) bankruptcy;
    (7) A period of up to three years in cases where the effect of a 
variable interest rate on a fixed-amount or graduated repayment schedule 
causes the extension of the maximum repayment term;
    (8) A period during which the Secretary has authorized forbearance 
due to a national military mobilization or other local or national 
emergency; or
    (9) A period of up to 60 days necessary for the Secretary to collect 
and process documentation supporting the borrower's request for a 
deferment, forbearance, change in repayment plan, or consolidation loan. 
Interest that accrues during this period is not capitalized.
    (c) Period of forbearance. (1) The Secretary grants forbearance for 
a period of up to one year.
    (2) The forbearance is renewable, upon request of the borrower, for 
the duration of the period in which the borrower meets the condition 
required for the forbearance.

omission of the school attended by the student that would give rise to a 
cause of action against the school under applicable State law. These 
proceedings include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Tax refund offset proceedings under 34 CFR 30.33.
    (ii) Wage garnishment proceedings under section 488A of the Act.
    (iii) Salary offset proceedings for Federal employees under 34 CFR 
part 31.
    (iv) Credit bureau reporting proceedings under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f).
    (2) If the borrower's defense against repayment is successful, the 
Secretary notifies the borrower that the borrower is relieved of the 
obligation to repay all or part of the loan and associated costs and 
fees that the borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay. The 
Secretary affords the borrower such further relief as the Secretary 
determines is appropriate under the circumstances. Further relief may 
include, but is not limited to, the following:
    (i) Reimbursing the borrower for amounts paid toward the loan 
voluntarily or through enforced collection.
    (ii) Determining that the borrower is not in default on the loan and 
is eligible to receive assistance under title IV of the Act.
    (iii) Updating reports to credit bureaus to which the Secretary 
previously made adverse credit reports with regard to the borrower's 
Direct Loan.
    (3) The Secretary may initiate an appropriate proceeding to require 
the school whose act or omission resulted in the borrower's successful 
defense against repayment of a Direct Loan to pay to the Secretary the 
amount of the loan to which the defense applies. However, the Secretary 
does not initiate such a proceeding after the period for the retention 
of records described in Sec. 685.309(c) unless the school received 
actual notice of the claim during that period.

Consolidation Loan under the standard repayment plan, the extended 
repayment plan, or the graduated repayment plan.
    (3) The Secretary may provide an alternative repayment plan in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (4) All Direct Loans obtained by one borrower must be repaid 
together under the same repayment plan, except that a borrower of a

Direct PLUS Loan or the Direct PLUS Consolidation Loan separately from 
other Direct Loans obtained by that borrower.
    (b) Standard repayment plan. (1) Under the standard repayment plan, 
a borrower shall repay a loan in full within ten years from the date the 
loan entered repayment by making fixed monthly payments.
    (2) Periods of authorized deferment or forbearance are not included 
in the ten-year repayment period.
    (3) A borrower's payments under the standard repayment plan are at 
least $50 per month, except that a borrower's final payment may be less 
than $50.
    (4) The number of payments or the fixed monthly repayment amount may 
be adjusted to reflect changes in the variable interest rate identified 
in Sec. 685.202(a).
    (c) Extended repayment plan. (1) Under the extended repayment plan, 
a borrower shall repay a loan in full by making fixed monthly payments 
within an extended period of time that varies with the total amount of 
the borrower's loans, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Periods of deferment and forbearance are not included in the 
number of years of repayment.
    (3) A borrower makes fixed monthly payments of at least $50, except

    (d) Graduated repayment plan. (1) Under the graduated repayment 
plan, a

[[Page 847]]

borrower shall repay a loan in full by making payments at two or more 
levels within a period of time that varies with the total amount of the 
borrower's loans, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Periods of deferment and forbearance are not included in the 
number of years of repayment.
    (3) The number of payments or the monthly repayment amount may be

Sec. 685.202(a).
    (4) No scheduled payment under the graduated repayment plan may be 
less than the amount of interest accrued on the loan between monthly 
payments, less than 50 percent of the payment amount that would be 
required under the standard repayment plan, or more than 150 percent of 
the payment amount that would be required under the standard repayment 
plan.
    (e) Repayment period for the extended and graduated plans. Under the 
extended and graduated repayment plans, if the total amount of the 
borrower's Direct Loans is--
    (1) Less than $10,000, the borrower shall repay the loans within 12 
years of entering repayment;
    (2) Greater than or equal to $10,000 but less than $20,000, the

generally based on the total amount of the borrower's Direct Loans, 
family size, and Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) reported by the borrower 
for the most recent year for which the Secretary has obtained income 
information. The borrower's AGI includes the income of the borrower's 
spouse. A borrower shall make payments on a loan until the loan is 
repaid in full or until the loan has been in repayment through the end 
of the income contingent repayment period.
    (2) The regulations in effect at the time a borrower enters 
repayment and selects the income contingent repayment plan or changes 
into the income contingent repayment plan from another plan govern the 
method for determining the borrower's monthly repayment amount for all 
of the borrower's Direct Loans, unless--
    (i) The Secretary amends the regulations relating to a borrower's 
monthly repayment amount under the income contingent repayment plan; and
    (ii) The borrower submits a written request that the amended 
regulations apply to the repayment of the borrower's Direct Loans.
    (3) Provisions governing the income contingent repayment plan are 
set out in Sec. 685.209.
    (g) Alternative repayment. (1) The Secretary may provide an 
alternative repayment plan for a borrower who demonstrates to the 
Secretary's satisfaction that the terms and conditions of the repayment 
plans specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section are not 
adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances.
    (2) The Secretary may require a borrower to provide evidence of the 
borrower's exceptional circumstances before permitting the borrower to 
repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan.
    (3) If the Secretary agrees to permit a borrower to repay a loan 
under an alternative repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower 
in writing of the terms of the plan. After the borrower receives 
notification of the terms of the plan, the borrower may accept the plan 
or choose another repayment plan.
    (4) A borrower shall repay a loan under an alternative repayment 
plan within 30 years of the date the loan entered repayment, not 
including periods of deferment and forbearance.
    (5) If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment under an 
alternative repayment plan is less than the accrued interest on the 
loan, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal 
amount is 10 percent

[[Page 848]]

greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding 
principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal 
amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the original principal amount is the amount 
owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.

<R05>
Sec. 685.209  Income contingent repayment plan.

    (a) Repayment amount calculation. (1) The amount the borrower would 
repay is based upon the borrower's Direct Loan debt when the borrower's 
first loan enters repayment, and this basis for calculation does not 
change unless the borrower obtains another Direct Loan or the borrower 
and the borrower's spouse obtain approval to repay their loans jointly 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the borrower obtains another 
Direct Loan, the amount the borrower would repay is based on the 
combined amounts of the loans when the last loan enters repayment. If 
the borrower and the borrower's spouse repay the loans jointly, the 
amount the borrowers would repay is based on both borrowers' Direct Loan 
debts at the time they enter joint repayment.
    (2) The annual amount payable under the income contingent repayment 
plan by a borrower is the lesser of--
    (i) The amount the borrower would repay annually over 12 years using 
standard amortization multiplied by an income percentage factor that 
corresponds to the borrower's adjusted gross income (AGI) as shown in 
the income percentage factor table in a notice published annually by the 
Secretary in the Federal Register; or
    (ii) 20 percent of discretionary income.
    (3) For purposes of this section, discretionary income is defined as 
a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the ``HHS Poverty Guidelines for 
all States (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia'' as 
published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services 
on an annual basis.<SUP>1</SUP> For residents of Alaska and Hawaii, 
discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amounts in 
the ``HHS Poverty Guidelines for Alaska'' and the ``HHS Poverty 
Guidelines for Hawaii'' respectively. If a borrower provides 
documentation acceptable to the Secretary that the borrower has more 
than one person in the borrower's family, the Secretary applies the HHS 
Poverty Guidelines for the borrower's family size.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The HHS Poverty Guidelines are available from the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS), Room 438F, Humphrey Building, 200 Independence 
Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) For exact incomes not shown in the income percentage factor 
table in the annual notice published by the Secretary, an income 
percentage factor is calculated, based upon the intervals between the 
incomes and income percentage factors shown on the table.
    (5) Each year, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's annual 
payment amount based on changes in the borrower's AGI, the variable 
interest rate, the income percentage factors in the table in the annual 
notice published by the Secretary, and updated HHS Poverty Guidelines 
(if applicable).
    (6) If a borrower's monthly payment is calculated to be greater than 
$0 but less than or equal to $5.00, the amount payable by the borrower 
shall be $5.00.
    (7) For purposes of the annual recalculation described in paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section, after periods in which a borrower makes payments 
that are less than interest accrued on the loan, the payment amount is 
recalculated based upon unpaid accrued interest and the highest 
outstanding principal loan amount (including amount capitalized) 
calculated for that borrower while paying under the income contingent 
repayment plan.
    (8) For each calendar year after calendar year 1996, the Secretary 
publishes in the Federal Register a revised income percentage factor 
table reflecting changes based on inflation. This revised table is 
developed by changing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table 
by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage

[[Page 849]]

changes in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) 
between December 1995 and the December next preceding the beginning of 
such calendar year.
    (9) Examples of the calculation of monthly repayment amounts and 
tables that show monthly repayment amounts for borrowers at various 
income and debt levels are included in the annual notice published by 
the Secretary.
    (b) Treatment of married borrowers. (1) A married borrower who 
wishes to repay under the income contingent repayment plan and who has 
filed an income tax return separately from his or her spouse must 
provide his or her spouse's written consent to the disclosure of certain 
tax return information under paragraph (c)(5) of this section (unless 
the borrower is separated from his or her spouse). The AGI for both 
spouses is used to calculate the monthly repayment amount.
    (2) Married borrowers may repay their loans jointly. The outstanding 
balances on the loans of each borrower are added together to determine 
the borrowers' payback rate under (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) The amount of the payment applied to each borrower's debt is the 
proportion of the payments that equals the same proportion as that 
borrower's debt to the total outstanding balance, except that the 
payment is credited toward outstanding interest on any loan before any 
payment is credited toward principal.
    (c) Other features of the income contingent repayment plan. (1) 
Alternative documentation of income. If a borrower's AGI is not 
available or if, in the Secretary's opinion, the borrower's reported AGI 
does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, the Secretary 
may use other documentation of income provided by the borrower to 
calculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount.
    (2) First and second year borrowers. The Secretary requires 
alternative documentation of income from borrowers in their first and 
second years of repayment, when in the Secretary's opinion, the 
borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's 
current income.
    (3) Adjustments to repayment obligations. The Secretary may 
determine that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by 
the borrower or the borrower's spouse, warrant an adjustment to the 
borrower's repayment obligations.
    (4) Repayment period. (i) The maximum repayment period under the 
income contingent repayment plan is 25 years.
    (ii) The repayment period includes periods in which the borrower 
makes payments under the standard repayment plan and under extended 
repayment plans in which payments are based on a repayment period that 
is up to 12 years. The repayment period does not include periods in 
which the borrower makes payments under the graduated and alternative 
repayment plans or periods of authorized deferment or forbearance. The 
repayment period also does not include periods in which the borrower 
makes payments under an extended repayment plan in which payments are 
based on a repayment period that is longer than 12 years.
    (iii) If a borrower repays more than one loan under the income 
contingent repayment plan, a separate repayment period for each loan 
begins when that loan enters repayment.
    (iv) If a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end of the 
25-year repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan, the 
Secretary cancels the unpaid portion of the loan.
    (v) At the beginning of the repayment period under the income 
contingent repayment plan, a borrower shall make monthly payments of the 
amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loans until the 
Secretary calculates the borrower's monthly repayment amount on the 
basis of the borrower's income.
    (5) Limitation on capitalization of interest. If the amount of a 
borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid 
interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is ten 
percent greater than the original principal amount. After the 
outstanding principal amount is ten percent greater than the original 
amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the original

[[Page 850]]

amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters 
repayment.
    (6) Notification of terms and conditions. When a borrower elects or 
is required by the Secretary to repay a loan under the income contingent 
repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower of the terms and 
conditions of the plan, including--
    (i) That the Internal Revenue Service will disclose certain tax 
return information to the Secretary or the Secretary's agents; and
    (ii) That if the borrower believes that special circumstances 
warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations, as 
described in Sec. 685.209(c)(3), the borrower may contact the Secretary 
and obtain the Secretary's determination as to whether an adjustment is 
appropriate.
    (7) Consent to disclosure of tax return information. (i) A borrower 
shall provide written consent to the disclosure of certain tax return 
information by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to agents of the 
Secretary for purposes of calculating a monthly repayment amount and 
servicing and collecting a loan under the income contingent repayment 
plan. The borrower shall provide consent by signing a consent form, 
developed consistent with 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1 and provided to the 
borrower by the Secretary, and shall return the signed form to the 
Secretary.
    (ii) The borrower shall consent to disclosure of the borrower's 
taxpayer identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(b)(6), tax 
filing status, and AGI.
    (iii) The borrower shall provide consent for a period of five years 
from the date the borrower signs the consent form. The Secretary 
provides the borrower a new consent form before that period expires. The 
IRS does not disclose tax return information after the IRS has processed 
a borrower's withdrawal of consent.
    (iv) The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a 
borrower who selects the income contingent repayment plan but--
    (A) Fails to provide the required written consent;
    (B) Fails to renew written consent upon the expiration of the five-
year period for consent; or
    (C) Withdraws consent and does not select another repayment plan.
    (v) If a borrower defaults and the Secretary designates the income 
contingent repayment plan for the borrower but the borrower fails to 
provide the required written consent, the Secretary mails a notice to 
the borrower establishing a repayment schedule for the borrower.

Sec. 685.210  Choice of repayment plan.

    (a) Initial selection of a repayment plan. (1) Before a Direct Loan 
enters into repayment, the Secretary provides the borrower a description 
of the available repayment plans and requests the borrower to select 
one. A borrower may select a repayment plan before the loan enters 
repayment by notifying the Secretary of the borrower's selection in 
writing.
    (2) If a borrower does not select a repayment plan, the Secretary 
designates the standard repayment plan described in Sec. 685.208(b) for 
the borrower.
    (b) Changing repayment plans. (1) A borrower may change repayment 
plans at any time after the loan has entered repayment by notifying the 
Secretary. However, a borrower who is repaying a defaulted loan under 
the income contingent repayment plan under Sec. 685.211(c)(3)(ii) may 
not change to another repayment plan unless--
    (i) The borrower was required to and did make a payment under the 
income contingent repayment plan in each of the prior three (3) months; 
or
    (ii) The borrower was not required to make payments but made three 
reasonable and affordable payments in each of the prior three months; 
and
    (iii) The borrower makes and the Secretary approves a request to 
change plans.

[[Page 851]]

    (2)(i) A borrower may not change to a repayment plan that has a 
maximum repayment period of less than the number of years the loan has 
already been in repayment, except that a borrower may change to the 
income contingent repayment plan at any time.
    (ii) If a borrower changes plans, the repayment period is the period 
provided under the borrower's new repayment plan, calculated from the 
date the loan initially entered repayment. However, if a borrower 
changes to the income contingent repayment plan, the repayment period is 
calculated as described in Sec. 685.209(c)(4).

Sec. 685.211  Miscellaneous repayment provisions.

    (a) Payment application and prepayment. (1) The Secretary applies 
any payment first to any accrued charges and collection costs, then to 
any outstanding interest, and then to outstanding principal.
    (2) A borrower may prepay all or part of a loan at any time without 
penalty. If a borrower pays any amount in excess of the amount due, the 
excess amount is a prepayment.
    (3) If a prepayment equals or exceeds the monthly repayment amount 
under the borrower's repayment plan, the Secretary--
    (i) Applies the prepaid amount according to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (ii) Advances the due date of the next payment unless the borrower 
requests otherwise; and
    (iii) Notifies the borrower of any revised due date for the next 
payment.
    (4) If a prepayment is less than the monthly repayment amount, the 
Secretary applies the prepayment according to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) Repayment incentives. To encourage on-time repayment, the 
Secretary may reduce the interest rate for a borrower who repays a loan 
under a system or on a schedule that meets requirements specified by the 
Secretary.
    (c) Refunds and returns of title IV, HEA program funds from schools. 
The Secretary applies any refund or return of title IV, HEA program 
funds that the Secretary receives from a school under Sec. 668.22 
against the borrower's outstanding principal and notifies the borrower 
of the refund or return.
    (d) Default. (1) Acceleration. If a borrower defaults on a Direct 
Loan, the entire unpaid balance and accrued interest are immediately due 
and payable.
    (2) Collection charges. If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, the 
Secretary assesses collection charges in accordance with 
Sec. 685.202(e).
    (3) Collection of a defaulted loan. (i) The Secretary may take any 
action authorized by law to collect a defaulted Direct Loan including, 
but not limited to, filing a lawsuit against the borrower, reporting the 
default to national credit bureaus, requesting the Internal Revenue 
Service to offset the borrower's Federal income tax refund, and 
garnishing the borrower's wages.
    (ii) If a borrower defaults on a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan or a Direct 
Subsidized Consolidation Loan, the Secretary may designate the income 
contingent repayment plan for the borrower.
    (e) Ineligible borrowers. (1) The Secretary determines that a 
borrower is ineligible if, at the time the loan was made and without the 
school's or the Secretary's knowledge, the borrower (or the student on 
whose behalf a parent borrowed) provided false or erroneous information 
or took actions that caused the borrower or student--
    (i) To receive a loan for which the borrower is wholly or partially 
ineligible;
    (ii) To receive interest benefits for which the borrower was 
ineligible; or
    (iii) To receive loan proceeds for a period of enrollment for which 
the borrower was not eligible.
    (2) If the Secretary makes the determination described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, the Secretary sends an ineligible borrower a 
demand letter that requires the borrower to repay some or all of a loan, 
as appropriate. The demand letter requires that within 30 days from the 
date the letter is mailed, the borrower repay any principal amount for 
which the borrower is

[[Page 852]]

ineligible and any accrued interest, including interest subsidized by 
the Secretary, through the previous quarter.
    (3) If a borrower fails to comply with the demand letter described 
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the borrower is in default on the 
entire loan.
    (4) A borrower may not consolidate a loan under Sec. 685.220 for 
which the borrower is wholly or partially ineligible.
    (f) Rehabilitation of defaulted loans. A defaulted Direct Loan is 
rehabilitated if the borrower makes 12 consecutive on-time, reasonable, 
and affordable monthly payments. The amount of such a payment is 
determined on the basis of the borrower's total financial circumstances. 
If a defaulted loan is rehabilitated, the Secretary instructs any credit 
bureau to which the default was reported to remove the default from the 
borrower's credit history.

Sec. 685.212  Discharge of a loan obligation.

    (a) Death. (1) If a borrower (or the student on whose behalf a 
parent borrowed a Direct PLUS Loan) dies, the Secretary discharges the 
obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments 
on the loan based on an original or certified copy of the borrower's (or 
student's in the case of a Direct PLUS loan) death certificate.
    (2) If an original or certified copy of the death certificate is not 
available, the Secretary discharges the loan only based on other 
reliable documentation that establishes, to the Secretary's 
satisfaction, that the borrower (or student) has died. The Secretary 
discharges a loan based on documentation other than an original or 
certified copy of the death certificate only under exceptional 
circumstances and on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) Total and permanent disability. If a borrower meets the 
requirements in Sec. 685.213(c), the Secretary discharges the obligation 
of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the 
loan.
    (c) Bankruptcy. If a borrower's obligation to repay a loan is 
discharged in bankruptcy, the Secretary does not require the borrower to 
make any further payments on the loan.
    (d) Closed schools. If a borrower meets the requirements in 
Sec. 685.214, the Secretary discharges the obligation of the borrower 
and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan. In the case 
of a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary discharges the portion of 
the consolidation loan equal to the amount of the discharge applicable 
to any loan disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 
that was included in the consolidation loan.
    (e) False certification and unauthorized disbursement. If a borrower 
meets the requirements in Sec. 685.215, the Secretary discharges the 
obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments 
on the loan. In the case of a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary 
discharges the portion of the consolidation loan equal to the amount of 
the discharge applicable to any loan disbursed, in whole or in part, on 
or after January 1, 1986 that was included in the consolidation loan.
    (f) Unpaid refunds. If a borrower meets the requirements in 
Sec. 685.216, the Secretary discharges the obligation of the borrower 
and any endorser to make any further payments on the amount of the loan 
equal to the unpaid refund and any accrued interest and other charges 
associated with the unpaid refund. In the case of a Direct Consolidation 
Loan, the Secretary discharges the portion of the consolidation loan 
equal to the amount of the unpaid refund owed on any loan disbursed, in 
whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 that was included in the 
consolidation loan.
    (g) Payments received after eligibility for discharge. (1) For the 
discharge conditions in paragraphs (a), (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section. Upon receipt of acceptable documentation and approval of the 
discharge request, the Secretary returns to the sender, or, for a 
discharge based on death, the borrower's estate, any payments received 
after the date that the eligibility requirements for discharge were met.
    (2) For the discharge condition in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Upon making a final determination of eligibility for

[[Page 853]]

discharge based on total and permanent disability, the Secretary returns 
to the sender any payments received after the date the borrower became 
totally and permanently disabled, as certified under Sec. 685.213(b).
    (3) For the discharge condition in paragraph (f) of this section. 
Upon receipt of acceptable documentation and approval of the discharge 
request, the Secretary returns to the sender payments received in excess 
of the amount owed on the loan after applying the unpaid refund.
    (h) Teacher loan forgiveness program. If a new borrower meets the 
requirements in Sec. 685.217, the Secretary repays up to $5,000 of the 
borrower's Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and, in 
certain cases, Direct Consolidation Loans.

<R05>
Sec. 685.213  Total and permanent disability discharge.

    (a) General. (1) If the Secretary makes an initial determination 
that a borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the Secretary--
    (i) Notifies the borrower that the loan will be in a conditional 
discharge status for up to three years from the date that the borrower 
became totally and permanently disabled, as certified under 685.213(b). 
The Secretary also notifies the borrower of the conditions of the 
conditional discharge period, and that all or part of the three-year 
conditional discharge period may predate the Secretary's initial 
determination.
    (ii) Suspends any efforts to collect on the loan from the date of 
the initial determination described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
until the end of the conditional discharge period.
    (2) If the borrower continues to meet the eligibility requirements 
for total and permanent disability discharge during and at the end of 
the three-year conditional discharge period, the Secretary--
    (i) Discharges the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to 
make any further payments on the loan at the end of that period; and
    (ii) Returns to the borrower any payments received after the date 
the borrower became totally and permanently disabled, as certified under 
Sec. 685.213(b).
    (3) If the borrower does not continue to meet the eligibility 
requirements for a total and permanent disability discharge at any time 
during or at the end of the three-year conditional discharge period, the 
Secretary resumes collection activity on the loan. The Secretary does 
not require the borrower to pay any interest that accrued on the loan 
from the date of the initial determination described in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section through the end of the conditional discharge period.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a 
borrower is not considered totally and permanently disabled based on a 
condition that existed at the time the loan was made, unless the 
borrower's condition substantially deteriorated after the loan was made 
so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled.
    (b) Initial determination of total and permanent disability. The 
Secretary makes an initial determination that a borrower is totally and 
permanently disabled if the borrower (or the borrower's representative) 
provides the Secretary with a certification (on a form approved by the 
Secretary) by a physician who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and 
legally authorized to practice in a State that the borrower is totally 
and permanently disabled as defined in 34 CFR 682.200(b).
    (c) Eligibility requirements for total and permanent disability 
discharge. A borrower meets the eligibility requirements for total and 
permanent disability discharge if, during and at the end of the three-
year conditional discharge period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section--
    (1) The borrower's annual earnings from employment do not exceed 100 
percent of the poverty line for a family of two, as determined in 
accordance with the Community Service Block Grant Act; and
    (2) The borrower does not receive a new loan under the Perkins, 
FFEL, or

[[Page 854]]

Direct Loan programs, except for a FFEL or Direct consolidation loan 
that does not include any loans that are in a conditional discharge 
status.
    (d) Conditional discharge period. During the conditional discharge 
period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the borrower--
    (1) Is not required to make any payments of principal or interest on 
the loan beginning on the date the Secretary makes an initial 
determination that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled;
    (2) Is not considered to be delinquent or in default on the loan, 
unless the loan was delinquent or in default at the time the conditional 
discharge was granted;
    (3) Must promptly notify the Secretary of any changes in the 
borrower's address or telephone number;
    (4) Must promptly notify the Secretary if the borrower's annual 
earnings from employment exceed the amount specified in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section; and
    (5) Must provide the Secretary, upon request, with additional 
documentation or information related to the borrower's eligibility for 
discharge under this section.
    (e) Provisions for discharge of Direct Consolidation Loans. (1) For 
a Direct Consolidation Loan, a borrower is considered totally and 
permanently disabled if he or she would be considered totally and 
permanently disabled under the provisions of this section for all of the 
loans that were included in the Direct Consolidation Loan if those loans 
had not been consolidated.
    (2) For the purposes of discharging a loan under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section, the provisions of this section apply to each loan included 
in the Direct Consolidation Loan, even if the loan is not a Direct Loan 
Program loan.
    (3) If requested, a borrower seeking to discharge a loan obligation 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must provide the Secretary with 
the disbursement dates of the underlying loans.

Sec. 685.214  Closed school discharge.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary discharges the borrower's (and any 
endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the 
provisions of this section if the borrower (or the student on whose 
behalf a parent borrowed) did not complete the program of study for 
which the loan was made because the school at which the borrower (or 
student) was enrolled closed, as described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (2) For purposes of this section--
    (i) A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to 
provide educational instruction in all programs, as determined by the 
Secretary; and
    (ii) ``School'' means a school's main campus or any location or 
branch of the main campus.
    (b) Relief pursuant to discharge. (1) Discharge under this section 
relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the 
loan and any accrued charges or collection costs with respect to the 
loan.
    (2) The discharge of a loan under this section qualifies the 
borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through 
enforced collection on the loan.
    (3) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a 
loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after 
discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under 
programs authorized by title IV of the Act.
    (4) The Secretary reports the discharge of a loan under this section 
to all credit reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously 
reported the status of the loan.
    (c) Borrower qualification for discharge. In order to qualify for 
discharge of a loan under this section, a borrower shall submit to the 
Secretary a written request and sworn statement, and the factual 
assertions in the statement must be true. The statement need not be 
notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In 
the statement, the borrower shall--
    (1) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent 
borrowed)--
    (i) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or 
after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;

[[Page 855]]

    (ii) Did not complete the program of study at that school because 
the school closed while the student was enrolled, or the student 
withdrew from the school not more than 90 days before the school closed 
(or longer in exceptional circumstances); and
    (iii) Did not complete the program of study through a teach-out at 
another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at 
the closed school to another school;
    (2) State whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with 
respect to the school's closing with any third party, such as the holder 
of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the 
amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited 
to the borrower's loan obligation; and
    (3) State that the borrower (or student)--
    (i) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other 
documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates 
that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this 
section; and
    (ii) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions 
in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and to transfer any 
right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance 
with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions. (1) In order to 
obtain a discharge under this section, a borrower shall cooperate with 
the Secretary in any judicial or administrative proceeding brought by 
the Secretary to recover amounts discharged or to take other enforcement 
action with respect to the conduct on which the discharge was based. At 
the request of the Secretary and upon the Secretary's tendering to the 
borrower the fees and costs that are customarily provided in litigation 
to reimburse witnesses, the borrower shall--
    (i) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the 
borrower to support a request for discharge;
    (ii) Produce any documents reasonably available to the borrower with 
respect to those representations; and
    (iii) If required by the Secretary, provide a sworn statement 
regarding those documents and representations.
    (2) The Secretary denies the request for a discharge or revokes the 
discharge of a borrower who--
    (i) Fails to provide the testimony, documents, or a sworn statement 
required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
    (ii) Provides testimony, documents, or a sworn statement that does 
not support the material representations made by the borrower to obtain 
the discharge.
    (e) Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery 
against third parties. (1) Upon discharge under this section, the 
borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in favor of the 
Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that 
the borrower (or student) may have by contract or applicable law with 
respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for the program for 
which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its 
affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any private fund, 
including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received 
from a private party.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding any 
provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those 
rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a transferee from 
exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of 
distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on 
those rights.
    (3) Nothing in this section limits or forecloses the borrower's (or 
student's) right to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes 
arising from matters unrelated to the discharged Direct Loan.
    (f) Discharge procedures. (1) After confirming the date of a 
school's closure, the Secretary identifies any Direct Loan borrower (or 
student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) who appears to have been 
enrolled at the school on the school closure date or to have withdrawn 
not more than 90 days prior to the closure date.

[[Page 856]]

    (2) If the borrower's current address is known, the Secretary mails 
the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the 
qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary 
also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any 
affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.
    (3) If the borrower's current address is unknown, the Secretary 
attempts to locate the borrower and determines the borrower's potential 
eligibility for a discharge under this section by consulting with 
representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, the 
school's accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. If the 
Secretary learns the new address of a borrower, the Secretary mails to 
the borrower a discharge application and explanation and suspends 
collection, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (4) If a borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of 
the Secretary's mailing the discharge application, the Secretary resumes 
collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the 
period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may 
capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (5) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a 
discharge meets the qualifications for a discharge, the Secretary 
notifies the borrower in writing of that determination.
    (6) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a 
discharge does not meet the qualifications for a discharge, the 
Secretary notifies that borrower in writing of that determination and 
the reasons for the determination.

<R05>
Sec. 685.215  Discharge for false certification of student eligibility or unauthorized payment.

    (a) Basis for discharge. (1) False certification. The Secretary 
discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a 
Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if a 
school falsely certifies the eligibility of the borrower (or the student 
on whose behalf a parent borrowed) to receive the loan. The Secretary 
considers a student's eligibility to borrow to have been falsely 
certified by the school if the school--
    (i) Certified the student's eligibility for a Direct Loan on the 
basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did not 
meet the eligibility requirements described in 34 CFR part 668 and 
section 484(d) of the Act, as applicable;
    (ii) Signed the borrower's name on the loan application or 
promissory note without the borrower's authorization; or
    (iii) Certified the eligibility of a student who, because of a 
physical or mental condition, age, criminal record, or other reason 
accepted by the Secretary, would not meet the requirements for 
employment (in the student's State of residence when the loan was 
originated) in the occupation for which the training program supported 
by the loan was intended.
    (2) Unauthorized payment. The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and 
any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan if the school, without 
the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or 
signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, 
unless the proceeds of the loan were delivered to the student or applied 
to charges owed by the student to the school.
    (b) Relief pursuant to discharge. (1) Discharge for false 
certification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section relieves the 
borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any 
accrued charges and collection costs with respect to the loan.

[[Page 857]]

    (2) Discharge for unauthorized payment under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section relieves the borrower of the obligation to repay the amount 
of the payment discharged.
    (3) The discharge under this section qualifies the borrower for 
reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection 
on the discharged loan or payment.
    (4) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a 
loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after 
discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under 
programs authorized by title IV of the Act.
    (5) The Secretary reports the discharge under this section to all 
credit reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the 
status of the loan.
    (c) Borrower qualification for discharge. In order to qualify for 
discharge under this section, the borrower shall submit to the Secretary 
a written request and a sworn statement, and the factual assertions in 
the statement must be true. The statement need not be notarized but must 
be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the 
borrower shall meet the requirements in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) 
of this section.
    (1) Ability to benefit. In the case of a borrower requesting a 
discharge based on defective testing of the student's ability to 
benefit, the borrower shall state that the borrower (or the student on 
whose behalf a parent borrowed)--
    (i) Received a disbursement of a loan, in whole or in part, on or 
after January 1, 1986 to attend a school; and
    (ii) Received a Direct Loan at that school on the basis of an 
ability to benefit from the school's training and did not meet the 
eligibility requirements described in 34 CFR part 668 and section 484(d) 
of the Act, as applicable;
    (2) Unauthorized loan. In the case of a borrower requesting a 
discharge because the school signed the borrower's name on the loan 
application or promissory note without the borrower's authorization, the 
borrower shall--
    (i) State that he or she did not sign the document in question or 
authorize the school to do so; and
    (ii) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two 
of which must be within one year before or after the date of the 
contested signature.
    (3) Unauthorized payment. In the case of a borrower requesting a 
discharge because the school, without the borrower's authorization, 
endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's 
authorization for electronic funds transfer, the borrower shall--
    (i) State that he or she did not endorse the loan check or sign the 
authorization for electronic funds transfer or authorize the school to 
do so;
    (ii) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two 
of which must be within one year before or after the date of the 
contested signature;
    (iii) State that the proceeds of the contested disbursement were not 
delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to 
the school.
    (4) Claim to third party. The borrower shall state whether the 
borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's 
false certification or unauthorized payment with any third party, such 
as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, 
if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) 
or credited to the borrower's loan obligation.
    (5) Cooperation with Secretary. The borrower shall state that the 
borrower (or student)--
    (i) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other 
documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates 
that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this 
section; and
    (ii) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions 
as described in Sec. 685.214(d) and to transfer any right to recovery 
against a third party to the Secretary as described in Sec. 685.214(e).
    (6) Discharge without an application. The Secretary may discharge a 
loan under this section without an application from the borrower if the 
Secretary determines, based on information in the Secretary's 
possession, that the borrower qualifies for a discharge.
    (d) Discharge procedures. (1) If the Secretary determines that a 
borrower's

[[Page 858]]

Direct Loan may be eligible for a discharge under this section, the 
Secretary mails the borrower a disclosure application and an explanation 
of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The 
Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the 
borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive 
borrower payments.
    (2) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of 
the Secretary's mailing the disclosure application, the Secretary 
resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for 
the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may 
capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (3) If the borrower submits the written request and sworn statement 
described in paragraph (c) of the section, the Secretary determines 
whether to grant a request for discharge under this section by reviewing 
the request and sworn statement in light of information available from 
the Secretary's records and from other sources, including guaranty 
agencies, State authorities, and cognizant accrediting associations.
    (4) If the Secretary determines that the borrower meets the 
applicable requirements for a discharge under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that 
determination.
    (5) If the Secretary determines that the borrower does not qualify 
for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that 
determination and the reasons for the determination.

Sec. 685.216  Unpaid refund discharge.

    (a)(1) Unpaid refunds in closed school situations. In the case of a 
school that has closed, the Secretary discharges a former or current 
borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of a 
Direct Loan equal to the refund that should have been made by the school 
under applicable law and regulations, including this section. Any 
accrued interest and other charges associated with the unpaid refund are 
also discharged.
    (2) Unpaid refunds in open school situations. (i) In the case of a 
school that is open, the Secretary discharges a former or current 
borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of a 
Direct Loan equal to the refund that should have been made by the school 
under applicable law and regulations, including this section, if--
    (A) The borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) 
is not attending the school that owes the refund;
    (B) The borrower has been unable to resolve the unpaid refund with 
the school; and
    (C) The Secretary is unable to resolve the unpaid refund with the 
school within 120 days from the date the borrower submits a complete 
application in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
regarding the unpaid refund. Any accrued interest and other charges 
associated with the unpaid refund are also discharged.
    (ii) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section, 
within 60 days of the date notified by the Secretary, the school must 
submit to the Secretary documentation demonstrating that the refund was 
made by the school or that the refund was not required to be made by the 
school.
    (b) Relief to borrower following discharge. (1) If the borrower 
receives a discharge of a portion of a loan under this section, the 
borrower is reimbursed for any amounts paid in excess of the remaining 
balance of the loan (including accrued interest and other charges) owed 
by the borrower at the time of discharge.
    (2) The Secretary reports the discharge of a portion of a loan under 
this section to all credit reporting agencies to which the Secretary 
previously reported the status of the loan.
    (c) Borrower qualification for discharge. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to receive a discharge of a portion of 
a loan under this

[[Page 859]]

section, a borrower must submit a written application to the Secretary. 
The application requests the information required to calculate the 
amount of the discharge and requires the borrower to sign a statement 
swearing to the accuracy of the information in the application. The 
statement need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under 
penalty of perjury. In the statement, the borrower must--
    (i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent 
borrowed)--
    (A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or 
after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;
    (B) Did not attend, withdrew, or was terminated from the school 
within a timeframe that entitled the borrower to a refund; and
    (C) Did not receive the benefit of a refund to which the borrower 
was entitled either from the school or from a third party, such as the 
holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program;
    (ii) State whether the borrower (or student) has any other 
application for discharge pending for this loan; and
    (iii) State that the borrower (or student)--
    (A) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other 
documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates 
that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this 
section; and
    (B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions as 
described in Sec. 685.214(d) and to transfer any right to recovery 
against a third party to the Secretary as described in Sec. 685.214(e).
    (2) The Secretary may discharge a portion of a loan under this 
section without an application if the Secretary determines, based on 
information in the Secretary's possession, that the borrower qualifies 
for a discharge.
    (d) Determination of amount eligible for discharge. (1) The 
Secretary determines the amount eligible for discharge based on 
information showing the refund amount or by applying the appropriate 
refund formula to information that the borrower provides or that is 
otherwise available to the Secretary. For purposes of this section, all 
unpaid refunds are considered to be attributed to loan proceeds.
    (2) If the information in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not 
available, the Secretary uses the following formulas to determine the 
amount eligible for discharge:
    (i) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal 
or termination date is before October 7, 2000 and who completes less 
than 60 percent of the loan period, the Secretary discharges the lesser 
of the institutional charges unearned or the loan amount. The Secretary 
determines the amount of the institutional charges unearned by--
    (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the 
loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual 
length of the loan period; and
    (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the institutional charges 
assessed the student for the loan period.
    (ii) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose 
withdrawal or termination date is on or after October 7, 2000 and who 
completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the Secretary 
discharges the loan amount unearned. The Secretary determines the loan 
amount unearned by--
    (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the 
loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual 
length of the loan period; and
    (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the total amount of title IV 
grants and loans received by the student, or, if unknown, the loan 
amount.
    (iii) In the case of a student who completes 60 percent or more of 
the loan period, the Secretary does not discharge any amount because a 
student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period is not 
entitled to a refund.
    (e) Discharge procedures. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, if the Secretary learns that a school did not make a 
refund of loan proceeds owed under applicable law and regulations, the 
Secretary sends the borrower a discharge application and an explanation 
of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The 
Secretary also promptly

[[Page 860]]

suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan. 
The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.
    (2) If a borrower who is sent a discharge application fails to 
submit the application within 60 days of the Secretary's sending the 
discharge application, the Secretary resumes collection and grants 
forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection 
activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest 
accrued and not paid during that period.
    (3) If a borrower qualifies for a discharge, the Secretary notifies 
the borrower in writing. The Secretary resumes collection and grants 
forbearance of principal and interest on the portion of the loan not 
discharged for the period in which collection activity was suspended. 
The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during 
that period.
    (4) If a borrower does not qualify for a discharge, the Secretary 
notifies the borrower in writing of the reasons for the determination. 
The Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and 
interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The 
Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that 
period.

Sec. 685.217  Teacher loan forgiveness program.

    (a) General. The teacher loan forgiveness program is intended to 
encourage individuals to enter and continue in the teaching profession. 
For new borrowers, the Secretary will repay up to a combined total of 
$5,000 of subsidized and unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Direct 
Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and, in certain cases, 
Federal Consolidation Loans or Direct Consolidation Loans. The 
forgiveness program is only available to a borrower who has no 
outstanding loan balance under the FFEL Program or the Direct Loan 
Program on October 1, 1998 or who has no outstanding loan balance on the 
date he or she obtains a loan after October l, 1998. In addition, the 
borrower must have been employed as a full-time teacher for five 
consecutive complete academic years, at least one of which was after the 
1997-1998 academic year, in certain eligible elementary or secondary 
schools that serve low-income families. The loan for which the borrower 
is seeking forgiveness must have been made prior to the end of the fifth 
year of qualifying teaching service.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:
    Academic year means one complete school year at the same school, or 
two complete and consecutive half years at different schools, or two 
complete and consecutive half years from different school years at 
either the same school or different schools. Half years exclude summer 
sessions and generally fall within a twelve-month period. For schools 
that have a year-round program of instruction, a minimum of nine months 
is considered an academic year.
    Elementary school means a public or nonprofit private school that 
provides elementary education as determined by State law or the 
Secretary if that school is not in a State.
    Full-time means the standard used by a State in defining full-time 
employment as a teacher. For a borrower teaching in more than one 
school, the determination of full-time is based on the combination of 
all qualifying employment.
    Secondary school means a public or nonprofit private school that 
provides secondary education as determined by State law or the Secretary 
if the school is not in a State.
    Teacher means a person who provides direct classroom teaching or 
classroom-type teaching in a non-classroom setting, including Special 
Education teachers.
    (c) Borrower eligibility. (1) A borrower may obtain loan forgiveness 
under this program if he or she has been employed as a full-time teacher 
for five consecutive complete academic years, at least one of which was 
after the 1997-1998 academic year, in an elementary or secondary school 
that--

[[Page 861]]

    (i) Is in a school district that qualifies for funds under title I 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended;
    (ii) Has been selected by the Secretary based on a determination 
that more than 30 percent of the school's total enrollment is made up of 
children who qualify for services provided under title I; and
    (iii) Is listed in the Annual Directory of Designated Low-Income 
Schools for Teacher Cancellation Benefits. If this directory is not 
available before May 1 of any year, the previous year's directory may be 
used.
    (2) If the school at which the borrower is employed meets the 
requirements specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for at least 
one year of the borrower's five consecutive complete academic years of 
teaching and the school failed to meet those requirements in subsequent 
years, those subsequent years of teaching qualify for purposes of this 
section for that borrower.
    (3) A borrower who is employed as an elementary school teacher must 
demonstrate knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, 
mathematics, and other areas of the elementary school curriculum, as 
certified by the chief administrative officer of the school in which the 
borrower was employed.
    (4) A borrower who is employed as a secondary school teacher must 
teach in a subject area that is relevant to the borrower's academic 
major as certified by the chief administrative officer of the school in 
which the borrower was employed.
    (5) The academic year may be counted as one of the borrower's five 
consecutive complete academic years if the borrower completes at least 
one-half of the academic year and the borrower's employer considers the 
borrower to have fulfilled his or her contract requirements for the 
academic year for the purposes of salary increases, tenure, and 
retirement if the borrower is unable to complete an academic year due 
to--
    (i) A return to postsecondary education, on at least a half-time 
basis, that is directly related to the performance of the service 
described in this section;
    (ii) A condition that is covered under the Family and Medical Leave 
Act of 1993 (FMLA) (19 U.S.C. 2654); or
    (iii) A call or order to active duty status for more than 30 days as 
a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces named in section 
10101 of title 10, United States Code.
    (6) If a borrower meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section, the borrower's period of postsecondary education, active duty, 
or qualifying FMLA condition including the time necessary for the 
borrower to resume qualifying teaching no later than the beginning of 
the next regularly scheduled academic year, does not constitute a break 
in the required five consecutive years of qualifying teaching service.
    (7) A borrower who teaches in more than one qualifying school during 
an academic year and demonstrates that the combined teaching was the 
equivalent of full-time, as supported by the certification of one or 
more of the chief administrative officers of the schools involved, is 
considered to have completed one academic year of qualifying teaching.
    (8) A borrower is not eligible for teacher loan forgiveness on a 
defaulted loan unless the borrower has made satisfactory repayment 
arrangements to re-establish title IV eligibility, as defined in 
Sec. 685.200(b).
    (9) A borrower may not receive loan forgiveness for qualifying 
teaching service under this section if the borrower receives a benefit 
for the same teaching service under subtitle D of title I of the 
National and Community Service Act of 1990.
    (d) Forgiveness amount. (1) A qualified borrower is eligible for 
forgiveness of up to $5,000 of the aggregate amount of a borrower's 
Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or Direct 
Consolidation Loan obligation that is outstanding after the borrower 
completes his or her fifth consecutive complete academic year of 
teaching as described in paragraph (c) of this section. Only the 
outstanding portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that was used

[[Page 862]]

to repay an eligible subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Stafford loan, 
an eligible Direct Subsidized Loan, or an eligible Direct Unsubsidized 
Loan qualifies for loan forgiveness under this section.
    (2) A borrower may not receive more than a total of $5,000 in loan 
forgiveness for outstanding principal and accrued interest under both 
this section and 34 CFR Sec. 682.215.
    (3) The Secretary does not refund payments that were received from 
or on behalf of a borrower who qualifies for loan forgiveness under this 
section.
    (e) Application. (1) A borrower, after completing the qualifying 
teacher service, must request loan forgiveness from the Secretary on a 
form provided by the Secretary.
    (2) If the Secretary determines that the borrower meets the 
eligibility requirements for loan forgiveness under this section, the 
Secretary--
    (i) Notifies the borrower of this determination; and
    (ii) Unless otherwise instructed by the borrower, applies the 
proceeds of the loan forgiveness first to any outstanding Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan balances, next to any outstanding Direct Subsidized 
Loan balances, next to any qualifying Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation 
Loan balances, and last to any qualifying outstanding Direct Subsidized 
Consolidation Loan balances.
    (3) If the Secretary determines that the borrower does not meet the 
eligibility requirements for loan forgiveness under this section, the 
Secretary notifies the borrower of this determination.

joint Direct Consolidation Loan and the borrower's spouse does not meet 
the requirements for any type of discharge described in Sec. 685.212, 
the Secretary discharges a portion of the consolidation loan equal to 
the amount of the loan that would have been eligible for discharge under 
the provisions of Sec. 685.212(d), (e), or (f) as applicable.

expected family contribution of the student for that year;
    (3) Certify that the amount of the loan for any student under part D 
of the Act is not in excess of the annual limit applicable for that loan 
program and that the amount of the loan, in combination with previous 
loans received by the borrower, is not in excess of the aggregate limit 
for that loan program;
    (4) Set forth a schedule for disbursement of the proceeds of the 
loan in installments, consistent with the requirements of section 428G

of which the school becomes aware for

[[Page 866]]

these students (or their parents) after the student leaves the school; 
and
    (iii) Concerning student eligibility and need, for the alternative 
origination of loans to eligible students and parents in accordance with 
part D of the Act;
    (6) Provide assurances that the school will comply with requirements 
established by the Secretary relating to student loan information with 
respect to loans made under the Direct Loan Program;
    (7) Provide that the school will accept responsibility and financial 
liability stemming from its failure to perform its functions pursuant to 
the agreement;
    (8) Provide that eligible students at the school and their parents 
may participate in the programs under part B of the Act at the 
discretion of the Secretary for the period during which the school 
participates in the Direct Loan Program under part D of the Act, except 
that a student may not receive loans under both part D of the Act and 
part B of the Act for the same period of enrollment and a parent 
(borrowing for the same student) may not receive loans under both part D 
of the Act and part B of the Act for the same period of enrollment;
    (9) Provide for the implementation of a quality assurance system, as 
established by the Secretary and developed in consultation with the 
school, to ensure that the school is complying with program requirements 
and meeting program objectives;

associated with such a loan; and
    (11) Comply with other provisions that the Secretary determines are 
necessary to protect the interests of the United States and to promote 
the purposes of part D of the Act.
    (c) Origination. (1) If a school or consortium originates loans in 
the Direct Loan Program, it shall enter into a supplemental agreement

eligible students and parents in accordance with part D of the Act; and
    (ii) Provides that the note or evidence of obligation on the loan is 
the property of the Secretary.

    (ii) The documentation supporting the determination is retained in 
the student's file; and
    (iii) The school does not engage in any pattern or practice that

Sec. 685.303  Processing loan proceeds.

    (a) Purpose. This section establishes rules governing a school's 
processing of a borrower's Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or 
Direct PLUS Loan proceeds. The school shall also comply with any rules 
for processing loan proceeds contained in 34 CFR part 668.
    (b) General--(1)(i) A school that initiates the drawdown of funds. A 
school may not disburse loan proceeds to a borrower unless the school 
has obtained an executed, legally enforceable promissory note from the 
borrower.
    (ii) A school that does not initiate the drawdown of funds. A school 
may disburse loan proceeds only to a borrower for whom the school has 
received funds from the Secretary.
    (2)(i) Except in the case of a late disbursement under paragraph (d) 
of this section, or as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this 
section, a school may disburse loan proceeds only to a student, or a 
parent in the case of a PLUS Loan, if the school determines the student 
has continuously maintained eligibility in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 685.200 from the beginning of the loan period 
described in the promissory note.
    (ii) In the event a student delays attending school for a period of 
time, the school may consider that student to have maintained 
eligibility for the loan from the first day of the period of enrollment. 
However, the school must comply with the requirements under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section.
    (iii) If, after a school makes the first disbursement to a borrower, 
the student becomes ineligible due solely to the school's loss of 
eligibility to participate in the title IV programs or the Direct Loan 
Program, the school may make subsequent disbursements to the borrower as 
permitted by 34 CFR part 668.
    (iv) If, prior to making any disbursement to a borrower, the student 
temporarily ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, the 
school may make a disbursement and any subsequent disbursement to the 
student if the school determines and documents in the student's file--
    (A) That the student has resumed enrollment on at least a half-time 
basis;
    (B) The student's revised cost of attendance; and
    (C) That the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of 
the loan, notwithstanding any reduction in the student's cost of 
attendance caused by the student's temporary cessation of enrollment on 
at least a half-time basis.
    (3) If a registered student withdraws or is expelled prior to the 
first day of classes of the period of enrollment for which the loan is 
made, or fails to attend school during that period, or if the school is 
unable for any other reason to document that the student attended school 
during that period, the school shall notify the Secretary, within 30 
days of the date described in Sec. 685.305(a), of the student's 
withdrawal, expulsion, or failure to attend school, as applicable, and 
return to the Secretary--

[[Page 870]]

    (i) Any loan proceeds credited by the school to the student's 
account; and
    (ii) The amount of payments made by the student to the school, to 
the extent that they do not exceed the amount of any loan proceeds 
disbursed by the school to the student.
    (4)(i) If a student is enrolled in the first year of an 
undergraduate program of study and has not previously received a Federal 
Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students, Direct Subsidized, or 
Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a school may not disburse the proceeds of a 
Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan until 30 days after the 
first day of the student's program of study unless--
    (A) The school has a cohort default rate, calculated under subpart M 
of 34 CFR part 668, or weighted average cohort rate of less than 10 
percent for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data 
are available;
    (B) The school is an eligible home institution originating a loan to 
cover the cost of attendance in a study abroad program and has a Direct 
Loan Program cohort rate, FFEL cohort default rate, or weighted average 
cohort rate of less than 5 percent for the single most recent fiscal 
year for which data are available; or
    (C) The school is not in a State.
    (ii) Paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section does not apply to any 
loans originated by the school beginning--
    (A) 30 days after the date the school receives notification from the 
Secretary of a cohort default rate, calculated under subpart M of 34 CFR 
part 668, that causes the school to no longer meet the qualifications 
outlined in that paragraph; or
    (B) October 1, 2002.
    (iii) Paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section does not apply to any 
loans originated by the school beginning 30 days after the date the 
school receives notification from the Secretary of a cohort default 
rate, calculated under Subpart M of 34 CFR part 668, that causes the 
school to no longer meet the qualifications outlined in that paragraph.
    (c) Processing of the proceeds of a Direct Loan. Schools shall 
follow the procedures for disbursing funds in 34 CFR 668.164.
    (d) Late Disbursement. A school may make a late disbursement 
according to the provisions found under 34 CFR 668.164(g).
    (e) Treatment of excess loan proceeds. Before the disbursement of 
any Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan proceeds, if a school 
learns that the borrower will receive or has received financial aid for 
the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended that exceeds 
the amount of assistance for which the student is eligible (except for 
Federal Work-Study Program funds up to $300), the school shall reduce or 
eliminate the overaward by either--
    (1) Using the student's Direct Unsubsidized, Direct PLUS, or State-
sponsored or another non-Federal loan to cover the expected family 
contribution, if not already done; or
    (2) Reducing one or more subsequent disbursements to eliminate the 
overaward.

Sec. 685.304  Counseling borrowers.

    (a) Initial counseling. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section, a school must conduct initial counseling prior to 
making the first disbursement of the proceeds of a Direct Subsidized or 
Direct Unsubsidized Loan to a borrower unless the student borrower has 
received a prior Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, Federal 
Stafford, Federal Unsubsidized Stafford, or Federal SLS Loan.
    (2) The counseling must be in person, by audiovisual presentation, 
or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the school must ensure 
that an individual with knowledge of the title IV programs is reasonably 
available shortly after the counseling to answer the student borrower's 
questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student borrower enrolled 
in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program approved for 
credit at the home institution, the school may provide the student 
borrower with written counseling

[[Page 871]]

materials prior to disbursing the loan proceeds.
    (3) In conducting the initial counseling, the school must--
    (i) Explain the use of a Master Promissory Note;
    (ii) Emphasize to the borrower the seriousness and importance of the 
repayment obligation the student borrower is assuming;
    (iii) Describe in forceful terms the likely consequences of default, 
including adverse credit reports, garnishment of wages, and litigation;
    (iv) Provide the student borrower with general information with 
respect to the average indebtedness of student borrowers who have 
obtained Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loans for attendance 
at that school or in the student borrower's program of study;
    (v) Inform the student borrower as to the average anticipated 
monthly repayment for those student borrowers based on the average 
indebtedness provided under paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (4) A school may adopt an alternative approach for initial 
counseling as part of the school's quality assurance plan described in 
Sec. 685.300(b)(9). If a school adopts an alternative approach, it is 
not required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)-(3) of this 
section unless the Secretary determines that the alternative approach is 
not adequate for the school. The alternative approach must--
    (i) Ensure that each student borrower subject to initial counseling 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is provided written counseling 
materials that contain the information described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section;
    (ii) Be designed to target those student borrowers who are most 
likely to default on their repayment obligations and provide them more 
intensive counseling and support services; and
    (iii) Include performance measures that demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the school's alternative approach. These performance 
measures must include objective outcomes, such as levels of borrowing, 
default rates, and withdrawal rates.
    (5) A school that conducts initial counseling through interactive 
electronic means must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student 
borrower receives the counseling materials, and participates in and 
completes initial counseling.
    (6) The school must maintain documentation substantiating the 
school's compliance with this section for each student borrower.
    (b) Exit counseling. (1) A school must conduct exit counseling with 
each Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower shortly 
before the student borrower ceases at least half-time study at the 
school.
    (2) The counseling must be in person, by audiovisual presentation, 
or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the school must ensure 
that an individual with knowledge of the title IV programs is reasonably 
available shortly after the counseling to answer the student borrower's 
questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student borrower enrolled 
in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program approved for 
credit at the home institution, the school may provide the student 
borrower with written counseling materials within 30 days after the 
student borrower completes the program.
    (3) If a student borrower withdraws from school without the school's 
prior knowledge or fails to complete the exit counseling as required, 
the school must provide exit counseling either through interactive 
electronic means or by mailing written counseling materials to the 
student borrower at the student borrower's last known address within 30 
days after the school learns that the student borrower has withdrawn 
from school or failed to complete the exit counseling as required.
    (4) In conducting the exit counseling, the school must--
    (i) Inform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly 
repayment amount based on the student borrower's indebtedness or on the 
average indebtedness of student borrowers who have obtained Direct 
Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loans for attendance at that school or 
in the student borrower's program of study;
    (ii) Review for the student borrower available repayment options 
including

[[Page 872]]

the standard repayment, extended repayment, graduated repayment, and 
income contingent repayment plans, and loan consolidation;
    (iii) Provide options to the student borrower concerning those debt-
management strategies that the school determines would facilitate 
repayment by the student borrower;
    (iv) Explain to the student borrower how to contact the party 
servicing the student borrower's Direct Loans;
    (v) Meet the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section;
    (vi) Review with the student borrower the conditions under which the 
student borrower may defer repayment or obtain a full or partial 
cancellation of a loan;
    (vii) Review with the student borrower information on the 
availability of the Department's Student Loan Ombudsman's office; and
    (viii) Require the student borrower to provide corrections to the 
school's records concerning name, address, social security number, 
references, and driver's license number and State of issuance, as well 
as the student borrower's expected permanent address, the address of the 
student borrower's next of kin, and the name and address of the student 
borrower's expected employer (if known). The school must provide this 
information to the Secretary within 60 days.
    (5) A school that conducts exit counseling through interactive 
electronic means must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student 
borrower receives the counseling materials, and participates in and 
completes exit counseling.
    (6) The school must maintain documentation substantiating the 
school's compliance with this section for each student borrower.

Sec. 690.8  Enrollment status for students taking regular and correspondence courses.

    (a) If, in addition to regular coursework, a student takes 
correspondence courses from either his or her own institution or another 
institution having an agreement for this purpose with the student's 
institution, the correspondence work may be included in determining the 
student's enrollment status to the extent permitted under paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
correspondence work that may be included in determining a student's 
enrollment status is that amount of work which--
    (1) Applies toward a student's degree or certificate or is remedial 
work taken by the student to help in his or her course of study;
    (2) Is completed within the period of time required for regular 
course work; and
    (3) does not exceed the amount of a student's regular course work 
for the payment period for which the student's enrollment status is 
being calculated.
    (c)(1) Notwithstanding the limitation in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, a student who would be a half-time student based solely on his 
or her correspondence work is considered a half-time student unless the 
calculation in paragraph (b) of this section produces an enrollment 
status greater than half-time.
    (2) A student who would be a less-than-half-time student based 
solely on his or her correspondence work or a combination of 
correspondence work and regular course work is considered a less-than-
half-time student.
    (d) The following chart provides examples of the rules set forth in 
this section. It assumes that the institution defines full-time 
enrollment as 12 credits per term, making the half-time enrollment equal 
to 6 credits per term.

Payment Schedule;
    (2) Multiplying the amount determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section by the lesser of--

section by--
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.032

    (f) A single disbursement may not exceed 50 percent of any award 
determined under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section. If a payment for 
a payment period calculated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section 
would require the disbursement of more than 50 percent of a student's 
annual award in that payment period, the institution shall make at least 
two disbursements to the student in that payment period. The institution 
may not disburse an amount that exceeds 50 percent of the student's 
annual award until the student has completed the period of time in the 
payment period that equals, in terms of weeks of instructional time, 50 
percent of the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic 
year.
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section and 34 CFR 668.66, the amount of a student's award for an award 
year may not exceed his or her Scheduled Federal Pell Grant award for 
that award year except as provided in Sec. 690.67.
    (2) For purposes of this section and Sec. 690.66, an institution 
must define an academic year for each of its eligible programs in terms 
of the number of credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time 
in accordance with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.2 and 668.3.

Sec. 690.65  Transfer student: attendance at more than one institution during an award year.

    (a) If a student who receives a Federal Pell Grant at one 
institution subsequently enrolls at a second institution in the same 
award year, the student may receive a Federal Pell Grant at the second 
institution only if--
    (1) The student submits a valid SAR to the second institution; or
    (2) The second institution obtains a valid ISIR.
    (b) The second institution shall calculate the student's award 
according to Sec. 690.63.
    (c) The second institution may pay a Federal Pell Grant only for 
that portion of the academic year in which a student is enrolled at that 
institution. The grant amount must be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure 
that the grant does not exceed the student's Scheduled Federal Pell 
Grant for that award year except as provided under Sec. 690.67.
    (d) If a student's Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the second 
institution differs from the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the first 
institution, the grant amount at the second institution is calculated as 
follows--
    (1) The amount received at the first institution is compared to the 
Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the first institution to determine the 
percentage of the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant that the student has 
received.
    (2) That percentage is subtracted from 100 percent.
    (3) The remaining percentage is the percentage of the Scheduled 
Federal Pell Grant at the second institution to which the student is 
entitled.
    (e) The student's Federal Pell Grant for each payment period is 
calculated according to the procedures in Sec. 690.63 unless the 
remaining percentage of the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the second 
institution, referred to in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, is less 
than the amount the student would normally receive for that payment 
period. In that case, the student's Federal Pell Grant is equal to that 
remaining percentage.
    (f) A transfer student shall repay any amount received in an award 
year that exceeds--
    (1) His or her Scheduled Federal Pell Grant; or
    (2) The amount which he or she was eligible to receive for the award 
year under Sec. 690.67.

Sec. 690.66  Correspondence study.

    (a) An institution calculates the Federal Pell Grant for a payment 
period for a student in a program of study offered by correspondence 
courses without terms, but not including any residential component by--

Disbursement Schedule;
    (2) Determining the length of the correspondence program in weeks of 
instructional time by--
    (i) Preparing a written schedule for submission of lessons that 
reflect a workload of at least 12 hours of preparation per week; and
    (ii) Determining the number of weeks of instructional time in the 
program of study using the written schedule for submission of lessons;
    (3) Multiplying the annual award determined from the Disbursement 
Schedule for a half-time student by the lesser of--

    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section--
    (1) An academic year as measured in credit hours must consist of 2 
payment periods--
    (i) The first payment period must be the period of time in which the 
student completes the lesser of the first half of his or her academic 
year or program; and
    (ii) The second payment period must be the period of time in which 
the student completes the lesser of the second half of the academic year 
or program; and
    (2)(i) The institution shall make the first payment to a student for 
an academic year, as calculated under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
after the student submits 25 percent of the lessons or otherwise 
completes 25 percent of the work scheduled for the program or the 
academic year, whichever occurs last; and
    (ii) The institution shall make the second payment to a student for 
an academic year, as calculated under (a)(4) of this section, after the 
student submits 75 percent of the lessons or otherwise completes 75 
percent of the work scheduled for the program or the academic year, 
whichever occurs last.
    (c) In a program of correspondence study offered by correspondence 
courses using terms but not including any residential component--
    (1) The institution must prepare a written schedule for submission 
of lessons that reflects a workload of at least 30 hours of preparation 
per semester hour or 20 hours of preparation per quarter hour during the 
term;
    (2)(i) If the student is enrolled in at least 6 credit hours that 
commence and are completed in that term, the Disbursement Schedule for a 
half-time student is used; or
    (ii) If the student is enrolled in less than 6 credit hours that 
commence and are completed in that term the Disbursement Schedule for a 
less-than-half-time student is used;
    (3) A payment for a payment period is calculated using the formula 
in Sec. 690.63(d) except that paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section 
are used in lieu of Sec. 690.63(d) (1) and (2) respectively; and
    (4) The institution shall make the payment to a student for a 
payment period after that student completes 50 percent of the lessons or 
otherwise completes 50 percent of the work scheduled for the term, 
whichever occurs last.
    (d) Payments for periods of residential training shall be calculated 
under Sec. 690.63(d) if the residential training is offered using terms 
and credit hours or Sec. 690.63(e) if the residential training is 
offered using credit hours without terms.

    (c) Change in cost of attendance. If the student's cost of 
attendance changes at any time during the award year and his or her 
enrollment status remains the same, the institution may (but is not 
required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the 
payment period is recalculated. If such a policy is established, it must 
apply to all students.

[[Page 891]]

    (3) An institution that does not comply with the requirements of 
this paragraph may receive a payment or reduction in accountability only 
as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b)(1) An institution shall report to the Secretary any change in 
enrollment status, cost of attendance, or other event or condition that 
causes a change in the amount of a Federal Pell Grant for which a 
student qualifies by submitting to the Secretary the student's Payment 
Data that discloses the basis and result of the change in award for each 
student. Through publication in the Federal Register, the Secretary 
divides the award year into periods and establishes the deadlines by 
which the institution shall report changes occurring during each period. 
The institution shall submit the student's Payment Data reporting a 
change to the Secretary by the end of that reporting period that next 
follows the reporting period in which the change occurred.
    (2) An institution shall submit in accordance with deadline dates 
established by the Secretary, through publication in the Federal 
Register, other reports and information the Secretary requires in 
connection with the funds advanced to it and shall comply with the 
procedures the Secretary finds necessary to ensure that the reports are 
correct.
    (3) An institution that timely submits, and has accepted by the 
Secretary, the Payment Data for a student in accordance with this 
section shall report a reduction in the amount of a Federal Pell Grant 
award that the student received when it determines that an overpayment 
has occurred, unless that overpayment is one for which the institution 
is not liable under Sec. 690.79(a).
    (c) In accordance with 34 CFR 668.84 the Secretary may impose a fine 
on the institution if the institution fails to comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, if an 
institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the 
institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with this 
part but has not received credit or payment for those grants, the 
institution may receive payment or a reduction in accountability for 
those grants in accordance with paragraphs (d)(4) and either (d)(2) or 
(d)(3) of this section.
    (2) The institution must demonstrate that it qualifies for a credit 
or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit report of an 
award year that was the first audit of that award year and that was 
conducted after December 31, 1988 and timely submitted to the Secretary 
under 34 CFR 668.23(c).
    (3) An institution that timely submits the Payment Data for a 
student in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section but does not 
timely submit to the Secretary, or have accepted by the Secretary, the 
Payment Data necessary to document the full amount of the award to which 
the student is entitled, may receive a payment or reduction in 
accountability in the full amount of that award, if--
    (i) A program review demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that the student was eligible to receive an amount greater 
than that reported in the student's Payment Data timely submitted to, 
and accepted by the Secretary; and
    (ii) The institution seeks an adjustment to reflect an underpayment 
for that award that is at least $100.
    (4) In determining whether the institution qualifies for a payment 
or reduction in accountability, the Secretary takes into account any 
liabilities of the institution arising from that audit or program review 
or any other source. The Secretary collects those liabilities by offset 
in accordance with 34 CFR part 30.

        What Is the Amount of Assistance and How May It Be Used?


<R05>
Sec. 692.10  How does the Secretary allot funds to the States?

    (a)(1) The Secretary allots to each State participating in the LEAP 
program an amount which bears the same ratio to the Federal LEAP funds 
appropriated as the number of students in that State who are ``deemed 
eligible'' to participate in the State's LEAP program bears to the total 
number of students in all States who are ``deemed eligible'' to 
participate in the LEAP program, except that no State may receive less 
than it received in fiscal year 1979.
    (2) If the Federal LEAP funds appropriated for a fiscal year are not 
sufficient to allot to each State the amount of Federal LEAP funds it 
received in fiscal year 1979, the Secretary allots to each State an 
amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of Federal LEAP funds 
appropriated as the amount of Federal LEAP funds that State received in 
fiscal year 1979 bears to the amount of Federal LEAP funds all States 
received in fiscal year 1979.
    (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary determines the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to 
participate in a State's LEAP Program by dividing the amount of that 
State's LEAP expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the 
State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant 
award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines 
the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of 
student recipients for all States into

[[Page 894]]

the total amount of LEAP expenditures for all States, including both the 
Federal allotments and the State-appropriated funds matching those 
allotments. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most 
current available data reported by each State.

<R05>
Sec. 692.11  For what purposes may a State use its payments under the LEAP Program?

make grants to students and to pay wages or salaries to students in 
community service-learning jobs.

<R05>
Sec. 692.20  What must a State do to receive an allotment under this program?

    (a) For each fiscal year that it wishes to participate, a State 
shall submit an application that contains information that shows that 
its Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program meets the 
requirements of Sec. 692.21.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
State must submit its application through the State agency designated to 
administer its Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program as 
of July 1, 1985.
    (2) If the Governor of the State so designates, and notifies the 
Secretary in writing, the State may submit its application under 
paragraph (a) of this section through an agency that did not administer 
its Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program as of July 1, 
1985.

<R05>
Sec. 692.21  What requirements must be met by a State program?

    To receive a payment under the LEAP Program for any fiscal year, a 
State must have a program that--

is payable to an organization other than the State for the purpose of 
collecting data to make a determination of financial need in accordance 
with paragraph (d) of this section;
    (f) Provides that all public or private nonprofit institutions of

awarded to those students;
    (h) Provides that--
    (1) The State will pay an amount for grants and work-study jobs 
under this part for each fiscal year that is not less than the payment 
to the State under this part for that fiscal year; and
    (2) The amount that the State expends during a fiscal year for 
grants and work-study jobs under the LEAP Program represents an 
additional amount for grants and work-study jobs for students attending 
institutions over the amount expended by the State for those activities 
during the fiscal

[[Page 895]]

year two years prior to the fiscal year in which the State first 
received funds under the LEAP Program;
    (i) Provides for State expenditures under the State program of an 
amount that is not less than--
    (1) The average annual aggregate expenditures for the preceding 
three fiscal years; or
    (2) The average annual expenditure per full-time equivalent student 
for those years;
    (j) Provides that, to the extent practicable, the proportion of the 
funds awarded to independent students in the LEAP Program shall be the 
same proportion of funds awarded to independent students as is in the 
State program or programs of which the State's LEAP Program is a part; 
and
    (k) Provides for reports to the Secretary that are necessary to 
carry out the Secretary's functions under the LEAP Program.

the resources available to meet that cost. To determine substantial 
need, the State may use--
    (1) A system for determining a student's financial need under part F 
of title IV of the HEA;
    (2) The State's own needs analysis system if approved by the 
Secretary; or
    (3) A combination of these systems, if approved by the Secretary.
    (b) The Secretary generally approves a need-analysis system under 
paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section only if the need-analysis 
system applies the term ``independent student'' as defined under section 
480(d) of the HEA. However, for good cause shown, the Secretary may 
approve, on a case-by-case basis, a State's need analysis system that 
uses a definition for ``independent student'' that varies from that term 
as defined in section 480(d) of the HEA.

    The Director may, through a notice published in the Federal 
Register, select annually one or more priorities for funding. These 
priorities may be chosen from the areas of greatest immediate concern to 
the Institute and may include, but are not limited to, the following 
areas:
    (a) Developing leadership in adult learners. Because adult learners 
are the true experts on literacy, they are an important resource for the 
field. Their firsthand experience as ``customers'' of the literacy 
system can be invaluable in assisting the field in moving forward, 
particularly in terms of raising public awareness and understanding 
about literacy.
    (b) Expanding the use of technology in literacy programs. One of the 
Institute's major projects is the Literacy Information aNd Communication 
System (LINCS), an Internet-based information system that provides 
timely information and abundant resources to the literacy community. 
Keeping the literacy community up to date in the Information Age is 
vital.
    (c) Improving accountability for literacy programs. Literacy 
programs must develop accountability systems that demonstrate their 
effectiveness in helping adult learners contribute more fully in the 
workplace, family and community. There is growing interest in results-
oriented literacy practice, especially as related to the Equipped for 
the Future (EFF) framework.
    (d) Raising public awareness about literacy. The Institute is 
leading a national effort to raise public awareness that literacy is 
part of the solution to many social concerns, including health, welfare, 
the economy, and the well-being of children. Projects that enhance this 
effort will be given priority consideration.

response to an application notice published by the Director in the 
Federal Register. The application must describe a plan for one or more 
of the activities stated in Sec. 1100.3 that the applicant proposes to 
conduct under the fellowship. The application must indicate which 
category of fellowship, as described in Sec. 1100.10, most accurately 
describes the applicant. Applicants must also submit for letters for 
recommendation and certain forms, assurances and certifications, 
including the certification required under 34 CFR 75.61. For applicants 
who propose to conduct the fellowship project on a part-time basis while 
undertaking other paid employment, one of the four required letters of 
recommendation must be from the applicant's employer, and must include a 
statement that the applicant's workload will not exceed 100 percent of

791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1614, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Secs. 1200.141-1200.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1200.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1200.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that result in such an 
alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings,

[[Page 949]]

shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the 
Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), 
and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods 
for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give 
priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to 
qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting 
appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 1200.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec. 1200.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Secs. 1200.152-1200.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices

[[Page 950]]

for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems 
shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1200.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and
