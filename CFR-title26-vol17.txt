                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

  Editorial Note: IRS published a document at 45 FR 6088, Jan. 25, 1980, 
deleting statutory sections from their regulations. In chapter I cross 
references to the deleted material have been changed to the 
corresponding sections of the IRS Code of 1954 or to the appropriate 
regulations sections. When either such change produced a redundancy, the 
cross reference has been deleted. For further explanation, see 45 FR

<R05>
Sec. 301.6011-2  Required use of magnetic media.

    (a) Meaning of terms. The following definitions apply for purposes 
of this section:
    (1) Magnetic media. The term ``magnetic media'' means any magnetic 
media permitted under applicable regulations, revenue procedures, or, in 
the

[[Page 17]]

case of returns filed with the Social Security Administration, Social 
Security Administration publications. These generally include magnetic 
tape, diskette, cassette, and mini-disk, as well as other media 
specifically permitted under the applicable regulations or procedures. 
Use of diskette and cassette may be subject to certain limitations or 
special rules in the case of returns required on Form W-2 or W-2P.
    (2) Machine-readable paper form. The term ``machine-readable paper 
form'' means--
    (i) Optical-scan paper form; or
    (ii) Any other machine-readable paper form permitted under 
applicable regulations, revenue procedures, or Social Security 
Administration publications.
    (3) Person. The term ``person'' includes any person that is required 
to file a return that is described in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Thus, the term ``person'' includes the United States, a State, the 
District of Columbia, a foreign government, a political subdivision of a 
State or of a foreign government, or an international organization. In 
addition, in the case of an affiliated group of corporations filing a 
consolidated return, each member of the affiliated group is a separate 
person.
    (b) Returns required on magnetic media. (1) If the use of Form 
1042S, 1098, 1099 series, 5498, 6248, 8027, W-2G, or other form treated 
as a form specified in this paragraph (b)(1) is required by the 
applicable regulations or revenue procedures for the purpose of making a 
return, the information required by such form shall, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, be submitted on magnetic 
media. Returns on magnetic media shall be made in accordance with 
applicable revenue procedures. Pursuant to these procedures, the consent 
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (or other authorized officer or 
employee of the Internal Revenue Service) to a magnetic medium shall be 
obtained prior to submitting a return on such magnetic medium. An 
application for such consent shall be in writing and must be filed at 
least 90 days before the filing of the first return for which consent is 
requested.
    (2) If the use of Form W-2, W-2P, or other form treated as a form 
specified in this paragraph (b)(2) is required by the regulations or 
revenue procedures for the purpose of making a return (not including the 
copy of Form W-2 or W-2P that is required to be attached to an 
Individual Income Tax Return), the information required by such form 
shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, be 
submitted on magnetic media. Returns on magnetic media shall be made in 
accordance with applicable Social Security Administration procedures. 
Thus, the consent of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (or 
other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Health and 
Human Services) to a magnetic medium shall be obtained prior to 
submitting a return on such magnetic medium. An application for such 
consent shall be in writing and must be filed--
    (i) On or before July 31, 1986, in the case of returns filed in 
1987;
    (ii) On or before June 30, 1987, in the case of returns filed in 
1988; and
    (iii) At least 90 days before the filing of the first return for 
which consent is requested in all other cases.
    (3) The Commissioner may prescribe by revenue procedure that 
additional forms are treated, for purposes of this section, as forms 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions--(1) Low-volume filers--(i) In general. A person 
required to make returns on a particular type of form specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section (other than Form 1099-DIV, 1099-PATR, 
1099-INT, or 1099-OID) may make such returns on the prescribed paper 
form for a calendar year or other applicable annual period (whether such 
returns are filed during the calendar year or annual period or during 
the subsequent calendar year or annual period) if--
    (A) In the case of a calendar year or annual period beginning before 
January 1, 1987--
    (1) On the first day of such calendar year or annual period the 
person reasonably expects to file fewer than 500 returns on such form 
for the calendar year or annual period; and
    (2) The person was not required to file 500 or more returns on such 
form

[[Page 18]]

for the preceding calendar year or annual period; or
    (B) In the case of a calendar year or annual period beginning on or 
after January 1, 1987--
    (1) On the first day of such calendar year or annual period the 
person reasonably expects to file fewer than 250 returns on such form 
for the calendar year or annual period; and
    (2) The person was not required to file 250 or more returns on such 
form for the preceding calendar year or annual period.

Alternatively, such persons may make returns on magnetic media in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Machine-readable forms. Returns made on a paper form under this 
paragraph (c)(1) shall be machine-readable if applicable revenue 
procedures provide for a machine-readable paper form.
    (iii) Form 1099 series. Each form within the Form 1099 series is 
considered a separate type of form for purposes of this paragraph 
(c)(1). Thus, for example, in the case of a calendar year beginning on 
or after January 1, 1987, if on the first day of such calendar year a 
person reasonably expects to file 200 returns on Form 1099-A and 150 
returns on Form 1099-MISC and for the preceding calendar year the person 
was required to file 200 returns on Form 1099-A and 150 returns on Form 
1099-MISC, the person may make such returns on the prescribed paper form 
for such calendar year.
    (2) Special rule for Form 1099-DIV, 1099-PATR, 1099-INT, 1099-OID--
(i) 50 or fewer returns. A person required to make returns on Form 1099-
DIV, 1099-PATR, 1099-INT, or 1099-OID may make such returns on a 
machine-readable paper form for a calendar year if--
    (A) On the first day of such calendar year the person reasonably 
expects to file 50 or fewer returns on such forms for the calendar year; 
and
    (B) The person was not required to file more than 50 returns on such 
forms for the preceding calendar year. Alternatively, such persons may 
make returns on magnetic media in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section
    (ii) Aggregation of returns. For purposes of determining the number 
of returns that a person was required to file or reasonably expects to 
file on Form 1099-DIV, 1099-PATR, 1099-INT, or 1099-OID, all such 
returns shall be aggregated. Thus, for example, if a person filed 30 
returns on Form 1099-INT and 30 returns on Form 1099-DIV for a calendar 
year, or reasonably expects to do so for the succeeding calendar year, 
all returns made by such person on Form 1099-DIV, 1099-PATR, 1099-INT 
and 1099-OID for the succeeding calendar year must be on magnetic media.
    (3) Provided by regulations--(i) In general. This section does not 
apply to a return if the regulations relating to such return require 
reporting on magnetic media.
    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
the rule in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section:

    Example. Section 1.6045-1(l), relating to returns of information of 
brokers and barter exchanges, requires the use of magnetic media as the 
method of reporting. Thus, this section does not apply to returns 
required to be filed under section 6045.

    (4) Waiver. (i) The Commissioner may waive the requirements of this 
section if hardship is shown in a request for waiver filed in accordance 
with this paragraph (c)(4)(i). The principal factor in determining 
hardship will be the amount, if any, by which the cost of filing the 
information returns in accordance with this section exceeds the cost of 
filing the returns on other media. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if an 
employer is required to make a final return on Form 941, or a variation 
thereof, and expedited filing of Forms W-2 is required, the 
unavailability of specifications for magnetic media filing will be 
treated as creating a hardship. See Sec. 31.6071(a)-1(a)(3)(ii). A 
request for waiver should be filed at least 45 days before the due date 
of the information return in order for the Service to have adequate time 
to respond to the request for waiver. The waiver will specify the type 
of information return and the period to which it applies and will be 
subject to such terms and conditions regarding the method of reporting 
as may be prescribed by the Commissioner.
    (ii) The Commissioner may by revenue procedure prescribe rules that 
supplement the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

[[Page 19]]

    (d) Paper form returns. Returns submitted on paper forms (whether or 
not machine-readable) permitted under paragraph (c) of this section 
shall be made in accordance with applicable revenue or Social Security 
Administration procedures.
    (e) Applicability of current procedures. Until procedures are 
prescribed which further implement the mandatory filing on magnetic 
media provided by this section, a return to which this section applies 
shall be made in the manner and shall be subject to the requirements and 
conditions (including the requirement of applying for consent to the 
magnetic medium) prescribed in the regulations, revenue procedures and 
Social Security Administration publications relating to the filing of 
such return on magnetic media. In addition, consent to the use of a 
magnetic medium obtained in accordance with such regulations, revenue 
procedures and Social Security Administration publications (regardless 
of when obtained) will be considered consent to the use of such medium 
for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Failure to file. If a person fails to file a return on magnetic 
media when required to do so by section 6011(e) and this section, such 
person is deemed to have failed to file the return. In addition, if a 
person making returns on a paper form under paragraph (c) of this 
section for a calendar year (or annual filing period) beginning after 
December 31, 1986, fails to file a return on a machine-readable paper 
form when required to do so by this section, such person is deemed to 
have failed to file the return. See sections 6652, 6693, and 6721 for 
penalties for failure to file certain returns.
    (g) Effective date. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section, this section applies to returns filed after 
December 31, 1986.
    (2) Returns required on Form 1099-DIV, 1099-PATR, 1099-INT, or 1099-
OID for payments made after December 31, 1983, must be filed on magnetic 
media except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6011-2T  Required use of magnetic media (temporary).

    This section applies to information returns required to be filed 
after December 31, 1996. For information returns required to be filed 
after December 31, 1989, and before January 1, 1997, see section 6011(e) 
of the Internal Revenue Code and Sec. 301.6011-2.
    (a) Meaning of terms. The following definitions apply for purposes 
of this section:
    (1) Magnetic media. The term magnetic media means any magnetic media 
permitted under applicable regulations, revenue procedures, or, in the 
case of returns filed with the Social Security Administration, Social 
Security Administration publications. These generally include magnetic 
tape, tape cartridge, and diskette, as well as other media (such as 
electronic filing) specifically permitted under the applicable 
regulations, procedures, or publications.
    (2)-(3) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 301.6011-2(a) (2) 
and (3).
    (b) Returns required on magnetic media. (1) If the use of Form 1042-
S, 1098, 1099 series, 5498, 8027, W-2G, or other form treated as a form 
specified in this paragraph (b)(1) is required by the applicable 
regulations or revenue procedures for the purpose of making an 
information return, the information required by the form must be 
submitted on magnetic media, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section. Returns on magnetic media must be made in 
accordance with applicable revenue procedures or publications. See 
Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter. Pursuant to these procedures, 
the consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (or other authorized 
officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service) to a magnetic 
medium must be obtained by submitting Form 4419 (Application for Filing 
Information Returns Magnetically/Electronically) prior to submitting a 
return described in this paragraph (b)(1) on the magnetic medium.
    (2) If the use of Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement), Form 499R-2/W-
2PR (Withholding Statement), Form W-2VI (U.S. Virgin Islands Wage and 
Tax Statement), Form W-2GU (Guam Wage and Tax Statement), Form W-2AS

[[Page 20]]

(American Samoa Wage and Tax Statement), or other form treated as a form 
specified in this paragraph (b)(2) is required for the purpose of making 
an information return, the information required by the form must be 
submitted on magnetic media, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section. Returns described in this paragraph (b)(2) must be 
made in accordance with applicable Social Security Administration 
procedures or publications (which may be obtained from the local office 
of the Social Security Administration).
    (3) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 301.6011-2(b)(3).
    (c) Exceptions--(1) Low-volume filers/250-threshold--(i) In general. 
No person is required to file information returns on magnetic media 
unless the person is required to file 250 or more returns during the 
calendar year. Persons filing fewer than 250 returns during the calendar 
year may make the returns on the prescribed paper form, or, 
alternatively, such persons may make returns on magnetic media in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 301.6011-2(c)(1)(ii).
    (iii) No aggregation. Each type of information return described in 
paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section is considered a separate 
return for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1). Therefore, the 250-
threshold applies separately to each type of form required to be filed.
    (iv) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section are illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. For the calendar year ending December 31, 1996, Company X 
is required to file 200 returns on Form 1099-INT and 350 returns on Form 
1099-MISC. Company X is not required to file Forms 1099-INT on magnetic 
media but is required to file Forms 1099-MISC on magnetic media.
    Example 2. During the calendar year ending December 31, 1996, 
Company Y has 275 employees in Puerto Rico and 50 employees in American 
Samoa. Company Y is required to file Forms 499R-2/W-2PR on magnetic 
media but is not required to file Forms W-2AS on magnetic media.
    Example 3. For the calendar year ending December 31, 1996, Company Z 
files 300 original returns on Form 1099-DIV and later files 70 corrected 
returns on Form 1099-DIV. Company Z is required to file the original 
returns on magnetic media. However, Company Z is not required to file 
the corrected returns on magnetic media because the corrected returns 
fall under the 250-threshold. See Sec. 301.6721-1(a)(2)(ii).

    (2) Waiver. (i) The Commissioner may waive the requirements of this 
section if hardship is shown in a request for waiver filed in accordance 
with this paragraph (c)(2)(i). The principal factor in determining 
hardship will be the amount, if any, by which the cost of filing the 
information returns in accordance with this section exceeds the cost of 
filing the returns on other media. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an 
employer is required to make a final return on Form 941, or a variation 
thereof, and expedited filing of Forms W-2, Forms 499R-2/W-2PR, Forms W-
2VI, Forms W-2GU, or Form W-2AS is required, the unavailability of the 
specifications for magnetic media filing will be treated as creating a 
hardship. See Sec. 31.6071(a)-1(a)(3)(ii). A request for waiver must be 
made in accordance with applicable revenue procedures or publications. 
See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter. Pursuant to these 
procedures, a request for waiver should be filed at least 45 days before 
the due date of the information return in order for the Service to have 
adequate time to respond to the request for waiver. The waiver will 
specify the type of information return and the period to which it 
applies and will be subject to such terms and conditions regarding the 
method of reporting as may be prescribed by the Commissioner.
    (ii) The Commissioner may prescribe rules that supplement the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3)-(4) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 301.6011-2(c) (3) 
and (4).
    (d)-(e) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 301.6011-2 (d) and 
(e).
    (f) Failure to file. If a person fails to file an information return 
on magnetic media when required to do so by this section, the person is 
deemed to have failed to file the return. In addition, if a person 
making returns on a paper form under paragraph (c) of this section fails 
to file a return on machine-readable paper form when required to do so 
by this section, the person is

[[Page 21]]

deemed to have failed to file the return. See sections 6652, 6693, and 
6721 for penalties for failure to file certain returns. See also section 
6724 and the regulations under section 6721 for the specific rules and 
limitations regarding the penalty imposed under section 6721 for failure 
to file on magnetic media.
    (g) Effective date. (1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see 
Sec. 301.6011-2(g)(1).
    (2) Paragraphs (a)(1), (b) (1) and (2), (c)(1) (i), (iii), and (iv), 
(c)(2), and (f) of this section are effective for information returns 
required to be filed after December 31, 1996. For information returns 
required to be filed after December 31, 1989, and before January 1, 
1997, see section 6011(e) of the Internal Revenue Code and 
Sec. 301.6011-2.

Sec. 301.6057-1  Employee retirement benefit plans; identification of participant with deferred vested retirement benefit.

    (a) Annual registration statement--(1) In general. Under section 
6057(a), the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g)) 
of an employee retirement benefit plan must file with the Internal 
Revenue Service information relating to each plan participant

[[Page 26]]

who separates from service covered by the plan and is entitled to a 
deferred vested retirement benefit under the plan, but is not paid this 
retirement benefit. Plans subject to this filing requirement are 
described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Subparagraph (4) 
describes how the information is to be filed with the Internal Revenue 
Service. In the case of a plan to which only one employer contributes, 
the time for filing the information with respect to each separated 
participant is described in subparagraph (5). In the case of a plan to 
which more than one employer contributes the time for filing the 
information with respect to a participant is described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section also provides 
other rules applicable only to plans to which more than one employer 
contributes.
    (2) Deferred vested retirement benefit. For purposes of this 
section, a plan participant's deferred retirement benefit is considered 
a vested benefit if it is vested under the terms of the plan at the 
close of the plan year described in paragraph (a)(5) or (b)(4) of this 
section (whichever is applicable) for which information relating to any 
deferred vested retirement benefit of the participant must be filed. A 
participant's deferred retirement benefit need not be a nonforfeitable 
benefit within the meaning of section 411(a) for the filing requirements 
described in this section to apply. Accordingly, information relating to 
a participant's deferred vested retirement benefit must be filed as 
required by this section notwithstanding that the benefit is subject to 
forfeiture by reason of an event or condition occurring subsequent to 
the close of the plan year described in paragraph (a)(5) or (b)(4) of 
this section (whichever is applicable) for which information relating to 
any deferred vested retirement benefit of the participant must be filed.
    (3) Plans subject to filing requirement. The term ``employee 
retirement benefit plan'' means a plan to which the vesting standards of 
section 203 of part 2 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 854) apply for any day 
in the plan year. (For purposes of this section, ``plan year'' means the 
plan year as determined for purposes of the annual return required by 
section 6058(a)). Accordingly, a plan need not be a qualified plan 
within the meaning of section 401(a) to be subject to these filing 
requirements. A plan to which more than one employer contributes must 
file the report of deferred vested retirement benefits described in this 
section, but see paragraph (b) of this section for special rules 
applicable to such a plan. The filing requirements described in this 
section and Sec. 301.6057-2 (relating to notification of change in plan 
status) do not apply to a governmental or church plan described in 
section 414 (d) or (e).
    (4) Filing requirements. Information relating to the deferred vested 
retirement benefit of a plan participant must be filed on schedule SSA 
as an attachment to the Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan 
(form 5500 series). Schedule SSA shall be filed on behalf of an employee 
retirement benefit plan for each plan year for which information 
relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan participant 
is filed under paragraph (a)(5) or (b)(2) of this section. There shall 
be filed on schedule SSA the name and social security number of the 
participant, a description of the nature, form, and amount of the 
deferred vested retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled, 
and such other information as is required by section 6057(a) or schedule 
SSA and the accompanying instructions. The form of the benefit reported 
on schedule SSA shall be the normal form of benefit under the plan, or, 
if the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g)) 
considers it more appropriate, any other form of benefit.
    (5) Time for reporting deferred vested retirement benefit--(i) In 
general. In the case of a plan to which only one employer contributes, 
information relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan 
participant must be filed no later than on the schedule SSA filed for 
the plan year following the plan year within which the participant 
separates from service covered by the plan. Information relating to a 
separated participant may, at the option of the plan administrator, be 
reported earlier (that is, on the schedule SSA

[[Page 27]]

filed for the plan year in which the participant separates from service 
covered by the plan). For purposes of this paragraph a participant is 
not considered to separate from service covered by the plan solely 
because the participant incurs a break in service under the plan. In 
addition, for purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a plan which 
uses the elapsed time method described in Department of Labor 
regulations for crediting service for benefit accrual purposes, a 
participant is considered to separate from service covered by the plan 
on the date the participant severs from service covered by the plan.
    (ii) Exception. Notwithstanding subdivision (i), no information 
relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a separated 
participant is required to be filed on schedule SSA if, before the date 
such schedule SSA is required to be filed (including any extension of 
time for filing granted pursuant to section 6081), the participant (A) 
is paid some or all of the deferred vested retirement benefit under the 
plan, (B) returns to service covered by the plan, or (C) forfeits all of 
the deferred vested retirement benefit under the plan.
    (b) Plans to which more than one employer contributes--(1) 
Application. Section 6057 and this section apply to a plan to which more 
than one employer contributes with the modifications set forth in this 
paragraph. For purposes of section 6057 and this section, whether or not 
more than one employer contributes to a plan shall be determined by the 
number of employers who are required to contribute to the plan. Thus, 
for example, this paragraph applies to plans maintained by more than one 
employer which are collectively bargained as described in section 
413(a), multiple-employer plans described in section 413(c) and the 
regulations thereunder, multiemployer plans described in section 414(f), 
and plans adopted by more than one employer of certain controlled and 
common control groups described in section 414 (b) and (c).
    (2) Time for reporting deferred vested retirement benefit--(i) In 
general. In the case of a plan to which more than one employer 
contributes, information relating to the deferred vested retirement 
benefit of a plan participant must be filed no later than on the 
schedule SSA filed for the plan year within which the participant 
completes the second of two consecutive one-year breaks in service (as 
defined in the plan for vesting percentage purposes) in service 
computation periods (as defined in the plan for vesting percentage 
purposes) which begin after December 31, 1974. At the option of the plan 
administrator, information relating to a participant's deferred vested 
retirement benefit may be filed earlier (that is, on the schedule SSA 
filed for the plan year in which the participant incurs the first one-
year break in service or, in the case of a separated participant, on the 
schedule SSA filed for the plan year in which the participant separates 
from service).
    (ii) Special rules--For purposes of this subparagraph (1)--
    (A) For the definition of the term ``1-year break in service'' in 
the case of a plan which uses the elapsed time method described in 
Department of Labor Regulations for crediting service for vesting 
percentage purposes, see Sec. 1.411(a)-6(c)(2).
    (B) In the case of a plan which does not define the term ``1-year 
break in service'' for vesting percentage purposes, a plan participant 
shall be deemed to incur a 1-year break in service under the plan in any 
plan year within which the participant does not complete more than 500 
hours of service covered by the plan.
    (iii) Transitional rule. Notwithstanding subdivision (i), if the 
second consecutive 1-year break in service described in subdivision (i) 
is incurred in a plan year beginning before January 1, 1978, information 
relating to the participant's deferred vested retirement benefit is not 
required to be filed earlier than on the schedule SSA filed for the 
first plan year beginning after December 31, 1977.
    (iv) Exception. Notwithstanding subdivision (i) or (iii) of this 
subparagraph, no information relating to a participant's deferred vested 
retirement benefit is required to be filed on schedule SSA if, before 
the date such schedule SSA is required to be filed (including any 
extension of time for filing granted pursuant to section 6081), the 
participant (A) is paid some or all of

[[Page 28]]

the deferred vested retirement benefit under the plan, (B) accrues 
additional retirement benefits under the plan, or (C) forfeits all of 
the deferred vested retirement benefit under the plan.
    (3) Information relating to deferred vested retirement benefit--(i) 
Incomplete records. Section 6057(a) and paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
require the filing on schedule SSA of a description of the deferred 
vested retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled. If the 
plan administrator of a plan to which more than one employer contributes 
maintains records of a participant's service covered by the plan which 
are incomplete as of the close of the plan year with respect to which 
the plan administrator files information relating to the participant on 
schedule SSA, the plan administrator may elect to file the information 
required by schedule SSA based only upon these incomplete records. The 
plan administrator is not required, for purposes of completing schedule 
SSA, to compile from sources other than such records a complete record 
of a participant's years of service covered by the plan. Similarly, if 
retirement benefits under the plan are determined by taking into account 
a participant's service with an employer which is not service covered by 
the plan, but the plan administrator maintains records only with respect 
to periods of service covered by the plan, the plan administrator may 
complete schedule SSA taking into account only the participant's period 
of service covered by the plan.
    (ii) Inability to determine correct amount of participant's deferred 
vested retirement benefit. If the amount of a participant's deferred 
vested retirement benefit which is filed on schedule SSA is computed on 
the basis of plan records maintained by the plan administrator which--
    (A) Are incomplete with respect to the participant's service covered 
by the plan (as described in subdivision (i)), or
    (B) Fail to account for the participant's service not covered by the 
plan which is relevant to a determination of the participant's deferred 
vested retirement benefit under the plan (as described in subdivision 
(i)),

then the plan administrator must indicate on schedule SSA that the 
amount of the deferred vested retirement benefit shown therein may be 
other than that to which the participant is actually entitled because 
the amount is based upon incomplete records.
    (iii) Inability to determine whether participant vested in deferred 
retirement benefit. Where, as described in subdivision (i), information 
to be reported on schedule SSA is to be based upon records which are 
incomplete with respect to a participant's service covered by the plan 
or which fail to take into account relevant service not covered by the 
plan, the plan administrator may be unable to determine whether or not 
the participant is vested in any deferred retirement benefit. If, in 
view of information provided either by the incomplete records or the 
plan participant, there is a significant likelihood that the plan 
participant is vested in a deferred retirement benefit under the plan, 
information relating to the participant must be filed on schedule SSA 
with the notation that the participant may be entitled to a deferred 
vested retirement benefit under the plan, but information relating to 
the amount of the benefit may be omitted. This subdivision (iii) does 
not apply in a case in which it can be determined from plan records 
maintained by the plan administrator that the participant is vested in a 
deferred retirement benefit. Subdivision (ii), however, may apply in 
such a case.
    (c) Voluntary filing--(1) In general. The plan administrator of an 
employee retirement benefit plan described in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, or any other employee retirement benefit plan (including a 
governmental or church plan), may at its option, file on schedule SSA 
information relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of any 
plan participant who separates at any time from service covered by the 
plan, including plan participants who separate from service in plan 
years beginning before 1976.
    (2) Deleting previously filed information. If, after information 
relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan participant 
is filed on schedule SSA, the plan participant--
    (i) Is paid some or all of the deferred vested retirement benefit 
under the plan, or

[[Page 29]]

    (ii) Forfeits all of the deferred vested retirement benefit under 
the plan, the plan administrator may, at its option, file on schedule 
SSA (or such other form as may be provided for this purpose) the name 
and social security number of the participant with the notation that 
information previously filed relating to the participant's deferred 
vested retirement benefit should be deleted.
    (d) Filing incident to cessation of payment of benefits--(1) In 
general. As described in this section, no information relating to the 
deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan participant is required to 
be filed on schedule SSA if before the date such schedule SSA is 
required to be filed, some of the deferred vested retirement benefit is 
paid to the participant, and information relating to a participant's 
deferred vested retirement benefit which was previously filed on 
schedule SSA may be deleted if the participant is paid some of the 
deferred vested retirement benefit. If payment of the deferred vested 
retirement benefit ceases before all of the benefit to which the 
participant is entitled is paid to the participant, information relating 
to the deferred vested retirement benefit to which the participant 
remains entitled shall be filed on the schedule SSA filed for the plan 
year following the last plan year within which a portion of the benefit 
is paid to the participant.
    (2) Exception. Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, 
no information relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit to 
which the participant remains entitled is required to be filed on 
schedule SSA if, before the date such schedule SSA is required to be 
filed (including any extension of time for filing granted pursuant to 
section 6081), the participant (i) returns to service covered by the 
plan, (ii) accrues additional retirement benefits under the plan, or 
(iii) forfeits the benefit under the plan.
    (e) Individual statement to participant. The plan administrator of 
an employee retirement benefit plan defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section must provide each participant with respect to whom information 
is required to be filed on schedule SSA a statement describing the 
deferred vested retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled. 
The description provided the participant must include the information 
filed with respect to the participant on schedule SSA. The statement is 
to be delivered to the participant or forwarded to the participant's 
last known address no later than the date on which any schedule SSA 
reporting information with respect to the participant is required to be 
filed (including any extension of time for filing granted pursuant to 
section 6081).
    (f) Penalties. For amounts imposed in the case of failure to file 
the report of deferred vested retirement benefits required by section 
6057(a) and paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, see section 
6652(e)(1). For the penalty relating to a failure to provide the 
participant the individual statement of deferred vested retirement 
benefit required by section 6057(e) and paragraph (e) of this section, 
see section 6690.
    (g) Effective dates--(1) Plans to which only one employer 
contributes. In the case of a plan to which only one employer 
contributes, this section is effective for plan years beginning after 
December 31, 1975, and with respect to a participant who separates from 
service covered by the plan in plan years beginning after that date.
    (2) Plans to which more than one employer contributes. In the case 
of a plan to which more than one employer contributes, this section is 
effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1977, and with 
respect to a participant who completes two consecutive 1-year breaks in 
service under the plan in service computation periods beginning after 
December 31, 1974.

    (a) Change in plan status. The plan administrator (within the 
meaning of section 414(g)) of an employee retirement benefit plan 
defined in Sec. 301.6057-1(a)(3) (including a plan to which more than 
one employer contributes, as described in Sec. 301.6057-1(b)(1)) must

<R05>
Sec. 301.6058-1  Information required in connection with certain plans of deferred compensation.

    (a) Reporting of information--(1) Annual return. For each funded 
plan of deferred compensation an annual return must be filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service. The annual return of the plan is the 
appropriate Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan (Form 5500 
series) as determined under these forms. The annual period for the 
annual return of the plan shall be either the plan year or the taxable 
year of the employer maintaining the plan as determined under these 
forms. These forms are hereinafter referred to as the ``forms prescribed 
by section 6058(a).''
    (2) Plans subject to requirements. For purposes of this section, the 
term ``funded plan of deferred compensation'' means each pension, 
annuity, stock bonus, profit-sharing, or other funded plan of deferred 
compensation described in Part 1 of Subchapter D of Chapter 1. 
Accordingly, the term includes qualified plans under sections 401(a), 
403(a), and 405(a); individual retirement accounts and annuities 
described in sections 408(a) and 408(b); and custodial accounts under 
section 403(b)(7). The term also includes: funded plans of deferred 
compensation which are not qualified plans; funded governmental plans 
and church plans, whether or not qualified (See sections 414(d) and 
414(e)); and plans maintained outside the United States primarily for 
nonresident aliens (as described in subsection (b)(4) of section 4 of 
Subtitle A of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974; (88 Stat. 840)). The term does not include annuity contracts 
described in section 403(b)(1) or individual retirement accounts (an 
individual participant or surviving beneficiary in such account must 
file under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and bonds described in 
sections 408(c) and 409.
    (3) Required information. The information required to be furnished 
on the forms prescribed by section 6058(a) shall include such 
information concerning the qualification of the plan, the financial 
condition of the trust, fund, or custodial or fiduciary account which is 
a part of the plan, and the operation of the plan as shall be required 
by the forms, applicable accompanying schedules and related instructions 
applicable to the annual period.
    (4) Time of filing. The forms prescribed by section 6058(a) shall be 
filed in the manner and at the time as required by the forms and related 
instructions applicable to the annual period.
    (b) Who must file--(1) In general. The annual return required to be 
filed under section 6058(a) and paragraph (a) of this section for the 
annual period shall be filed by either the employer maintaining the plan 
or the plan administrator (as defined in section 414(g)) of the plan for 
that annual period. Whether the employer or plan administrator files 
shall be determined under the forms prescribed by section 6058(a) and 
related instructions applicable to the annual period. Nothing in these 
forms shall preclude an employer from filing the return on behalf of the 
plan administrator, or the plan administrator from filing on behalf of 
the employer.
    (2) Definition of employer. For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, the term ``employer'' includes a sole proprietor and a 
partnership.

[[Page 31]]

    (c) Other rules applicable to annual returns--(1) Extensions of time 
for filing. For rules relating to the extension of time for filing, see 
section 6081 and the regulations thereunder and the instructions on the 
forms prescribed by section 6058(a).
    (2) Amended filing. Any form prescribed by this section may be filed 
as an amendment to a form previously filed under this section with 
respect to the same annual period pursuant to the instructions for such 
forms.
    (3) Additional information. In addition to the information otherwise 
required to be furnished by this section, the district director may 
require any further information that is considered necessary to 
determine allowable deductions under section 404, qualification under 
section 401, or the financial condition and operation of the plan.
    (4) Records. Records substantiating all data and information 
required by this section to be filed must be kept at all times available 
for inspection by internal revenue officers at the principal office or 
place of business of the employer or plan administrator.
    (5) Relief from filing. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Commissioner may, in his discretion, relieve an employer, 
or plan administrator, from reporting information on the forms 
prescribed by section 6058(a). This discretion includes the ability to 
relieve an employer, or plan administrator, from filing the applicable 
form.
    (d) Special rules for individual retirement arrangements--(1) 
Application. This paragraph, in lieu of paragraph (a) of this section, 
applies to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) 
and an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b), 
including such accounts and annuities for which a deduction is allowable 
under section 220 (spousal individual retirement arrangements).
    (2) General rule. For each taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1974, every individual who during such taxable year--
    (i) Establishes or maintains an individual retirement account 
described in section 408(a) (including an individual who is a 
participant in an individual retirement account described in section 
408(c)).
    (ii) Purchases or maintains an individual retirement annuity 
described in section 408(b), or
    (iii) Is a surviving beneficiary with respect to an account or 
annuity referred to in this subparagraph which is in existence during 
such taxable year, shall file Form 5329 (or any other form designated by 
the Commissioner for this purpose), as an attachment to or part of the 
Form 1040 filed by such individual for such taxable year, setting forth 
in full the information required by that form and the accompanying 
instructions.
    (3) Special information returns. If an individual described in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is not required to file a Form 1040 
for such taxable year, such individual shall file a Form 5329 (or any 
other designated form) with the Internal Revenue Service by the 15th day 
of the 4th month following the close of such individual's taxable year 
setting forth in full the information required by that form and the 
accompanying instructions.
    (4) Relief from filing. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, 
relieve an individual from filing the form prescribed by this paragraph.
    (5) Retirement bonds. An individual who purchases, holds, or 
maintains a retirement bond described in section 409 may be required to 
file a return under other provisions of the Code.
    (e) Actuarial statement in case of mergers, etc. For requirements 
with respect to the filing of actuarial statements in the case of a 
merger, consolidation, or transfer of assets or liabilities, see section 
6058(b) and section 414(l) and the regulations thereunder.
    (f) Effective dates--(1) Section 6058 (a) requirements. The rules 
with respect to annual returns required under section 6058(a) (the rules 
in this section, other than paragraph (e) thereof) are effective for 
plan years beginning after September 2, 1974.
    (2) Section 6058(b) requirements. The requirements of section 
6058(b) relating to mergers, etc., and paragraph (e) of this section are 
effective on September 2, 1974, with respect to events described in 
section 6058(b) occurring on or after such date.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6059-1  Periodic report of actuary.

    (a) In general. The actuarial report described in this section must 
be filed on behalf on a defined benefit plan to which the minimum 
funding standards of section 412 apply. The actuarial report must be 
filed by the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g)) 
on Schedule B as an attachment to the annual Return/Report of Employee 
Benefit Plan (Form 5500 series). The instructions accompanying the Form 
5500 series prescribe the place and date for filing Schedule B.
    (b) Plan years for which report required. In the case of a plan in 
existence on January 1, 1974, Schedule B must be filed for the first 
plan year beginning after December 31, 1975, for which the minimum 
funding standards apply to the plan, and for each plan year thereafter 
for which the Schedule must be filed under the instructions accompanying 
the Schedule and the Form 5500 series. In the case of a plan not in 
existence on January 1, 1974, Schedule B must be filed for the first 
plan year beginning after September 2, 1974, for which the minimum 
funding standards apply to the plan, and for each plan year thereafter 
for which the Schedule must be filed under the instructions accompanying 
the Schedule and the Form 5500 series. For rules relating to when a plan 
is considered to be in existence, see Sec. 1.410(a)-2(c). For purposes 
of this section, ``plan year'' means the plan year as determined for 
purposes of the minimum funding standards.
    (c) Contents of report. The actuarial report of a plan filed on 
Schedule B must contain--
    (1) The date of the actuarial valuation applicable to the plan year 
for which the report is filed (see section 412(c)(9) for rules relating 
to the frequency with which an actuarial valuation of the plan is 
required to be made),
    (2) A description of the funding method and actuarial assumptions 
used to determine costs under the plan,
    (3) A certification of the contribution necessary to reduce the 
accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section 412(a)) to zero,
    (4) A statement by the enrolled actuary signing the report that to 
the best of the actuary's knowledge the report is complete and accurate,
    (5) A statement by the enrolled actuary signing the report that in 
the actuary's opinion the actuarial assumptions used are in the 
aggregate (i) reasonably related to the experience of the plan and to 
reasonable expectations, and (ii) represent the actuary's best estimate 
of anticipated experience under the plan,
    (6) Such other information as may be necessary to fully and fairly 
disclose the actuarial position of the plan, and
    (7) Such other information as may be required by Schedule B or the 
instructions accompanying the Schedule and the Form 5500 series.
    (d) Certification by enrolled actuary. The actuarial report filed on 
Schedule B must be signed by an enrolled actuary (within the meaning of 
section 7701(a)(35)) or there may be attached to the report a statement 
signed by the actuary that contains the statements described in 
paragraph (c) (4) and (5) of this section.

An actuarial report filed for a plan year ending after January 25, 1982, 
does not satisfy the requirements of this section if the actuary seeks 
to materially qualify such statements. For this purpose, the following 
are not considered to materially qualify a statement required by 
paragraph (c) (4) or (5) of this section:
    (1) A statement that the report is based in part on information 
provided to the actuary by another person, that such information would 
customarily not be verified by the actuary, and that the actuary has no 
reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of the information (taking into 
account the facts and circumstances that are known or reasonably should 
be known to the actuary, including the contents of any other actuarial 
report prepared by the actuary for the plan),
    (2) A statement that the report is based in part on information 
provided by another person, that the actuary believes such information 
is or may be inaccurate or incomplete, but that the inaccuracies or 
omissions are not material, the inaccuracies or omissions are not so 
numerous or flagrant as to

[[Page 33]]

suggest that there may be material inaccuracies, and that therefore the 
actuarial report is substantially accurate and complete and fairly 
discloses the actuarial position of the plan,
    (3) A statement that the report reflects the requirement of a 
regulation or ruling, and that any statement regarding the actuarial 
position of the plan is made only in light of such requirement,
    (4) A statement that the report reflects an interpretation of a 
statute, regulation or ruling, that the actuary has no reason to doubt 
the validity of that interpretation, and that any statement regarding 
the actuarial position of the plan is made only in light of such 
interpretation,
    (5) A statement that in the opinion of the actuary the report fully 
reflects the requirements of an applicable statute, but does not conform 
to the requirements of a regulation or ruling promulgated under the 
statute that the actuary believes is contrary to the statute, or
    (6) A statement furnished to comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section.

A statement otherwise described in a subparagraph of this paragraph (d) 
shall not be considered to satisfy the requirements of such subparagraph 
unless the statement identifies, with particularity, that matter to 
which the statement relates and the facts and circumstances surrounding 
the statement. In addition, a statement otherwise described in 
subparagraph (5) of this paragraph (d) shall not be considered to 
satisfy the requirements of that subparagraph unless the statement 
indicates whether an accumulated funding deficiency or a contribution 
that is not wholly deductible may result if the actuary's belief is 
determined to be incorrect.
    (e) Relief from filing. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's discretion, relieve 
a plan administrator from filing Schedule B or from reporting 
information required by Schedule B or paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Penalty. For the penalty imposed in the case of a failure to 
file the actuarial report required by this section, see section 6692 and 
Sec. 301.6692-1.

1972 for which no designation was made under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, a designation may be made on the form furnished by the Internal 
Revenue Service for such purpose, filed within 20 and one half months 
after the due date for the original return for such taxable year. In the 
case of a joint return where neither spouse made a designation or where

previously made a designation.
    (3) A designation once made, whether by an original return or 
otherwise, may not be revoked.
    (d) Effective date. This section shall apply to taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1972.

paragraph (b) of this section, is one dollar or more, may, at his 
option, designate that one dollar shall be paid over to the Presidential

accordance with prior law, such a designation was made for the account

Vice President of the United States, such a designation shall be treated 
solely as a designation to such fund.
    (2) In the case of a joint return of a husband and wife, each spouse

[[Page 36]]

fund as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if the joint

<R05>
Sec. 301.6101-1   Period covered by returns or other documents.

    For provisions concerning the period covered by returns or other 
documents, see the regulations relating to the particular tax.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6102-1   Computations on returns or other documents.

    (a) Amounts shown on forms. To the extent permitted by any internal 
revenue form or instructions prescribed for use with respect to any 
internal revenue return, declaration, statement, other document, or 
supporting schedules, any amount required to be reported on such form 
shall be entered at the nearest whole dollar amount. The extent to 
which, and the conditions under which, such whole dollar amounts shall 
be entered on any form will be set forth in the instructions issued with 
respect to such form. For the purpose of the computation to the nearest 
dollar, a fractional part of a dollar shall be disregarded unless it 
amounts to one-half dollar or more, in which case the amount (determined 
without regard to the fractional part of a dollar) shall be increased by 
$1. The following illustrates the application of this paragraph:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 To be  
                        Exact amount                           reported 
                                                                 as--   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$18.49......................................................         $18
$18.50......................................................          19
$18.51......................................................          19
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Election not to use whole dollar amounts--(1) Method of 
election. Where any internal revenue form, or the instructions issued 
with respect to such form, provide that whole dollar amounts shall be 
reported, any person making a return, declaration, statement, or other 
document on such form may elect not to use whole dollar amounts by 
reporting thereon all amounts in full, including cents.
    (2) Time of election. The election not to use whole dollar amounts 
must be made at the time of filing the return, declaration, statement, 
or other document. Such election may not be revoked after the time 
prescribed for filing such return, declaration, statement, or other 
document, including extensions of time granted for such filing. Such 
election may be made on any return, declaration, statement, or other 
document which is filed after the time prescribed for filing (including 
extensions of time), and such an election is irrevocable.

[[Page 37]]

    (3) Effect of election. The taxpayer's election shall be binding 
only on the return, declaration, statement, or other document filed for 
a taxable year or period, and a new election may be made on the return, 
declaration, statement, or other document filed for a subsequent taxable 
year or period. An election by either a husband or a wife not to report 
whole dollar amounts on a separate income tax return shall be binding on 
any subsequent joint return filed under the provisions of section 
6013(b).
    (4) Fractional part of a cent. For treatment of the fractional part 
of a cent in the payment of taxes, see section 6313 and Sec. 301.6313-1.
     (c) Inapplicability to computation of amount. The provisions of 
paragraph (a) of this section apply only to amounts required to be 
reported on a return, declaration, statement, or other document. They do 
not apply to items which must be taken into account in making the 
computations necessary to determine such amounts. For example, each item 
of receipt must be taken into account at its exact amount, including 
cents, in computing the amount of total receipts required to be reported 
on an income tax return or supporting schedule. It is the amount of 
total receipts, so computed, which is to be reported at the nearest 
whole dollar on the return or supporting schedule.
    (d) Effect on accounting method. Section 6102 and this section have 
no effect on any authorized accounting method.

90 Stat. 1667) may be disclosed by, or on behalf of, such officer, 
employee, or agency after December 31, 1976, for any purpose authorized 
by such section (or such order or rules and regulations) before such 
amendment.
    (b) Exception. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a return or return information (including taxpayer return 
information) disclosed before January 1, 1977, by the Service to an 
officer or employee of a Federal agency for a purpose unrelated to tax 
administration as described in paragraph (a) may, after December 31,

          to such attorneys, officers, and employees by the Service 
          before January 1, 1977, for a purpose involving tax

return information (including taxpayer return information), as defined 
in section 6103(b) (1), (2), and (3), of the Internal Revenue Code

    (b) Exception. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of

employee in an administrative or judicial proceeding only if such 
proceeding is one described in section 6103(h)(4) of the Code and if the 
requirements of section 6103 (h)(4) have first been met.

Sec. 301.6103(c)-1  Disclosure of returns and return information (including taxpayer return information) to designee of taxpayer.

    (a) Disclosure of returns and return information (including taxpayer 
return information) to person or persons designated in a written request 
or consent. Section 6103 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code applies to 
disclosures of a return or return information (including taxpayer return 
information) to a person designated in a written request for or consent 
to disclosure. A request for or consent to disclosure must be in the 
form of a written document pertaining solely to the authorized 
disclosure. The written document must be signed and dated by the 
taxpayer who filed the return or to whom the return information relates. 
The taxpayer must also indicate in the written document--
    (1) The taxpayer's taxpayer identity information described in 
section 6103(b)(6);
    (2) The identity of the person to whom disclosure is to be made;
    (3) The type of return (or specified portion of the return) or 
return information (and the particular data) that is to be disclosed; 
and
    (4) The taxable year covered by the return or return information.

Thus, for example, a provision included in a taxpayer's application for 
a loan or other benefit authorizing the Internal Revenue Service to 
disclose to the grantor of the loan or other benefit such returns or 
return information as the grantor may request for purposes of verifying 
information supplied on the application does not meet the requirements 
of this paragraph. The disclosure of a return or return information 
authorized by a request for or consent to the disclosure shall not be 
made unless the request or consent is received by the Service within 60 
days following the date upon which the request or consent was signed and 
dated by the taxpayer.
    (b) Disclosure of returns and return information (including taxpayer 
return information) to designee of taxpayer to comply with request for 
information or assistance. Section 6103(c) of the Code applies to 
requests made by the taxpayer to other persons (for example, members of 
Congress, friends or relatives of the taxpayer, and, when not acting as 
a taxpayer's representative, income tax return preparers) for 
information or assistance relating to the taxpayer's return or a 
transaction or other contact between the taxpayer and the Service.

The taxpayer's request for information or assistance must be in the form 
of a letter or other written document signed and dated by the taxpayer. 
The taxpayer must also indicate in the written request--
    (1) The taxpayer's taxpayer identity information described in 
section 6103(b)(6);
    (2) The identity of the person to whom disclosure is to be made; and

[[Page 39]]

    (3) Sufficient facts underlying the request for information or 
assistance to enable the Service to determine the nature and extent of 
the information or assistance requested and the returns or return 
information to be disclosed in order to comply with the taxpayer's 
request.

A return or return information will be disclosed to the taxpayer's 
designee as provided by this paragraph only to the extent considered 
necessary by the Service to comply with the taxpayer's request for 
information or assistance. This paragraph does not apply to disclosures 
to a taxpayer's representative in connection with practice before the 
Service (as defined in Treasury Department Circular No. 230). For 
disclosures in these cases, see Sec. 601.502(c) of this chapter.
    (c) Exceptions. A disclosure of return information shall not be made 
under this section if the Service determines that the disclosure would 
seriously impair Federal tax administration (as defined in section 
6103(b)(4) of the Code).

(Secs. 6103 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (90 Stat.

supervisory personnel, such as Section Chiefs, Deputy Assistant 
Attorneys General, Assistant Attorneys General, the Deputy Attorney 
General, and the Attorney General), of the Department of Justice where 
necessary--

    (ii) In connection with any Federal grand jury proceeding, or 
preparation for any proceeding (or with an investigation which may

tax portion of such proceeding (or investigation) has been duly 
authorized by or on behalf of the Assistant Attorney General for the Tax 
Division of the Department of Justice, pursuant to the request of the 
Secretary, as a proceeding (or investigation) described in paragraph 
(a)(1). If, in the course of a Federal grand jury

Sec. 301.6103(n)-1  Disclosure of returns and return information in connection with procurement of property and services for tax administration purposes.

    (a) General rule. Pursuant to the provisions of section 6103(n) of 
the Internal Revenue Code and subject to the requirements of paragraphs 
(b), (c), and (d) of this section, officers or employees of the Treasury 
Department, a State tax agency, the Social Security Administration, or 
the Department of Justice, are authorized to disclose returns and return 
information (as defined in section 6103(b)) to any person (including, in 
the case of the Treasury Department, any person described in section 
7513(a)), or to an officer or employee of such person, to the extent 
necessary in connection with contractual procurement of--
    (1) Equipment or other property, or
    (2) Services relating to the processing, storage, transmission, or 
reproduction of such returns or return information, the programming, 
maintenance, repair, or testing of equipment or other property, or the 
providing of other services, for purposes of tax administration (as 
defined in section 6103(b)(4)).

No person, or officer or employee of such person, to whom a return or 
return information is disclosed by an officer or employee of the 
Treasury Department, the State tax agency, the Social Security 
Administration, or the Department of Justice, under the authority of 
this paragraph shall in turn disclose such return or return information 
for any purpose other than as described in this paragraph, and no such 
further disclosure for any such described purpose shall be made by such 
person, officer, or employee to anyone, other than another officer or 
employee of such person whose duties or responsibilities require such 
disclosure for a purpose described in this paragraph, without written 
approval by the Internal Revenue Service.
    (b) Limitations. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, 
disclosure of returns or return information in connection with 
contractual procurement of property or services described in such 
paragraph will be treated as necessary only if such procurement or the 
performance of such services cannot otherwise be reasonably, properly, 
or economically carried out or performed without such disclosure. Thus, 
for example, disclosures of returns or return information to employees 
of a contractor for purposes of programming, maintaining, repairing, or 
testing computer equipment used by the Internal Revenue Service or a 
State tax agency should be made only if such services cannot be 
reasonably, properly, or economically performed by use of information or 
other data in a form which does not identify a particular taxpayer. If, 
however, disclosure of returns or return information is in fact 
necessary in order for such employees to reasonably, properly, or 
economically perform the computer related services, such disclosures 
should be restricted to returns or return information selected or 
appearing at random. Further, for

[[Page 55]]

purposes of paragraph (a), disclosure of returns or return information 
in connection with the contractual procurement of property or services 
described in such paragraph should be made only to the extent necessary 
to reasonably, properly, or economically conduct such procurement 
activity. Thus, for example, if an activity described in paragraph (a) 
can be reasonably, properly, and economically conducted by disclosure of 
only parts or portions of a return or if deletion of taxpayer identity 
information (as defined in section 6103(b)(6) of the Code) reflected on 
a return would not seriously impair the ability of the contractor or his 
officers or employees to conduct the activity, then only such parts or 
portions of the return, or only the return with taxpayer identity 
information deleted, should be disclosed.
    (c) Notification requirements. Each officer or employee of any 
person to whom returns or return information is or may be disclosed as 
authorized by paragraph (a) of this section shall be notified in writing 
by such person that returns or return information disclosed to such 
officer or employee can be used only for a purpose and to the extent 
authorized by paragraph (a) of this section and that further disclosure 
of any such returns or return information for a purpose or to an extent 
unauthorized by such paragraph constitutes a felony, punishable upon 
conviction by a fine of as much as $5,000, or imprisonment for as long 
as 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. Such person 
shall also so notify each such officer and employee that any such 
unauthorized further disclosure of returns or return information may 
also result in an award of civil damages against the officer or employee 
in an amount not less than $1,000 with respect to each instance of 
unauthorized disclosure.
    (d) Safeguards. Any person to whom a return or return information is 
disclosed as authorized by paragraph (a) of this section shall comply 
with all applicable conditions and requirements which may be prescribed 
by the Internal Revenue Service for the purposes of protecting the 
confidentiality of returns and return information and preventing 
disclosures of returns or return information in a manner unauthorized by 
paragraph (a). The terms of any contract between the Treasury 
Department, a State tax agency, the Social Security Administration, or 
the Department of Justice, and a person pursuant to which a return or 
return information is or may be disclosed for a purpose described in 
paragraph (a) shall provide, or shall be amended to provide, that such 
person, and officers and employees of the person, shall comply with all 
such applicable conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed by the 
Service by regulation, published rules or procedures, or written 
communication to such person. If the Service determines that any person, 
or an officer or employee of any such person, to whom returns or return 
information has been disclosed as provided in paragraph (a) has failed 
to, or does not, satisfy such prescribed conditions or requirements, the 
Service may take such actions as are deemed necessary to ensure that 
such conditions or requirements are or will be satisfied, including--
    (1) Suspension or termination of any duty or obligation arising 
under a contract with the Treasury Department referred to in this 
paragraph or suspension of disclosures by the Treasury Department 
otherwise authorized by paragraph (a) of this section, or
    (2) Suspension of further disclosures of returns or return 
information by the Service to the State tax agency, or to the Department 
of Justice, until the Service determines that such conditions and 
requirements have been or will be satisfied.
    (e) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) The term Treasury Department includes the Internal Revenue 
Service and the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue 
Service;
    (2) The term State tax agency means an agency, body, or commission 
described in section 6103(d) of the Code; and
    (3) The term Department of Justice includes offices of the United 
States Attorneys.

Sec. 301.6103(p)(2)(B)-1  Disclosure of certain returns and return information by other Federal agencies.

    (a) General rule. Subject to the requirements of this section, 
returns and return information disclosed by the Internal Revenue Service 
to officers and employees of another Federal agency (as defined in 
section 6103(b)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code) as provided by section 
6103 may, if the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determines that such 
returns or return information is more readily available from such 
Federal agency, be disclosed by such officers and employees to officers 
and employees of another Federal agency, the General Accounting Office, 
an agency, body, or commission described in section 6103(d) or (l)(6), 
or to a person described in section 6103 (c) or (e) for a purpose or use 
authorized or required by, but subject to any requirements imposed by, 
any other provision of section 6103 and the regulations thereunder. Any 
such disclosure may be made only as, to the extent, and to such persons 
as may be authorized in writing by the Commissioner pursuant to a 
written request for such disclosure by such person, and containing such 
information, as may be designated or provided by the applicable 
provisions of section 6103 and the regulations thereunder pursuant to 
which the disclosure is sought. Such disclosure authorization by the 
Commissioner shall be directed to the head of the Federal agency from 
which disclosure is sought and may contain such conditions or 
restrictions as the Commissioner may prescribe.
    (b) Records and reports of disclosure. The Federal agency making a 
disclosure authorized by paragraph (a) of this section shall maintain to 
the satisfaction of the Service a permanent system of standardized 
records with respect to any disclosure authorization by the Commissioner 
described in paragraph (a) and any disclosure of returns or return 
information made pursuant to such authorization. In order to enable the 
Service to make a timely submission of the public report on disclosures 
to the Joint Committee on Taxation as required by section 6103(p)(3)(C) 
of the Code, the Federal agency shall, within 30 days after the close of 
each calendar year, furnish to the Commissioner a report with respect to 
such records which provides the number of--
    (1) Disclosure authorizations by the Commissioner,
    (2) Instances in which returns or return information was disclosed 
pursuant to such disclosure authorizations and to disclosure 
authorizations executed in prior calendar years, and
    (3) Taxpayers whose returns or return information with respect to 
whom was disclosed pursuant to the disclosure authorization described in 
subparagraph (2).

In addition, in order to enable the Service to make a timely submission 
of the report to the Joint Committee on Taxation required by section 
6103(p)(3)(B), the Federal agency shall furnish to the Commissioner a 
report with respect to, or summary of, the records at such time or 
times, in such form, and containing such information as the Commissioner 
may prescribe in a written request directed to the head of such Federal 
agency. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to disclosures 
of taxpayer identity information described in section 6103(m) or to 
disclosures of returns and return information as provided by paragraph 
(a) which, had such disclosures been made directly by the Service, would 
not have been subject to the recordkeeping requirements imposed by 
section 6103(p)(3)(A).

Sec. 301.6103(p)(7)-1  Procedures for administrative review of a determination that a State tax agency has failed to safeguard Federal tax returns or return information.

    (a) Notice of Service's intention to terminate disclosure to a State 
tax agency. Notwithstanding subsection (d) of section 6103, the Internal 
Revenue Service may terminate disclosure of Federal returns and return 
information to a State agency, body, or commission described in section 
6103(d) (hereinafter in this section referred to as a State tax agency) 
if the Service makes a determination that:

[[Page 57]]

    (1) A State tax agency has made unauthorized disclosure of Federal 
returns or return information received from the Service and that the 
State tax agency has not taken adequate corrective action to prevent 
repetition of the unauthorized disclosure, or
    (2) A State tax agency does not satisfactorily maintain the 
safeguards described in subsection (p)(4) of section 6103, and has made 
no adequate plan to improve its system to maintain those safeguards 
satisfactorily. Prior to terminating disclosure, the Service will notify 
the State tax agency in writing of the Service's preliminary 
determination and of the Service's intention to discontinue disclosure 
of Federal returns and return information to the State tax agency. Upon 
so notifying the State tax agency, the Service, if it determines that 
Federal tax administration would otherwise be seriously impaired, may 
suspend further disclosure of Federal returns and return information to 
the State tax agency pending a final determination by the Commissioner 
or Deputy Commissioner described in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (b) State tax agency's right to appeal. A State tax agency shall 
have 30 days from the date of receipt of a notice described in paragraph 
(a) of this section to appeal the preliminary determination described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The appeal shall be made directly to the 
Commissioner.
    (c) Procedures for administrative review. (1) To appeal a 
preliminary determination described in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the State agency shall send a written request for a conference to: 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Attention: C), 1111 Constitution 
Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20224. The request must include a complete 
description of the State tax agency's present system of safeguarding 
Federal returns or return information received from the Service. The 
request must then state the reason or reasons that the State agency 
believes that such system, including improvements, if any, to such 
system expected to be made in the near future, is or will be adequate to 
safeguard Federal returns or return information received from the 
Service.
    (2) Within 45 days of the receipt of a request made in accordance 
with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the 
Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner will personally hold a conference 
with representatives of the State tax agency, after which the 
Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner will make a final determination with 
respect to the appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6104(a)-1  Public inspection of material relating to tax-exempt organizations.

    (a) Application for tax exemption and supporting documents. If the 
Internal Revenue Service determines that an organization described in 
section 501 (c) or (d) is exempt from taxation for any taxable year, the 
application for tax exemption upon which the determination is based, 
together with any supporting documents, is open to public inspection. 
Some applications for tax exemption have been destroyed and therefore 
are not available for inspection. For purposes of determining the 
availability for public inspection, a claim for tax exemption filed to 
reestablish exempt status after denial thereof under the provisions of 
section 503 or 504 (as in effect on December 31, 1969), or under the 
corresponding provisions of any prior revenue law, is considered an 
application for tax exemption.
    (b) Letters or documents issued by the Internal Revenue Service with 
respect to an application for tax exemption. If an application for tax 
exemption is filed with the Internal Revenue Service after October 31, 
1976, and is open to public inspection under paragraph (a) of this 
section, then any letter or document issued to the applicant by the 
Internal Revenue Service which relates to the application is also open 
to public inspection. For rules relating to when a letter or document is 
issued, see Sec. 301.6110-2(h). Letters or documents to which this 
paragraph applies include, but are not limited to--
    (1) Favorable rulings and determination letters (see 
Sec. 601.201(n)(1)) issued in

[[Page 58]]

response to applications for tax exemption,
    (2) Technical advice memoranda (see Sec. 601.201(n)(9)) issued with 
respect to an approved, or subsequently approved, application for tax 
exemption, and
    (3) Letters issued in response to an application for tax exemption 
that propose a finding that the organization is not entitled to be 
exempt from tax, if the organization is subsequently determined, on the 
basis of the application, to be exempt from tax.
    (c) Requirement of exempt status. An application for tax exemption, 
supporting documents, and letters or documents issued by the Internal 
Revenue Service that relate to the application will not be open to 
public inspection before the organization filing the application is 
determined, on the basis of the application, to be exempt from taxation 
for any taxable year. On the other hand, if the organization is 
determined to be exempt for any taxable year, the material will not be 
withheld from public inspection on the ground that the organization is 
determined not to be exempt for any other taxable year.
    (d) Documents included in the term ``application for tax 
exemption''. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Prescribed application form. If a form is prescribed for an 
organization's application for tax exemption, the application for tax 
exemption includes the form and all documents and statements the 
Internal Revenue Service requires to be filed with the form.
    (2) No prescribed application form. If no form is prescribed for an 
organization's application for tax exemption, the application for tax 
exemption includes:
    (i) The application letter and a copy of the articles of 
incorporation, declaration of trust, or other instrument of similar 
import that sets forth the permitted powers or activities of the 
organization,
    (ii) The bylaws or other code of regulations,
    (iii) The latest financial statement showing assets, liabilities, 
receipts and disbursements,
    (iv) Statements showing the character of the organization, the 
purpose for which it was organized, and its actual activities,
    (v) Statements showing sources of income and receipts and the 
disposition thereof, and whether or not any income or receipts is 
credited to surplus or may inure to the benefit of any private 
shareholder or individual, and
    (vi) Any other statements or documents the Internal Revenue Service 
requires to be filed with the application lettter.
    (3) Prohibited transactions. An application for tax exemption does 
not include a request for a ruling as to whether a proposed transaction 
is a prohibited transaction under section 503.
    (e) Supporting documents defined. For purposes of this section, 
``supporting documents'', as used with respect to an application for tax 
exemption, means any statement or document not described in paragraph 
(d) of this section that is submitted by an organization in support of 
its application. For example, a legal brief submitted in support of an 
application for tax exemption is a supporting document.
    (f) Statement of exempt status. In addition to having the 
opportunity to inspect material relating to tax exempt organizations, a 
person may request a statement setting forth the following information:
    (1) The subsection and paragraph of section 501 (or the 
corresponding provision of any prior revenue law) under which an 
organization has been determined, on the basis of an application open to 
public inspection, to qualify for exemption from taxation, and
    (2) Whether the organization is currently held to be exempt.

The request for the statement must be made in the same manner as a 
request for inspection (see Sec. 301.6104(a)-6).
    (g) Withholding of certain information from public inspection. For 
rules relating to certain information contained in an application for 
tax exemption and related material which will be withheld from public 
inspection, see Sec. 301.6104(a)-5(a).
    (h) Procedures for inspection. For rules relating to procedures for 
public inspection of applications for tax exemption and related 
material, see Sec. 301.6104(a)-6.
    (i) Material not open to public inspection under section 6104 or 
6110. Under

[[Page 59]]

section 6110 certain written determinations issued by the Internal 
Revenue Service are made available for public inspection. Section 6110 
does not apply, however, to matters on which the determination of 
availability for public inspection is made under section 6104. 
Accordingly, Sec. 301.6110-1(a) describes matters which, for purposes of 
section 6110, are considered within the ambit of section 6104. Some 
determination letters and other documents relating to tax exempt 
organizations that are not open to public inspection under section 
6104(a)(1)(A) and this section are nevertheless within the ambit of 
section 6104 for purposes of section 6110. These determination letters 
and other documents are therefore not available for public inspection 
under either section 6104 or section 6110. They include but are not 
limited to--
    (1) Unfavorable rulings or determination letters (see 
Sec. 601.201(n)) issued in response to applications for tax exemption,
    (2) Rulings or determination letters revoking or modifying a 
favorable determination letter (see Sec. 601.201(n)(6)),
    (3) Technical advice memoranda (see Sec. 601.201(n)(9)) relating to 
a disapproved application for tax exemption or the revocation or 
modification of a favorable determination letter,
    (4) Any letter or document filed with or issued by the Internal 
Revenue Service relating to whether a proposed or accomplished 
transaction is a prohibited transaction under section 503,
    (5) Any letter or document filed with or issued by the Internal 
Revenue Service relating to an organization's status as an organization 
described in section 509 (a) or 4942(j)(3), unless the letter or 
document relates to the organization's application for tax exemption, 
and
    (6) Any other letter or document filed with or issued by the 
Internal Revenue Service which, although it relates to an organization's 
tax exempt status as an organization described in section 501 (c) or 
(d), does not relate to that organization's application for tax 
exemption, within the meaning of paragraph (d).

supporting documents filed by the applicant in support of the 
application, will be open to public inspection under section 
6104(a)(1)(B) (i) and (ii). An application for a determination letter 
and supporting documents will be open to public inspection whether or

letter''--(1) Employees' plans and individual retirement plans. For 
purposes of this section, the term ``application for a determination

for which an application form is prescribed, the application for a 
determination letter includes the form and all documents and statements

application for a determination letter for which no application form is 
prescribed, the application for a determination letter includes the 
application letter and all documents and statements the Internal Revenue 
Service requires to be submitted with the application letter.
    (c) Documents not constituting an ``application for a determination 
letter''. The following are not applications for a determination letter 
for purposes of this section:
    (1) An incomplete application that is returned without action for 
proper completion,
    (2) An application that is returned without action to the applicant 
for failure to notify all interested parties in accordance with the 
regulations under section 7476 (relating to declaratory judgments), and
    (3) A request for a ruling as to whether a proposed transaction is a 
prohibited transaction under section 4975.
    (d) Supporting documents. ``Supporting documents'', as used with 
respect to an application for a determination letter which is open to 
public inspection under this section, means any statement or document 
submitted in support of the application which is not specifically 
required by the application form or the Internal Revenue Service. For 
example, a legal brief submitted in support of an application for a 
determination letter is a supporting document.
    (e) Applicant. For purposes of this section, Sec. 301.6104(a)-3 
(relating to Internal Revenue Service letters and documents open to

    (a) In general. Except as provided in Sec. 301.6104(a)-4 with 
respect to plans having fewer than 26 participants, a letter or other 
document issued by the Internal Revenue Service after September 2, 1974, 
is open to public inspection under section 6104(a)(1)(B)(iv) and this 
section, if it is issued with respect to--

or account.
    (b) Scope. Internal Revenue Service letters and documents open to

however, then the letter or document will be open to inspection if 
issued to the representative. For rules relating to when a letter or 
document is issued, see Sec. 301.6110-2(h). Internal Revenue Service

which no determination letter has been issued,
    (4) Letters or documents revoking or modifying any prior favorable 
determination letter or denying the qualification of a plan, account or 
annuity for which no determination letter has been issued,
    (5) Determination letters relating to the exemption from tax of a 
trust or custodial account described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
(see Sec. 601.201 (o)(2)(i)(b)), or
    (6) Opinion letters relating to the acceptability of the form of any 
master, prototype or other such plan or account (see Sec. 601.201 (p) 
and (q)) or notification letters issued with respect to pattern plans.
    (d) Extent letter or document open to public inspection. A letter or 
document issued by the Internal Revenue Service is open to public 
inspection under section 6104(a)(1)(B)(iv) and this section only to the 
extent it relates directly to the qualification of a plan, account or 
annuity, the exemption from tax of a related organization or custodial 
account, or the approval of a master, prototype, pattern or other such 
plan. Any part of the letter or document which does not directly relate 
to such a qualification, exemption or approval is not open to public 
inspection. For example, a letter to an employer which concludes that an 
employee's plan is not qualified and the related trust is not tax exempt 
will be open to public inspection. However, that same letter may also 
assert an income tax deficiency because employer contributions to the 
trust are, therefore, not deductible. In such a case, that part of the 
letter relating to the tax deficiency will be deleted before the letter 
is opened to public inspection.
    (e) Letters or documents issued with respect to tax return 
examination. In the case of an examination of a taxpayer's return or 
consideration of a taxpayer's claim for credit or refund, no letter or 
document issued to the taxpayer before the preliminary or ``30-day'' 
letter described in Sec. 601.105(d)(1) is issued to the taxpayer will be 
open to public inspection under section 6104(a)(1)(B)(iv) and this 
section. The ``30-day'' letter and any statutory notice of deficiency 
subsequently issued to the taxpayer under section 6212 will be open to 
public inspection to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section. If any letter or document other than a statutory notice of 
deficiency is issued to the taxpayer after the ``30-day'' letter is 
issued, such letter or document will be open to inspection to the extent 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section only if it finally resolves or 
otherwise disposes of a plan qualification or tax exemption issue raised 
in the ``30-day'' letter.
    (f) Letters or documents issued after September 2, 1974. Section 
6104(a)(1)(B)(iv) and this section apply to letters or documents issued 
by the Internal Revenue Service after September 2, 1974, even though the 
relevant application for a determination letter or other initiating 
correspondence from the applicant was filed with

[[Page 62]]

the Internal Revenue Service before September 2, 1974.

(Secs. 6104(a)(1)(A), 6104(a)(1)(B), and 7805 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954 (72 Stat. 1660, 88 Stat. 940, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C.

Sec. 301.6104(a)-4  Requirement for 26 or more plan participants.

    (a) Inspection by plan participants. In the case of a plan, annuity 
or account described in Sec. 301.6104(a)-2(b) and Sec. 301.6104(a)-3(a) 
that has fewer than 26 participants, material described in 
Secs. 301.6104(a)-2 and 301.6104(a)-3 as open to public inspection is 
only open to inspection by a plan participant or the participant's 
authorized representative. This limitation does not apply, however, with 
respect to documents which an applicant files with respect to a request 
for approval of a master, prototype, pattern or other such plan (see 
Sec. 301.6104 (a)-2 (b)(3)) or to opinion, notification or other such 
letters issued by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to such 
plans (see Sec. 301.6104 (a)-3 (a)(3)).
    (b) Determining number of plan participants--(1) In general. For 
purposes of determining whether a plan has fewer than 26 participants, 
the number of plan participants will be the number indicated on the most 
recent annual return filed for the plan under section 6058. Where an 
annual return indicates the number of participants both at the beginning 
and end of the plan year, the number indicated on the return means the 
number at the end of the plan year. If no annual return has been filed 
for the plan, then the number of plan participants will be the number 
indicated on the most recent application for a determination letter 
filed for the plan. If, however, the number of plan participants is 
increased prior to final Internal Revenue Service action on the 
application, the number of plan participants will be that increased 
number.
    (2) Decreasing number of plan participants. If a plan having 26 or 
more participants, as indicated on an annual return or application for a 
determination letter, subsequently files an annual return indicating 
fewer than 26 plan participants, then material relating to the plan 
which is issued or received by the Internal Revenue Service after the 
date the annual return is filed will be open to inspection only by plan 
participants or their authorized representatives. Similarly, if a plan 
having 26 or more participants as indicated on an annual return or an 
application for a determination letter, subsequently files an 
application for a determination letter which indicates fewer than 26 
plan participants, then that application and related material, as well 
as any other material relating to the plan which is received or issued 
by the Internal Revenue Service after the date of receipt of that 
application, will be open to inspection only by plan participants or 
their authorized representatives. In either case, material open to 
public inspection pursuant to the number of plan participants indicated 
on previous annual returns or applications for a determination letter 
will remain open to public inspection.
    (3) Increasing number of plan participants. If a plan having fewer 
than 26 plan participants, as indicated on an annual return or 
application for a determination letter, files a subsequent return or 
application indicating 26 or more plan participants, all the plan's 
prior applications and other material received or issued by the Internal 
Revenue Service after September 2, 1974, will be open to public 
inspection regardless of the number of plan participants indicated on 
any prior return or application.
    (c) Plan participant. Solely for purposes of determining who is a 
plan participant permitted to inspect material relating to a plan having 
fewer that 26 participants, the term ``plan participant'' includes, but 
is not limited to, former employees (such as certain retired and 
terminated employees) who have a nonforfeitable right to benefits under 
the plan. An individual who is merely a beneficiary of an employee or 
former employee is not a plan participant, unless the individual is a 
beneficiary of a deceased former employee and is receiving benefits or 
entitled to receive future benefits under the plan. The term ``plan 
participant'' also includes the administrator, executor, or trustee of 
the estate of a deceased plan participant if such administrator, 
executor, or trustee is receiving benefits

[[Page 63]]

or entitled to receive future benefits under the plan in his or her 
official capacity. That material may be available for inspection to an 
individual under this paragraph does not constitute a determination by 
the Internal Revenue Service that the individual is a plan participant 
for any purpose other than inspection under section 6104(a)(1)(B).
    (d) Authorized representative. ``Authorized representative'' means 
the representative of a plan participant designated by the participant 
in writing to inspect material described in Secs. 301.6104(a)-2 and 
301.6104(a)-3. The document designating the authorized representative 
must be signed by the plan participant and must specify that the 
representative is authorized to inspect the material. The document, or a 
copy, must be filed with the office of the Internal Revenue Service in 
which the authorized representative is to inspect the material. A copy 
which is reproduced by a photographic process need not be certified as a 
true and correct copy of the original.

(Secs. 6104(a)(1)(A), 6104(a)(1)(B), and 7805 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954 (72 Stat. 1660, 88 Stat. 940, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 
6104(a)(1)(A), 6104(a)(1)(B), 7805))

Sec. 301.6104(a)-5   Withholding of certain information from public inspection.

    (a) Tax exempt organizations--(1) Trade secrets, patents, processes, 
styles of work, or apparatus. An organization whose application for tax 
exemption is open to public inspection under section 6104(a)(1)(A) and 
Sec. 301.6104(a)-1 may in writing request the withholding of information 
contained in the application or supporting documents which relates to 
any trade secret, patent, process, style of work, or apparatus of the 
organization. The information will be withheld from public inspection if 
the Commissioner determines that the disclosure of such information 
would adversely affect the organization. Requests for withholding 
information from public inspection should be filed with the office with 
which the organization files the documents containing the information. 
The request must clearly identify the material desired to be withheld 
(the document, page, paragraph, and line) and must state why the 
information should not be open to public inspection. The organization 
will be notified of the Commissioner's determination as to whether the 
information will be withheld from public inspection. If the Commissioner 
determines that the information will be disclosed, the organization will 
be given 15 days after notification of the Commissioner's decision to 
contest that decision before the document is disclosed.
    (2) National defense material. The Internal Revenue Service will 
withhold from public inspection any information which is submitted by an 
organization whose application for tax exemption is open to inspection 
under section 6104(a)(1)(A) and Sec. 301.6104(a)-1, if the Commissioner 
determines that public disclosure would adversely affect the national 
defense.
    (b) Pension and other plans--(1) Applicant's exclusion of certain 
information. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, 
information that, in the opinion of the applicant, is of the type 
described in section 6104(a)(1) (C) or (D) should not be included in an 
application for a determination letter, supporting documents, or any 
other document open to inspection under section 6104(a)(1)(B). 
Accordingly, an applicant should not include in an application for a 
determination letter or supporting documents confidential compensation 
information as described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. Neither 
should an applicant include information relating to any trade secret, 
patent, process, style of work or apparatus, the disclosure of which 
would be adverse to the applicant.
    (2) Exception for separate document. The rule that an applicant 
should exclude from an application for a determination letter or other 
documents information of the type in section 6104(a)(1) (C) or (D) does 
not apply--
    (i) In the case of the separate schedule to certain applications for 
a determination letter which is provided for the purpose of setting 
forth confidential compensation information (as described in 
subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) which must be submitted by the 
applicant.
    (ii) If the applicant determines that it is impossible to provide 
the Internal

[[Page 64]]

Revenue Service with sufficient information to support an application 
for a determination letter without submitting what is believed to be 
information of the type described in section 6104(a)(1) (C) or (D), or
    (iii) If the Internal Revenue Service requests that the applicant 
submit information of the type described in section 6104(a)(1) (C) and 
(D).

In a case described in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, 
the applicant is to set forth the information in a document separate 
from the remainder of the application for a determination letter or 
other documents. The separate document is to state why the information 
is to be witheld from public inspection under section 6104(a)(1) (C) or 
(D). If the Internal Revenue Service has not requested the information, 
the separate document is to also state why it is impossible to provide 
the Internal Revenue Service sufficient information to support the 
application for a determination letter without including information 
which is to be withheld. The separate document should clearly identify 
the relevant portion of the application for a determination letter or 
other document (the document, page, paragraph, and line) to which the 
information set forth in the separate document relates. The Internal 
Revenue Service will withhold from public inspection (including 
inspection by a plan participant or authorized representative) 
information contained in the separate document if the Commissioner 
determines that the information is in fact information of the type 
described in section 6104(a)(1) (C) or (D), and, in the case of 
information relating to any trade secret, patent, process, style of work 
or apparatus, the Commissioner further determines that disclosure would 
be adverse to the applicant. If the Commissioner determines that the 
information will be disclosed, the organization will be given 15 days 
after notification of the Commissioner's decision to contest the 
decision before the document is disclosed.
    (3) National defense material. The Internal Revenue Service will 
withhold from public inspection (including inspection by a plan 
participant or authorized representative) any information which is 
included in an application for a determination letter or supporting 
documents if the Commissioner determines that public disclosure would 
adversely affect the national defense. The information will be withheld 
whether or not submitted on a separate document pursuant to subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph.
    (4) Confidential compensation information. If an application for a 
determination letter, supporting document, or related letter or document 
referred to in section 6104(a)(1)(B) and Secs. 301.6104(a)-2 and 
301.6104(a)-3 contains information (including aggregate figures) from 
which an individual's compensation (including deferred compensation) may 
be ascertained, that information is not open to public inspection 
(including inspection by a plan participant or authorized 
representative). Confidential compensation information includes the 
amount of benefit a specific plan participant may expect to receive at 
normal or early retirement age and the amount of the employer's 
contributions under the plan that may be allocated to a specific plan 
participant. However, so long as a plan has more than one participant, 
the amount of benefit provided under the plan to plan participants, in 
general, at normal or early retirement age, or the amount of the 
employer's contributions under the plan that are allocable to plan 
participants, in general, does not constitute confidential compensation 
information. Further, a description of the numbers of individuals 
covered and not covered by a plan, listed by compensation range, does 
not constitute confidential compensation information.

Code of 1954 (72 Stat. 1660, 88 Stat. 940, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C.

other plans. Material relating either to tax exempt organizations or to 
pension and other plans that is open to public inspection under section 
6104(a)(1) and Sec. 301.6104(a)-1 through Sec. 301.6104(a)-3 will be 
made available for inspection at the Freedom of Information Reading

[[Page 65]]

Room, National Office, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution 
Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20224, and in the office of any district 
director of internal revenue.
    (b) Request for inspection--(1) Tax exempt organizations and pension 
and other plans; public inspection. Material relating to either tax 
exempt organizations or pension and other plans that is open to public 
inspection under section 6104(a)(1) and Secs. 301.6104(a)-1 through 
Sec. 301.6104(a)-3 will be available for inspection only upon request. 
If inspection at the National Office is desired, a request should be 
made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: 
Freedom of Information Reading Room, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., 
Washington, D.C. 20224. Requests for inspection in the office of a 
district director should be made in writing to the district director's 
office. The request must describe the material to be inspected in 
reasonably sufficient detail so that Internal Revenue Service personnel 
can locate the material. If a tax-exempt organization has more than one 
application for tax exemption open to public inspection, or if a pension 
or other plan has more than one application for a determination letter 
open to public inspection, only the most recent application and related 
material will be made available for inspection unless the request states 
otherwise. Further, in the case of a pension or other plan, only 
Internal Revenue Service documents issued or delivered after the date of 
the filing of the most recent application for a determination letter 
will be made available for inspection, unless the request states 
otherwise.
    (2) Pension and other plans; inspection by plan participant or 
authorized representative. As described in Sec. 301.6104(a)-4, material 
relating to plans having fewer than 26 participants is only open to

case of such a plan, the rules described in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph apply. The request for inspection must include satisfactory 
evidence that the person requesting inspection is a plan participant 
(see Sec. 301.6104(a)-4(c)) or an authorized representative of such a 
plan participant within the meaning of Sec. 301.6104(a)-4(d).
    (c) Time and extent of inspection. A person requesting inspection 
will be notified when the material will be made available for 
inspection. The material will be made available for inspection at times 
that will not interfere with its use by the Internal Revenue Service or 
exclude other persons from inspecting it. In addition, the Commissioner 
or district director may limit the number of applications for tax 
exemption, applications for a determination letter, supporting 
documents, or letters and documents issued by the Internal Revenue 
Service that will be made available to any person for inspection on a 
given date. Inspection will be allowed only in the presence of an 
Internal Revenue Service employee and only during regular business 
hours.
    (d) Copies.  Notes may be taken of the material open for inspection. 
Copies may be made manually or, if a person provides the equipment, 
photographically at the place of inspection. Photographic copying is 
subject to reasonable supervision with regard to the facilities and 
equipment used. A fee will be charged for copies of the material 
furnished by the Internal Revenue Service. Copies will be certified upon 
request.

made available for public inspection at such reasonable and proper 
times, and under such conditions, that will not interfere with their use 
by the Internal Revenue Service and will not exclude other persons from 
inspecting them. In addition the Commissioner, Director of the Service 
Center, or district director may limit the number of returns to be made 
available to any person for inspection on a given date. Inspection will

<R05>
Sec. 301.6104(c)-1   Disclosure of certain information to State officers.

    (a) Notification of determinations-- (1) Automatic notification. 
Upon making a determination described in paragraph (c) of this section, 
the Internal Revenue Service will notify the Attorney General and the 
principal tax officer of each of the following States of such 
determination without application or request by such State officer--
    (i) In the case of any organization described in section 501(c)(3), 
the State in which the principal office of the organization is located 
(as shown on the last-filed return required by section 6033, or on the 
application for exemption if no return has been filed), and the State in 
which the organization was incorporated, or if a trust, in which it was 
created, and
    (ii) In the case of a private foundation, each State which the 
organization was required to list as an attachment to its last-filed 
return pursuant to Sec. 1.6033-2(a)(2)(iv).
    (2) Applications for notification by other State officers. Other 
officers of States described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and 
officers of States not described in such subparagraph, may request that 
they be notified (either generally or with respect to a particular 
organization or type of organization) of determinations described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. In such cases, these State officers must 
show that they are appropriate State officers within the meaning of 
section 6104(c)(2). The required showing may be made by presenting a 
letter from the Attorney General of the State setting forth (i) the 
functions and authority of the State officer under State law, and (ii) 
sufficient facts for the Internal Revenue Service to determine that such 
officer is an appropriate State officer within the meaning of section 
6104(c)(2).
    (3) Manner of notification. A State officer who is entitled to be 
notified of a determination under this paragraph will be notified by 
sending him a copy of the communication from the Internal Revenue 
Service to the organization which informs such organization of the 
determination.
    (b) Inspection by State officers--(1) In general. After a 
determination described in paragraph (c) of this section has been made, 
appropriate State officers within the meaning of section 6104(c)(2) may 
inspect the material described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. 
Such material may be inspected at an office of the Internal Revenue 
Service which will be designated upon receipt of a request for 
inspection; the location of such office will be determined with due 
consideration of the needs of the Internal Revenue Service and the needs 
of the State officer entitled to inspect.
    (2) State officers who may inspect material. Any State officer 
entitled to be notified of a determination without application (under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) may inspect the material described in 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph upon demonstrating that he is so 
entitled. Any State officer who has in fact been notified by the 
Internal Revenue Service of a determination may inspect such material 
without further demonstration, unless it shall be determined by the 
Internal Revenue Service that such officer was not entitled to be so 
notified. Other State officers must demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Internal Revenue Service that they are entitled to be notified under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section before they may inspect such material.
    (3) Material which may be inspected. (i) Except as provided in 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a State officer who is so 
entitled under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph will be 
permitted to inspect and copy all returns, filed statements, records, 
reports, and

[[Page 68]]

other information relating to a determination described in paragraph (c) 
of this section which is relevant to a determination under State law, 
and which is in the hands of the Internal Revenue Service.
    (ii) The following material will not be made available for 
inspection by State officers under section 6104(c) and this section--
    (a) Interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or other federal 
agency of federal laws (including the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and 
its predecessors) which would not otherwise be made available to State 
officers under section 6103(d),
    (b) Reports of informers, or any other material which would disclose 
the identity, or threaten the safety or anonymity, of an informer,
    (c) Returns of persons (other than those exempt from taxation) which 
would not be available under section 6103(d) to the State officer 
requesting inspection, or
    (d) Other material the disclosure of which the Commissioner has 
determined would prejudice the proper administration of the internal 
revenue laws.
    (4) Statement by State officer. Before any State officer will be 
permitted to inspect material described in this paragraph, he must 
submit a statement to the Internal Revenue Service that he intends to 
use such material solely in fulfilling his functions under State law 
relating to organizations of the type described in section 501(c)(3); 
material is made available to State officers under this section in 
reliance on such statements. For provisions relating to penalties for 
misuse of information which is made available under section 6104(c) and 
this section, see 18 U.S.C. 1001.
    (c) Determinations defined. For purposes of this section, a 
determination means a final determination by the Internal Revenue 
Service that--
    (1) An organization is refused recognition as an organization 
described in section 501(c)(3), or has been operated in such a manner 
that it will not, or will no longer, be recognized as meeting the 
requirements for exemption under that section, or
    (2) A deficiency of tax exists under section 507 or chapter 41 or 
42.

For purposes of this paragraph, a determination by the Internal Revenue 
Service is not final until all administrative review with respect to 
such determination has been completed. For purposes of this section, a 
waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of deficiency in tax 
is treated as a final determination that a deficiency of tax exists when 
such waiver has been finally accepted by the Internal Revenue Service. 
For example, a final determination that a deficiency of tax exists under 
section 507 or chapter 41 or 42 is made when the organization is sent a 
notice of deficiency with respect to such tax.
    (d) Effective date. The provisions of this section apply with 
respect to all determinations made after December 31, 1969.

Sec. 301.6104(d)-1   Public inspection of private foundations' annual returns.

    (a) In general. The annual return which a private foundation must 
file under section 6056 shall be made available by its foundation 
managers for inspection at its principal office during regular business 
hours by any citizen on request made within 180 days after the 
publication of notice of the availability of such return. Such notice 
shall be published not later than the day prescribed for filing such 
return (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing) in a 
newspaper having general circulation in the county in which the 
foundation's principal office is located. The notice shall state that 
the annual return is available at the foundation's principal office for 
inspection during regular business hours by any citizen who requests 
inspection

[[Page 69]]

within 180 days after the date of such publication, and shall state the 
address of the foundation's principal office and the name of its 
principal manager.
    (b) Definitions and special rules--(1) Private foundation. For 
purposes of this section, the term ``private foundation'' includes both 
exempt and nonexempt private foundations and also includes trusts 
described in section 4947(a)(1) that are treated as private foundations 
for purposes of section 6033.
    (2) Manner of making annual return available for public inspection. 
The foundation managers of a private foundation which has no principal 
office, or whose principal office is in a personal residence, may 
satisfy the requirement that the annual return be made available for 
public inspection at the foundation's principal office by having the 
return available for public inspection at an appropriate substitute 
location or by furnishing a copy free of charge (including postage and 
copying) to persons who request inspection in the manner and at the time 
prescribed therefor in section 6104(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
In addition to its principal office, a private foundation may designate 
an additional location at which its annual return shall be made 
available in the manner and at the time prescribed therefor in section 
6104(d).
    (3) Newspaper having general circulation. The term ``newspaper 
having general circulation'' in section 6104(d) shall include any 
newspaper or journal which is permitted to publish statements in 
satisfaction of State statutory requirements relating to transfers of 
title to real estate or other similar legal notices.
    (4) Principal manager. A private foundation may furnish the name of 
its ``principal manager'' in the notice required by section 6104(d) by 
furnishing the name of the individual foundation manager who is 
responsible for publishing such notice or for making the annual return 
available for inspection under section 6104(d).
    (c) Cross-reference. For additional rules with respect to private 
foundations' annual returns and their public inspection, see section 
6033 and the regulations thereunder.

    Pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of section 6105,

<R05>
Sec. 301.6109-1   Identifying numbers.

    (a) In general--(1) Taxpayer identifying numbers--(i) Types. There 
are generally three types of taxpayer identifying numbers: social 
security numbers, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) individual taxpayer 
identification numbers, and employer identification numbers. Social 
security numbers take the form 000-00-0000, IRS individual taxpayer 
identification numbers take the form 000-00-0000 but begin with a 
specific number designated by the IRS, and employer identification 
numbers take the form 00-0000000. Both social security numbers and IRS 
individual taxpayer

[[Page 70]]

identification numbers identify individual persons. For the definition 
of social security number and employer identification number, see 
Secs. 301.7701-11 and 301.7701-12, respectively. For the definition of 
IRS individual taxpayer identification number, see paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section.
    (ii) Uses. Except as otherwise provided in applicable regulations 
under this title or on a return, statement, or other document, and 
related instructions, taxpayer identifying numbers must be used as 
follows:
    (A) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) (B) and 
(D) of this section, an individual required to furnish a taxpayer 
identifying number must use a social security number.
    (B) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of this 
section, an individual required to furnish a taxpayer identifying number 
but who is not eligible to obtain a social security number, must use an 
IRS individual taxpayer identification number.
    (C) Any person other than an individual (such as corporations, 
partnerships, nonprofit associations, trusts, estates, and similar 
nonindividual persons) that is required to furnish a taxpayer 
identifying number must use an employer identification number.
    (D) An individual, whether U.S. or foreign, who is an employer or 
who is engaged in a trade or business as a sole proprietor should use an 
employer identification number as required by returns, statements, or 
other documents and their related instructions.
    (2) A trust all of which is treated as owned by the grantor or 
another person pursuant to sections 671 through 678--(i) Obtaining a 
taxpayer identification number. If a trust does not have a taxpayer 
identification number and the trustee furnishes the name and taxpayer 
identification number of the grantor or other person treated as the 
owner of the trust and the address of the trust to all payors pursuant 
to Sec. 1.671-4(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter, the trustee need not obtain 
a taxpayer identification number for the trust until either the first 
taxable year of the trust in which all of the trust is no longer owned 
by the grantor or another person, or until the first taxable year of the 
trust for which the trustee no longer reports pursuant to Sec. 1.671-
4(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter. If the trustee has not already obtained a 
taxpayer identification number for the trust, the trustee must obtain a 
taxpayer identification number for the trust as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section in order to report pursuant to Sec. 1.671-4(a), 
(b)(2)(i)(B), or (b)(3)(i) of this chapter.
    (ii) Obligations of persons who make payments to certain trusts. Any 
payor that is required to file an information return with respect to 
payments of income or proceeds to a trust must show the name and 
taxpayer identification number that the trustee has furnished to the 
payor on the return. Regardless of whether the trustee furnishes to the 
payor the name and taxpayer identification number of the grantor or 
other person treated as an owner of the trust, or the name and taxpayer 
identification number of the trust, the payor must furnish a statement 
to recipients to the trustee of the trust, rather than to the grantor or 
other person treated as the owner of the trust. Under these 
circumstances, the payor satisfies the obligation to show the name and 
taxpayer identification number of the payee on the information return 
and to furnish a statement to recipients to the person whose taxpayer 
identification number is required to be shown on the form.
    (iii) Persons treated as payors. For purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(2), the term payor means a person described in Sec. 1.671-4(b)(4) of 
this chapter.
    (b) Requirement to furnish one's own number--(1) U.S. persons. Every 
U.S. person who makes under this title a return, statement, or other 
document must furnish its own taxpayer identifying number as required by 
the forms and the accompanying instructions. A U.S. person whose number 
must be included on a document filed by another person must give the 
taxpayer identifying number so required to the other person on request. 
For penalties for failure to supply taxpayer identifying numbers, see 
sections 6721 through 6724. For provisions dealing specifically with the 
duty of employees with respect to their social security numbers, see 
Sec. 31.6011(b)-2 (a) and (b) of this chapter (Employment Tax 
Regulations). For

[[Page 71]]

provisions dealing specifically with the duty of employers with respect 
to employer identification numbers, see Sec. 31.6011(b)-1 of this 
chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
    (2) Foreign persons. The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section regarding the furnishing of one's own number shall apply to the 
following foreign persons--
    (i) A foreign person that has income effectively connected with the 
conduct of a U.S. trade or business at any time during the taxable year;
    (ii) A foreign person that has a U.S. office or place of business or 
a U.S. fiscal or paying agent at any time during the taxable year;
    (iii) A nonresident alien treated as a resident under section 
6013(g) or (h);
    (iv) Any other foreign person who, with respect to taxes imposed 
under this title (including income, estate, and gift taxes), makes a 
return of tax, an amended return, or a refund claim, but excluding 
information returns, statements, or documents; and
    (v) A foreign person that makes an election under Sec. 301.7701-
3(c).
    (c) Requirement to furnish another's number. Every person required 
under this title to make a return, statement, or other document must 
furnish such taxpayer identifying numbers of other U.S. persons and 
foreign persons that are described in paragraph (b)(2)(i), (ii), or 
(iii) of this section as required by the forms and the accompanying 
instructions. If the person making the return, statement, or other 
document does not know the taxpayer identifying number of the other 
person, such person must request the other person's number. A request 
should state that the identifying number is required to be furnished 
under authority of law. When the person making the return, statement, or 
other document does not know the number of the other person, and has 
complied with the request provision of this paragraph, such person must 
sign an affidavit on the transmittal document forwarding such returns, 
statements, or other documents to the Internal Revenue Service, so 
stating. A person required to file a taxpayer identifying number shall 
correct any errors in such filing when such person's attention has been 
drawn to them.
    (d) Obtaining a taxpayer identifying number--(1) Social security 
number. Any individual required to furnish a social security number 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall apply for one, if he has 
not done so previously, on Form SS-5, which may be obtained from any 
Social Security Administration or Internal Revenue Service office. He 
shall make such application far enough in advance of the first required 
use of such number to permit issuance of the number in time for 
compliance with such requirement. The form, together with any 
supplementary statement, shall be prepared and filed in accordance with 
the form, instructions, and regulations applicable thereto, and shall 
set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. Individuals who 
are ineligible for or do not wish to participate in the benefits of the 
social security program shall nevertheless obtain a social security 
number if they are required to furnish such a number pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Employer identification number--(i) In general. Any person 
required to furnish an employer identification number must apply for 
one, if not done so previously, on Form SS-4. A Form SS-4 may be 
obtained from any office of the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. consular 
office abroad, or from an acceptance agent described in paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv) of this section. The person must make such application far 
enough in advance of the first required use of the employer 
identification number to permit issuance of the number in time for 
compliance with such requirement. The form, together with any 
supplementary statement, must be prepared and filed in accordance with 
the form, accompanying instructions, and relevant regulations, and must 
set forth fully and clearly the requested data.
    (ii) Special rule for entities electing to change their federal tax 
classification under Sec. 301.7701-3(c). Any entity that has an employer 
identification number and then elects under Sec. 301.7701-3(c) to change 
its federal tax classification will retain that employer identification 
number.
    (3) IRS individual taxpayer identification number--(i) Definition. 
The term IRS individual taxpayer identification

[[Page 72]]

number means a taxpayer identifying number issued to an alien individual 
by the Internal Revenue Service, upon application, for use in connection 
with filing requirements under this title. The term IRS individual 
taxpayer identification number does not refer to a social security 
number or an account number for use in employment for wages. For 
purposes of this section, the term alien individual means an individual 
who is not a citizen or national of the United States.
    (ii) General rule for obtaining number. Any individual who is not 
eligible to obtain a social security number and is required to furnish a 
taxpayer identifying number must apply for an IRS individual taxpayer 
identification number on Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual 
Taxpayer Identification Number, or such other form as may be prescribed 
by the Internal Revenue Service. Form W-7 may be obtained from any 
office of the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. consular office abroad, or 
any acceptance agent described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section. 
The individual shall furnish the information required by the form and 
accompanying instructions, including the individual's name, address, 
foreign tax identification number (if any), and specific reason for 
obtaining an IRS individual taxpayer identification number. The 
individual must make such application far enough in advance of the first 
required use of the IRS individual taxpayer identification number to 
permit issuance of the number in time for compliance with such 
requirement. The application form, together with any supplementary 
statement and documentation, must be prepared and filed in accordance 
with the form, accompanying instructions, and relevant regulations, and 
must set forth fully and clearly the requested data.
    (iii) General rule for assigning number. Under procedures issued by 
the Internal Revenue Service, an IRS individual taxpayer identification 
number will be assigned to an individual upon the basis of information 
reported on Form W-7 (or such other form as may be prescribed by the 
Internal Revenue Service) and any such accompanying documentation that 
may be required by the Internal Revenue Service. An applicant for an IRS 
individual taxpayer identification number must submit such documentary 
evidence as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in order to 
establish alien status and identity. Examples of acceptable documentary 
evidence for this purpose may include items such as an original (or a 
certified copy of the original) passport, driver's license, birth 
certificate, identity card, or immigration documentation.
    (iv) Acceptance agents--(A) Agreements with acceptance agents. A 
person described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section will be 
accepted by the Internal Revenue Service to act as an acceptance agent 
for purposes of the regulations under this section upon entering into an 
agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, under which the acceptance 
agent will be authorized to act on behalf of taxpayers seeking to obtain 
a taxpayer identifying number from the Internal Revenue Service. The 
agreement must contain such terms and conditions as are necessary to 
insure proper administration of the process by which the Internal 
Revenue Service issues taxpayer identifying numbers to foreign persons, 
including proof of their identity and foreign status. In particular, the 
agreement may contain--
    (1) Procedures for providing Form SS-4 and Form W-7, or such other 
necessary form to applicants for obtaining a taxpayer identifying 
number;
    (2) Procedures for providing assistance to applicants in completing 
the application form or completing it for them;
    (3) Procedures for collecting, reviewing, and maintaining, in the 
normal course of business, a record of the required documentation for 
assignment of a taxpayer identifying number;
    (4) Procedures for submitting the application form and required 
documentation to the Internal Revenue Service, or if permitted under the 
agreement, submitting the application form together with a certification 
that the acceptance agent has reviewed the required documentation and 
that it has no actual knowledge or reason to know that the documentation 
is not complete or accurate;
    (5) Procedures for assisting taxpayers with notification procedures 
described

[[Page 73]]

in paragraph (g)(2) of this section in the event of change of foreign 
status;
    (6) Procedures for making all documentation or other records 
furnished by persons applying for a taxpayer identifying number promptly 
available for review by the Internal Revenue Service, upon request; and
    (7) Provisions that the agreement may be terminated in the event of 
a material failure to comply with the agreement, including failure to 
exercise due diligence under the agreement.
    (B) Persons who may be acceptance agents. An acceptance agent may 
include any financial institution as defined in section 265(b)(5) or 
Sec. 1.165-12(c)(1)(v) of this chapter, any college or university that 
is an educational organization as defined in Sec. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(3)(i) 
of this chapter, any federal agency as defined in section 6402(f) or any 
other person or categories of persons that may be authorized by 
regulations or Internal Revenue Service procedures. A person described 
in this paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) that seeks to qualify as an acceptance 
agent must have an employer identification number for use in any 
communication with the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, it must 
establish to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that it 
has adequate resources and procedures in place to comply with the terms 
of the agreement described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section.
    (4) Coordination of taxpayer identifying numbers--(i) Social 
security number. Any individual who is duly assigned a social security 
number or who is entitled to a social security number will not be issued 
an IRS individual taxpayer identification number. The individual can use 
the social security number for all tax purposes under this title, even 
though the individual is, or later becomes, a nonresident alien 
individual. Further, any individual who has an application pending with 
the Social Security Administration will be issued an IRS individual 
taxpayer identification number only after the Social Security 
Administration has notified the individual that a social security number 
cannot be issued. Any alien individual duly issued an IRS individual 
taxpayer identification number who later becomes a U.S. citizen, or an 
alien lawfully permitted to enter the United States either for permanent 
residence or under authority of law permitting U.S. employment, will be 
required to obtain a social security number. Any individual who has an 
IRS individual taxpayer identification number and a social security 
number, due to the circumstances described in the preceding sentence, 
must notify the Internal Revenue Service of the acquisition of the 
social security number and must use the newly-issued social security 
number as the taxpayer identifying number on all future returns, 
statements, or other documents filed under this title.
    (ii) Employer identification number. Any individual with both a 
social security number (or an IRS individual taxpayer identification 
number) and an employer identification number may use the social 
security number (or the IRS individual taxpayer identification number) 
for individual taxes, and the employer identification number for 
business taxes as required by returns, statements, and other documents 
and their related instructions. Any alien individual duly assigned an 
IRS individual taxpayer identification number who also is required to 
obtain an employer identification number must furnish the previously-
assigned IRS individual taxpayer identification number to the Internal 
Revenue Service on Form SS-4 at the time of application for the employer 
identification number. Similarly, where an alien individual has an 
employer identification number and is required to obtain an IRS 
individual taxpayer identification number, the individual must furnish 
the previously-assigned employer identification number to the Internal 
Revenue Service on Form W-7, or such other form as may be prescribed by 
the Internal Revenue Service, at the time of application for the IRS 
individual taxpayer identification number.
    (e) Banks, and brokers and dealers in securities. For additional 
requirements relating to deposits, share accounts, and brokerage 
accounts, see 31 CFR 103.34 and 103.35.
    (f) Penalty. For penalties for failure to supply taxpayer 
identifying numbers, see sections 6721 through 6724.
    (g) Special rules for taxpayer identifying numbers issued to foreign 
persons--(1)

[[Page 74]]

General rule--(i) Social security number. A social security number is 
generally identified in the records and database of the Internal Revenue 
Service as a number belonging to a U.S. citizen or resident alien 
individual. A person may establish a different status for the number by 
providing proof of foreign status with the Internal Revenue Service 
under such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service shall prescribe, 
including the use of a form as the Internal Revenue Service may specify. 
Upon accepting an individual as a nonresident alien individual, the 
Internal Revenue Service will assign this status to the individual's 
social security number.
    (ii) Employer identification number. An employer identification 
number is generally identified in the records and database of the 
Internal Revenue Service as a number belonging to a U.S. person. 
However, the Internal Revenue Service may establish a separate class of 
employer identification numbers solely dedicated to foreign persons 
which will be identified as such in the records and database of the 
Internal Revenue Service. A person may establish a different status for 
the number either at the time of application or subsequently by 
providing proof of U.S. or foreign status with the Internal Revenue 
Service under such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service shall 
prescribe, including the use of a form as the Internal Revenue Service 
may specify. The Internal Revenue Service may require a person to apply 
for the type of employer identification number that reflects the status 
of that person as a U.S. or foreign person.
    (iii) IRS individual taxpayer identification number. An IRS 
individual taxpayer identification number is generally identified in the 
records and database of the Internal Revenue Service as a number 
belonging to a nonresident alien individual. If the Internal Revenue 
Service determines at the time of application or subsequently, that an 
individual is not a nonresident alien individual, the Internal Revenue 
Service may require that the individual apply for a social security 
number. If a social security number is not available, the Internal 
Revenue Service may accept that the individual use an IRS individual 
taxpayer identification number, which the Internal Revenue Service will 
identify as a number belonging to a U.S. resident alien.
    (2) Change of foreign status. Once a taxpayer identifying number is 
identified in the records and database of the Internal Revenue Service 
as a number belonging to a U.S. or foreign person, the status of the 
number is permanent until the circumstances of the taxpayer change. A 
taxpayer whose status changes (for example, a nonresident alien 
individual with a social security number becomes a U.S. resident alien) 
must notify the Internal Revenue Service of the change of status under 
such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service shall prescribe, 
including the use of a form as the Internal Revenue Service may specify.
    (3) Waiver of prohibition to disclose taxpayer information when 
acceptance agent acts. As part of its request for an IRS individual 
taxpayer identification number or submission of proof of foreign status 
with respect to any taxpayer identifying number, where the foreign 
person acts through an acceptance agent, the foreign person will agree 
to waive the limitations in section 6103 regarding the disclosure of 
certain taxpayer information. However, the waiver will apply only for 
purposes of permitting the Internal Revenue Service and the acceptance 
agent to communicate with each other regarding matters related to the 
assignment of a taxpayer identifying number and change of foreign 
status.
    (h) Effective date--(1) General rule. Except as otherwise provided 
in this paragraph (h), the provisions of this section are generally 
effective for information that must be furnished after April 15, 1974. 
However, the provisions relating to IRS individual taxpayer 
identification numbers apply on and after May 29, 1996. An application 
for an IRS individual taxpayer identification number (Form W-7) may be 
filed at any time on or after July 1, 1996.
    (2) Special rules--(i) Employer identification number of an estate. 
The requirement under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of this section that an 
estate obtain an employer identification number applies on and after 
January 1, 1984.

[[Page 75]]

    (ii) Taxpayer identifying numbers of certain foreign persons. The 
requirement under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section that certain 
foreign persons furnish a TIN on a return of tax is effective for tax 
returns filed after December 31, 1996.

Sec. 301.6109-2  Authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to collect employer identification numbers for purposes of the Food Stamp Act of 1977.

    (a) In general. The Secretary of Agriculture may require each 
applicant retail food store or wholesale food concern to furnish its 
employer identification number in connection with the administration of 
section 9 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2018) (relating to the 
determination of the qualifications of applicants under the Food Stamp 
Act).
    (b) Limited purpose. The Secretary of Agriculture may have access to 
the employer identification numbers obtained pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, but only for the purpose of establishing and 
maintaining a list of the names and employer identification numbers of 
the stores and concerns for use in determining those applicants who have 
been previously sanctioned or convicted under section 12 or 15 of the 
Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2021 or 2024). The Secretary of 
Agriculture may use this determination of sanctions and convictions in 
administering section 9 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977.
    (c) Sharing of information--(1) Sharing permitted with certain 
United States agencies and instrumentalities. The Secretary of 
Agriculture may share the information contained in the list described in 
paragraph (b) of this section with any other agency or instrumentality 
of the United States that otherwise has access to employer 
identification numbers, but only to the extent the Secretary of 
Agriculture determines sharing such information will assist in verifying 
and matching that information against information maintained by the 
other agency or instrumentality.
    (2) Restrictions on the use of shared information. The information 
shared by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to this section may be 
used by any other agency or instrumentality of the United States only 
for the purpose of effective administration and enforcement of the Food 
Stamp Act of 1977 or for the purpose of investigation of violations of 
other Federal laws or enforcement of those laws.
    (d) Safeguards--(1) Restrictions on access to employer 
identification numbers by individuals--(i) Numbers maintained by the 
Secretary of Agriculture. The individuals who are permitted access to 
employer identification numbers obtained pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section and maintained by the Secretary of Agriculture are officers 
and employees of the United States whose duties or responsibilities 
require access to such employer identification numbers for the purpose 
of effective administration or enforcement of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 
or for the purpose of sharing the information in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (ii) Numbers maintained by any other agency or instrumentality. The 
individuals who are permitted access to employer identification numbers 
obtained pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section and maintained by any 
agency or instrumentality of the United States other than the Department 
of Agriculture are officers and employees of the United States whose 
duties or responsibilities require access to such employer 
identification numbers for the purpose of effective administration and 
enforcement of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 or for the purpose of 
investigation of violations of other Federal laws or enforcement of 
those laws.
    (2) Other safeguards. The Secretary of Agriculture, and the head of 
any other agency or instrumentality referred to in paragraph (c) of this 
section, must provide for any additional safeguards that the Secretary 
of the Treasury determines to be necessary or appropriate to protect the 
confidentiality of the employer identification numbers. The Secretary of 
Agriculture, and the head of any other agency or instrumentality 
referred to in paragraph (c) of

[[Page 76]]

this section, may also provide for any additional safeguards to protect 
the confidentiality of employer identification numbers, provided these 
safeguards are consistent with safeguards determined by the Secretary of 
the Treasury to be necessary or appropriate.
    (e) Confidentiality and disclosure of employer identification 
numbers. Employer identification numbers obtained pursuant to paragraph 
(a) or (c) of this section are confidential. No officer or employee of 
the United States who has or had access to any such employer 
identification number may disclose that number in any manner to an 
individual not described in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes 
of this paragraph (e), officer or employee includes a former officer or 
employee.
    (f) Sanctions--(1) Unauthorized, willful disclosure of employer 
identification numbers. Sections 7213(a) (1), (2), and (3) apply with 
respect to the unauthorized, willful disclosure to any person of 
employer identification numbers that are maintained pursuant to this 
section by the Secretary of Agriculture, or any other agency or 
instrumentality with which information is shared pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section, in the same manner and to the same extent as 
sections 7213(a) (1), (2), and (3) apply with respect to unauthorized 
disclosures of returns and return information described in those

material value in exchange for any employer identification number 
maintained pursuant to this section by the Secretary of Agriculture, or 
any other agency or instrumentality with which information is shared

same extent as section 7213(a)(4) applies with respect to offers (in 
exchange for any return or return information) described in that 
section.

(b)(3) of this section, relating to general written determinations 
relating to accounting or funding periods and methods, the text of any 
written determination (as defined in Sec. 301.6110-2(a)) issued pursuant 
to a request postmarked or hand delivered after October 31, 1976, shall 
be open to public inspection in the places provided in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section. The text of any written determination issued pursuant 
to a request postmarked or hand delivered before November 1, 1976, shall 
be open to public inspection pursuant to section 6110(h) and 
Sec. 301.6110-6, when funds are appropriated by Congress for such 
purpose. The procedures and rules set forth in Secs. 301.6110-1 through 
301.6110-5 and 301.6110-7 do not apply to written determinations issued 
pursuant to requests postmarked or hand delivered before November 1, 
1976, unless Sec. 301.6110-6 states otherwise. There shall also be open 
to public inspection in each place of public inspection an index to the 
written determinations open or subject to inspection at such place. Each 
such index shall be arranged by section of the Internal Revenue Code, 
related statute, or tax treaty and by subject matter description with 
such section in such manner as the Commissioner may from time to time 
provide. The Commissioner shall not be required to make any written 
determination or background file document open to public inspection 
pursuant to section 6110 or refrain from disclosure

[[Page 77]]

of any such documents or any information therein, except as provided by 
section 6110 or with respect to a discovery order made in connection 
with a judicial proceeding. The provisions of section 6110 shall not 
apply to matters for which the determination of whether public 
inspection should occur is made pursuant to section 6104. Matters within 
the ambit of section 6104 include: Any application filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service with respect to the qualification or exempt 
status of an organization, plan, or account described in section 
6104(a)(1), whether the plan or account has more than 25 or less than 26 
participants; any document issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 
which the qualification or exempt status of an organization, plan, or 
account described in section 6104 (a)(1) is granted, denied or revoked 
or the portion of any document in which technical advice with respect 
thereto is given to a district director; any application filed, and any 
document issued by the Internal Revenue Service, with respect to the 
qualification or status of master, prototype, and pattern employee 
plans; the portion of any document issued by the Internal Revenue 
Service in which is discussed the effect on the qualification or exempt 
status of an organization, plan, or account described in section 
6104(a)(1) of proposed transactions by such organization, plan, or 
account; and any document issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 
which is discussed the qualification or status of an organization 
described in section 509(a) or 4942(j)(3), but not including any 
document issued to nonexempt charitable trusts described in section 
4947(a)(1).
    (b) Items that may be inspected only under certain circumstances--
(1) Background file documents. A background file document (as such term 
is defined in Sec. 301.6110-2(g)) relating to a particular written 
determination issued pursuant to a request postmarked or hand delivered 
after October 31, 1976, shall not be subject to inspection until such 
written determination is open to public inspection or available for 
inspection pursuant to paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section, and 
then only if a written request pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section is made for inspection of such background file document. 
Background file documents relating to written determinations issued 
pursuant to requests postmarked or hand delivered before November 1, 
1976, shall be subject to inspection pursuant to section 6110 (h) and 
Sec. 301.6110-6, when funds are appropriated by Congress for such 
purpose. The version of the background file document which is available 
for inspection shall be the version originally made available for 
inspection, as modified by any additional disclosure pursuant to section 
6110(d)(3) and (f)(4).
    (2) Technical advice memoranda involving civil fraud and criminal 
investigations, jeopardy and termination assessments. Any technical 
advice memorandum (as such term is defined in Sec. 301.6110-2(f) 
involving any matter that is the subject of a civil fraud or criminal 
investigation, a jeopardy assessment (as such term is defined in section 
6861), or a termination assessment (as such term is defined in section 
6851) shall not be subject to inspection until all actions relating to 
such investigation or assessment are completed and then only if a 
written request pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section is made for 
inspection of such technical advice memorandum. A ``civil fraud 
investigation'' is any administrative step or judicial proceeding in 
which an issue for determination is whether the Commissioner should 
impose additional tax pursuant to section 6653(b). A ``criminal 
investigation'' is any administrative step or judicial proceeding in 
which an issue for determination is whether a taxpayer should be charged 
with or is guility of criminal conduct. An action relating to a civil 
fraud or criminal investigation includes any such administrative step or 
judicial proceeding, the review of subsequent related activities and 
related returns of the taxpayer or related taxpayers, and

[[Page 78]]

any other administrative step or judicial procedure or proceeding or 
appellate process that is initiated as a consequence of the facts and 
circumstances disclosed by such investigation. An action relating to a 
jeopardy or termination assessment includes any administrative step or 
judicial proceeding that is initiated to determine whether to make such 
assessment, that is brought pursuant to section 7429 to determine the 
appropriateness or reasonableness of such assessment, or that is brought 
to resolve the legal consequences of the tax status or liability issue 
underlying the making of such assessment. Any action relating to a civil 
fraud or criminal investigation, a jeopardy assessment, or a termination 
assessment is not completed until all available administrative steps and 
judicial proceedings and remedies, including appeals, have been 
completed.
    (3) Written determinations with respect to adoption of or change in 
certain accounting or funding periods and methods. Any general written 
determination (as defined in Sec. 301.6110-2(c) that relates solely to 
approval of any adoption of or change in--
    (i) The funding method or plan year of a plan under section 412.
    (ii) A taxpayer's annual accounting period under section 442.
    (iii) A taxpayer's method of accounting under section 446(e), or
    (iv) A partnership's or partner's taxable year under section 706

shall not be subject to inspection until such written determination 
would, but for this paragraph (b)(3), be open to public inspection 
pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-5(c) and then only if a written request 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section is made for inspection of 
such written determination.
    (c) Procecure for public inspection-- (1) Place of public 
inspection. The text of any ruling (as such term is defined in 
Sec. 301.6110-2(d) or technical advice memorandum that is open to public 
inspection pursuant to section 6110 shall be located in the National 
Office Reading Room. The text of any determination letter (as such term 
is defined in Sec. 301.6110-2(e)) that is open to public inspection 
pursuant to section 6110 shall be located in the Reading Room of the 
Regional Office in which is located the district office that issued such 
determination letter. Inspection of any written determination subject to 
inspection only upon written request shall be requested from the 
National Office Reading Room. Inspection of any background file document 
shall be requested only from the reading room in which the related 
written determination is either open to public inspection or subject to 
inspection upon written request. The locations and mailing addresses of 
the reading rooms are set forth in Sec. 601.702(b)(3)(ii) of this 
chapter.
    (2) Time and manner of public inspection. The inspection authorized 
by section 6110 will be allowed only in the place provided for such 
inspection in the presence of an Internal Revenue officer or employee 
and only during the regular hours of business of the Internal Revenue 
Service office in which the reading room is located. The public will not 
be allowed to remove any record from a reading room. A person who wishes 
to inspect reading room material without visiting a reading room may 
submit a written request pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section 
for copies of any such material to the Internal Revenue Service reading 
room in which is located such material.
    (3) Copies. Notes may be taken of any material open to public 
inspection under section 6110, and copies may be made manually. Copies 
of any material open to public inspection or subject to inspection upon 
written request will be furnished by the Internal Revenue Service to any 
person making requests therefor pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section. If made at the time of inspection the request for copies need 
not be in writing, unless the material is not immediately available for 
copying. The Commissioner may prescribe fees pursuant to section 6110(j) 
for furnishing copies of material open or subject to inspection.
    (4) Requests. Any request for copies of written determinations, for 
inspection of general written determinations relating to accounting or 
funding periods and methods or technical advice memoranda involving 
civil fraud and criminal investigations, and jeopardy

[[Page 79]]

determinations relating to accounting or funding periods and methods, 
the day, week, or month of issuance of such written determination, and 
the applicable category as selected from a special summary listing of 
categories prepared by the Internal Revenue Service;

determination, but not including communications described in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section, and
    (iv) Any subsequent communication between the National Office and a

Revenue Service or the Office of its Chief Counsel relating to any 
pending civil or criminal case or investigation,
    (ii) Communication between Internal Revenue Service employees and

    (h) Issuance. ``Issuance'' of a written determination occurs, with 
respect to rulings and determination letters, upon the mailing of the 
ruling or determination letter to the person to whom it pertains.

the technical advice memorandum by the district director.
    (i) Person to whom written determination pertains. A ``person to 
whom a written determination pertains'' is the person by whom a ruling

representative, the person on whose behalf the request is made. With 
respect to a technical advice memorandum, a ``person to whom a written 
determination pertains'' is the taxpayer whose return is being examined

in interest notifies the Commissioner with respect to the succession in 
interest.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6110-3  Deletion of certain information in written determinations open to public inspection.

    (a) Information subject to deletion. There shall be deleted from the 
text of any written determination open to public inspection or subject 
to inspection upon written request and background file document subject 
to inspection upon written request pursuant to section 6110 the 
following types of information:
    (1) Identifying details. (i) The names, addresses, and identifying 
numbers (including telephone, license, social security, employer 
identification, credit card, and selective service numbers) of any 
person, other than the identifying details of a person who makes a 
third-party communication described in Sec. 301.6110-4(a), and
    (ii) Any other information that would permit a person generally 
knowledgeable with respect to the appropriate community to identify any 
person. The determination of whether information would permit 
identification of a particular person will be made in view of 
information available to the public at the time the written 
determination or background file document is made open or subject to 
inspection and in view of information that will subsequently become 
available, provided the Internal Revenue Service is made aware of such 
information and the potential that such information may identify any 
person. The ``appropriate community'' is that group of persons who would 
be able to associate a particular person with a category of transactions 
one of which is described in the written determination or background 
file document. The appropriate community may vary according to the 
nature of the transaction which is the subject of the written 
determination. For example, if a steel company proposes to enter a 
transaction involving the purchase and installation of blast furnaces, 
the ``appropriate community'' may include all steel producers and blast 
furnace manufacturers, but if the installation process is a unique 
process of which everyone in national industry is aware, the 
``appropriate community'' might also include the national industrial 
community. On the other hand, if the steel company proposes to enter a 
transaction involving the purchase of land on which to construct a 
building to house the blast furnaces, the ``appropriate community'' may 
also include those residing or doing business within the geographical 
locale of the land to be purchased.
    (2) Information concerning national defense and foreign policy. 
Information specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and which is in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
order.
    (3) Information exempted by other statutes and agency rules. 
Information specifically exempted from disclosure by any statute other 
than the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and 5 U.S.C. 552 which is 
applicable to the Internal Revenue Service, and any information obtained 
by the Internal Revenue Service solely and directly from another Federal 
agency subject to a nondisclosure

[[Page 82]]

rule of such agency. Deletion of information shall not be made solely 
because the same information was submitted to another Federal agency 
subject to a nondisclosure rule applicable only to such agency.
    (4) Trade secrets and privileged or confidential commercial or 
financial information--(i) Deletions to be made. Any--
    (A) Trade secrets, and
    (B) Commercial or financial information obtained from any person 
which, despite the fact that identifying details are deleted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, nonetheless remains privileged or 
confidential.
    (ii) Trade secret. For purposes of paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this 
section, a trade secret may consist of any formula, pattern, device or 
compilation of information that is used in one's business, and that 
gives one an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do 
not know or use it. It may be a formula for a chemical compound, a 
process of manufacturing, treating or preserving materials, a pattern 
for a machine or other device, or a list of customers. The subject of a 
trade secret must be secret, that is, it must not be of public knowledge 
or of a general knowledge in the trade or business. Novelty, in the 
patent law sense, is not required for a trade secret.
    (iii) Privileged or confidential. For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, information is privileged or confidential 
if from examination of the request and supporting documents relating to 
a written determination, and in consideration of the fact that 
identifying details are deleted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, it is determined that disclosure of such information would 
cause substantial harm to the competitive position of any person. For 
example, while determining whether disclosure of certain information 
would cause substantial harm to X's competitive position, the Internal 
Revenue Service becomes aware that his information has previously been 
disclosed to the public. In this situation, the Internal Revenue Service 
will not agree with X's argument that disclosure of the information 
would cause substantial harm to X's competitive position. An example of 
information previously disclosed to the public is financial information 
contained in the published annual reports of widely held public 
corporations.
    (5) Information within the ambit of personal privacy. Information 
the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion 
of personal privacy, despite the fact that identifying details are 
deleted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Personal privacy 
information encompasses embarrassing or sensitive information that a 
reasonable person would not reveal to the public under ordinary 
circumstances. Matters of personal privacy include, but are not limited 
to, details not yet public of a pending divorce, medical treatment for 
physical or mental disease or injury, adoption of a child, the amount of 
a gift, and political preferences. A clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy exists if from analysis of information submitted in 
support of the request for a written determination it is determined that 
the public interest purpose for requiring disclosure is outweighed by 
the potential harm attributable to such invasion of personal privacy.
    (6) Information concerning agency regulation of financial 
institutions. Information contained in or related to reports prepared 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the 
regulation or supervision of financial institutions concerning 
examination, operation or condition of a financial institution, 
disclosure of which would damage the standing of such financial 
institution.
    (7) Information concerning wells. Geological or geophysical 
information and data, including maps, concerning wells.
    (b) Manner of deletions. Whenever information, which is not to be 
disclosed pursuant to section 6110(c), is deleted from the text of a 
written determination or background file document, substitutions 
therefore shall be made to the extent feasible if necessary for an 
understanding of the legal analysis developed in such written 
determination or to make the disclosed text of a background file 
document comprehensible. Wherever any material is deleted, an indication 
of such deletion, and of any substitution therefor, shall be made in 
such manner as the Commissioner deems appropriate.

[[Page 83]]

    (c) Limitations on the making of deletions. Any portion of a written 
determination or background file document that has been deleted will be 
restored to the text thereof--
    (1) If pursuant to section 6110(d)(3) or (f)(4)(A) a court orders 
disclosure of such portion, or
    (2) If pursuant, to Sec. 301.6110-5(d)(1) an agreement is reached to 
disclose information.

Sec. 301.6110-4  Communications from third parties.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section a record will be made of any communication, whether written, by 
telephone, at a meeting, or otherwise, received by the Internal Revenue 
Service or Office of its Chief Counsel prior to the issuance of written 
determination from any person other than a person to whom the written 
determination pertains or the authorized representative of such person. 
This rule applies to any communication concerning such written 
determination, any communication concerning the request for such written 
determination, or any communication concerning other matters involving 
such written determination. A notation that such communication has been 
made shall be placed on such written determination when it is made open 
to public inspection or available for inspection upon written request 
pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-5. The notation to be placed on a written 
determination shall consist of the date on which the communication was 
received and the category of the person making such communication, for 
example, Congressional, Department of Commerce, Treasury, trade 
association, White House, educational institution. Any person may 
request the Internal Revenue Service to disclose the name of any person 
about whom a notation has been made pursuant to this paragraph.
    (b) Limitations. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not apply to communications received by the Internal Revenue 
Service from employee of the Internal Revenue Service or Office of its 
Chief Counsel, from the Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee on 
Internal Revenue Taxation, from the Department of Justice with respect 
to any pending civil or criminal case or investigation, or from another 
government agency in response to a request made by the Internal Revenue 
Service to such agency for assistance involving the expertise of such 
agency.
    (c) Action to obtain disclosure of identity of person to whom 
written determination pertains--(1) Creation of remedy. With respect to 
any written determination on which a notation has been placed pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section, any person may file a petition in the 
United States Tax Court or file a complaint in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring that 
the identity of any person to whom such written determination pertains 
be disclosed, but such petition or complaint must be filed within 36 
months of the date such written determination is made open or subject to 
inspection.
    (2) Necessary disclosure. Whenever an action is brought pursuant to 
section 6110(d)(3), the court may order that the identity of any person 
to whom the written determination pertains be disclosed. Such disclosure 
may be ordered if the court determines that there is evidence in the 
record from which it could reasonably be concluded that an impropriety 
occurred or undue influence was exercised with respect to such written 
determination by or on behalf of the person to whom the written 
determination pertains. The court may, pursuant to section 6110(d)(3), 
also order the disclosure of any material deleted pursuant to section 
6110(c) if such disclosure is in the public interest. The written 
determination or background file document with respect to which the 
disclosure was sought shall be revised to disclose the information which 
the court orders to be disclosed.
    (3) Required notice. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to 
section 6110(d)(3) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to 
any written determination, the Secretary shall send notice of the 
commencement of such proceeding to any person whose identity is subject 
to being disclosed and to the person about whom a third-party 
communication notation has been made pursuant to section 6110(d)(1). 
Such notice shall be sent, by registered

[[Page 84]]

or certified mail, to the last known address of the persons described in 
this paragraph (c)(3) within 15 days after notice of the petition or 
complaint filed pursuant to section 6110(d)(3) is served on the 
Secretary.
    (4) Intervention. Any person who is entitled to receive notice 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall have the right to 
intervene in any action brought pursuant to section 6110(d)(3). If 
appropriate such person shall be permitted to intervene anonymously.

Sec. 301.6110-5  Notice and time requirements; actions to restrain disclosure; actions to obtain additional disclosure.

    (a) Notice--(1) General rule. Before a written determination is made 
open to public inspection or subject to inspection upon written request, 
or before a background file document is subject to inspection upon 
written request, the person to whom the written determination pertains 
or background file document relates shall be notified by the 
Commissioner of intention to disclose such written determination or 
background file document. The notice with respect to a written 
determination, other than a written determination described in 
Sec. 301.6110-1(b) (2) or (3) shall be mailed when such written 
determination is issued. The notice with respect to any written 
determination relating to accounting or funding periods and methods, any 
technical advice memoranda involving civil fraud and criminal 
investigations, and jeopardy and termination assessments, and any 
background file document shall be mailed within a reasonable time after 
the receipt of the first written request for inspection thereof.
    (2) Contents of notice. The notice required by paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section shall--
    (i) Include a copy of the text of the written determination or 
background file document, which the Commissioner proposes to make open 
to public inspection or subject to inspection pursuant to a written 
request, on which is indicated (A) the material that the Commissioner 
proposes to delete pursuant to section 6110(c), (B) any substitutions 
proposed to be made therefor, and (C) any third-party communication 
notations required to be placed pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-4(a) on the 
face of the written determination.
    (ii) State that the written determination or background file 
document is to be open to public inspection or subject to inspection 
pursuant to a written request pursuant to section 6110.
    (iii) State that the recipient of the notice has the right to seek 
administrative remedies pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and 
to commence judicial proceedings pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) within 
indicated time periods, and
    (iv) Prominently indicate the date on which the notice is mailed.
    (b) Actions to restrain disclosure--(1) Administrative remedies. Any 
person to whom a written determination pertains or background file 
document relates, and any successor in interest, executor or authorized 
representative of such person may pursue the administrative remedies 
described in Sec. 601.105(b)(5) (iii)(i) and (vi)(f) and Sec. 601.201(e) 
(11) and (16) of this chapter. Any person who has a direct interest in 
maintaining the confidentiality of any written determination or 
background file document or portion thereof may pursue the 
administrative remedies described in Sec. 601.105(b)(5)(vi)(f) and 
Sec. 601.201(e)(16) of this chapter. No person about whom a third-party 
communication notation has been made pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-4(a) may 
pursue any administrative remedy for the purpose of restraining 
disclosure of the identity of such person where such identity appears 
with respect to the making of such third-party communication.
    (2) Judicial remedy. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, any person permitted to resort to administrative remedies 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section may, if such person 
proposes any deletion not made pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-3 by the 
Commissioner, file a petition in the United States Tax Court pursuant to 
section 6110(f)(3) for a determination with respect to such proposed 
deletion. If appropriate, such petition may be filed anonymously. Any 
petition filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) must be filed within 60 
days after the date on which

[[Page 85]]

the Commissioner mails the notice of intention to disclose required by 
section 6110(f)(1).
    (3) Limitations on right to bring judicial actions. No petition 
shall be filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) unless the administrative 
remedies provided by paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been 
exhausted. However, if the petitioner has responded within the 
prescribed time period to the notice pursuant to section 6110(f)(1) of 
intention to disclose, but has not received the final administrative 
conclusion of the Internal Revenue Service within 50 days after the date 
on which the Commissioner mails the notice of intention to disclose 
required by section 6110(f)(1), the petitioner may file a petition 
pursuant to section 6110(f)(3). No judicial action with respect to any 
written determination or background file document shall be commenced 
pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) by any person who has received a notice 
with respect to such written determination or background file document 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4) Required notice. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to 
section 6110(f)(3) with respect to any written determination or 
background file document, the Secretary shall send notice of the 
commencement of such proceeding to any person to whom such written 
determination pertains or to whom such background file document relates. 
No notice is required to be sent to persons who have filed the petition 
that commenced the proceeding pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) with 
respect to such written determination or background file document. The 
notice shall be sent, by registered or certified mail, to the last known 
address of the persons described in this paragraph (b)(4) within 15 days 
after notice of the petition filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) is 
served on the Secretary.
    (5) Intervention. Any person who is entitled to receive notice 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall have the right to 
intervene in any action brought pursuant to this section. If 
appropriate, such person shall be permitted to intervene anonymously.
    (c) Time at which open to public inspection--(1) General rule. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the 
text of any written determination or background file document open to 
public inspection or available for inspection upon written request 
pursuant to section 6110 shall be made open to or available for 
inspection no earlier than 75 days and no later than 90 days after the 
date on which the Commissioner mails the notice required by paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. However, if an action is brought pursuant to 
section 6110(f)(3) to restrain disclosure of any portion of such written 
determination or background file document the disputed portion of such 
written determination or background file document shall be made open to 
or available for inspection pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (2) Limitations--(i) Court order. The portion of the text of any 
written determination or background file document that was subject to an 
action pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) to restrain disclosure in which 
the court determined that such disclosure should not be restrained shall 
be made open to or available for inspection within 30 days of the date 
that the court order becomes final. However, in no event shall such 
portion of the text of such written determination or background file 
document be made open to or available for inspection earlier than 75 
days after the date on which the Commissioner mails the notice of 
intention to disclose required by section 6110(f)(1) and paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. Such 30-day period may be extended for such time 
as the court finds necessary to allow the Commissioner to comply with 
its decision. Any portion of a written determination or background file 
document which a court orders open to public inspection or subject to 
inspection upon written request pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) or 
disclosed pursuant to section 6110(d)(3) shall be made open or subject 
to inspection or disclosed within such time as the court provides.
    (ii) Postponement based on incomplete status of underlying 
transaction--(A) Initial period not to exceed 90 days. The time period 
set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section within which a written 
determination shall be made open to public inspection or available

[[Page 86]]

for inspection upon written request shall be extended, upon the written 
request of the person to whom such written determination pertains or the 
authorized representative of such person, until 15 days after the date 
on which the transaction set forth in the written determination is 
scheduled to be completed, but such day shall be no later than 180 days 
after the date on which the Commissioner mails the notice of intention 
to disclose.
    (B) Additional period. The time period determined pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section shall be further extended upon 
an additional written request, if the Commissioner determines from the 
information contained in such request that good cause exists to warrant 
such extension. This further extension shall be until 15 days after the 
date on which the transaction set forth in the written determination is 
expected to be completed, but such day shall be no later than 360 days 
after the date on which the Commissioner mails the notice of intention 
to disclose. The good cause required by this paragraph (B) exists if the 
person requesting the delay in inspection demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the Commissioner that it is likely that the lack of such 
extension will cause interference with consummation of the pending 
transaction.
    (C) Written request for extension. The written request for extension 
of the time when a written determination is to be made open to public 
inspection or available for inspection upon written request shall set 
forth the date on which it is expected that the underlying transaction 
will be completed, and, with respect to the additional extension 
described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, set forth the 
reason for requesting such extension. A request for extension of time 
may not be submitted until the notice of intention to disclose is mailed 
and must be received by the Internal Revenue Service office which issued 
such written determination no later than--
    (1) In the case of the initial extension, 60 days after the date on 
which the Commissioner mails the notice of intention to disclose, or
    (2) In the case of the additional extension, 15 days before the day 
on which, for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the 
transaction set forth in the written determination was expected to have 
been completed.
    (D) Notice and determination of actual completion. If an extension 
of time for inspection has been granted, and the transaction is 
completed prior to the day on which it was expected to have been 
completed, the Internal Revenue Service office which issued such written 
determination shall be so notified by the person who requested such 
extension. In such event, the written determination shall be made open 
to public inspection or available for inspection upon written request on 
the earlier of (1) 30 days after the day on which the Commissioner is 
notified that the transaction is completed, or (2) the day on which the 
written determination was scheduled to be made open to public inspection 
or available for inspection upon written request pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section. Similarly, if the Commissioner determines 
that the transaction was completed prior to the day on which it was 
expected to have been completed, even if the person requesting such 
extension has not so notified the Internal Revenue Service, the written 
determination shall be made open to public inspection or available for 
inspection upon written request on the earlier of (1) the day which is 
30 days after the Commissioner ascertains that the transaction is 
completed sooner than has been expected, or (2) the day on which the 
written determination was scheduled to be made open to public inspection 
or available for inspection upon written request pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (d) Actions to obtain additional disclosure--(1) Administrative 
remedies. Under section 6110(f)(4) any person may seek to obtain 
additional disclosure of information contained in any written 
determination or background file document that has been made open or 
subject to inspection. A request for such additional disclosure shall be 
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service office which issued such 
written determination, or to which the request for inspection of such 
background file document has been submitted pursuant to

[[Page 87]]

Sec. 301.6110-1(c)(4), and must contain the file number of the written 
determination or a description of the background file document 
(including the file number of the related written determination), the 
deleted information which in the opinion of such person should be open 
or subject to inspection, and the basis for such opinion. If the 
Internal Revenue Service determines that the request constitutes a 
request for disclosure of the name, address, or the identifying numbers 
described in Sec. 301.6110-3(a)(1)(i) of any person, it shall within a 
reasonable time notify the person requesting such disclosure that 
disclosure will not be made. If the Internal Revenue Service determines 
that the request or any portion thereof constitutes a request for 
disclosure of information other than the name, address, or the 
identifying numbers described in Sec. 301.6110-3(a)(1)(i) of any person, 
it shall send a notice that such additional disclosure has been 
requested to any person to whom the written determination pertains or 
background file document relates, and to all persons who are identified 
by name and address in the written determination or background file 
document. Notice that such persons have been contacted shall be sent to 
the person requesting the additional disclosure. The notice that 
additional disclosure has been requested shall state that the Internal 
Revenue Service has determined that additional disclosure of information 
other than the name, address, or the identifying numbers described in 
Sec. 301.6110-3(a)(1)(i) of any person has been requested, inform the 
recipient of the notice that the person seeking the additional 
disclosure has the right under section 6110(f)(4) to bring a judicial 
action to attempt to compel such disclosure, and request the recipient 
of the notice to reply within 20 days by submitting a statement of 
whether or not the recipient of the notice agrees to the requested 
disclosure or portion thereof. If all persons to whom a notice is sent 
pursuant to this paragraph (d)(1) of this section agree to disclose the 
requested information or any portion thereof, the person seeking such 
disclosure will be so informed; the written determination or background 
file document shall be accordingly revised to disclose the information 
with respect to which an agreement to disclose has been reached. If any 
of the persons to whom a notice is sent pursuant to this paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section do not agree to the additional disclosure or do 
not respond to such notice, the Internal Revenue Service shall within a 
reasonable time so notify the person requesting such disclosure, and 
deny the request for additional disclosure.
    (2) Judicial remedy. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, any person who seeks to obtain additional disclosure of 
information contained in any written determination or background file 
document may file a petition pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) in the 
United States Tax Court or a complaint in the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring that such 
information be made open or subject to inspection. Nothing in this 
paragraph shall prevent the Commissioner from disposing of written 
determinations and related background file documents pursuant to 
Sec. 301.6110-7(a).
    (3) Limitations on right to bring judicial action--(i) Exhaustion of 
administrative remedies. No petition or complaint shall be filed 
pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) unless the administrative remedies 
provided by paragraph (d)(1) of this section have been exhausted. 
However, if the Internal Revenue Service does not approve or deny the 
request for additional disclosure within 180 days after the request is 
submitted, the person making the request may file a petition pursuant to 
section 6110(f)(4).
    (ii) Actions to obtain identity. No petition or complaint shall be 
filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) to obtain disclosure of the 
identity of any person to whom a written determination on which a third-
party communication notation has been placed pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-
4(a) pertains. Such actions shall be brought pursuant to section 
6110(d)(3).
    (4) Required notice. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to 
section 6110(f)(4) with respect to any written determination or 
background file document, the Secretary shall send notice of the 
commencement of such proceeding to any person to whom the written

[[Page 88]]

determination pertains or background file document relates, and to all 
persons who are identified by name and address in the written 
determination or background file document. The notice shall be sent, by 
registered or certified mail, to the last known address of the persons 
described in this paragraph (d)(4) within 15 days after notice of the 
petition or complaint filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) is served on 
the Secretary.
    (5) Intervention. Any person who is entitled to receive notice 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall have the right to 
intervene in any action brought pursuant to this section. If 
appropriate, such person shall be permitted to intervene anonymously.

[[Page 89]]

(i) General rule. Before a written determination is made open to public 
inspection and before a particular written determination is subject to 
inspection in response to the first written request therefor, the 
Commissioner shall publish in the Federal Register a notice that the 
written determination is to be made open or subject to inspection. 
Notices with respect to written determinations, other than those 
described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, shall be published at 
the earliest practicable time after this regulation is adopted as a 
Treasury decision. Notices with respect to written determinations 
subject to inspection upon written request shall be published within a 
reasonable time after the receipt of the first written request for 
inspection thereof, but no sooner than the day as of which all other 
written determinations open to public inspection under this section have 
been made open to public inspection. Notices with respect to background 
file documents shall be sent in accordance with the rules in 
Sec. 301.6110-5(a) and will be mailed by the Internal Revenue Service to 
the most recent addresses of the persons to whom the background file 
document relates that are in the written determination file.
    (ii) Sequence of notices. Notices with respect to written 
determinations, other than general written determinations issued before 
July 5, 1967, shall be published in the following order. The first 
category is notices with respect to reference written determinations 
issued under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The second category is 
notices with respect to general written determinations issued after July 
4, 1967. The third category is notices with respect to reference written 
determinations issued under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or 
corresponding provisions of prior law. Within a category, the 
Commissioner may publish notices individually or for groups of written 
determinations arranged according to the jurisdictions of the ruling 
branches in the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (Technical) and the 
Assistant Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations), as the 
Commissioner may find reasonable. To the extent practicable, notices 
published individually shall be published in the reverse order of the 
issuance of the written determinations for which they are published, 
starting with the most recent written determination issued. To the 
extent practicable, each group shall consist of consecutively issued 
written determinations. Notices for groups shall be published, to the 
extent practicable, in the reverse order of the time period of issuance 
of the written determinations in each group, starting with the most 
recent time period.
    (iii) Contents of notice. The notice required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section shall:
    (A) Identify by subject matter description and dates of issuance the 
written determinations that the Commissioner proposes to make open or 
subject to inspection.
    (B) State that the written determinations will be made open or 
subject to inspection pursuant to section 6110(h),
    (C) State that the persons to whom the written determinations 
pertain have the right to seek administrative remedies under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section and to commence judicial proceedings under 
section 6110(h)(4) within indicated time periods,
    (D) State that there exist the possibilities that someone might 
request additional disclosure under section 6110(f)(4) and that someone 
might request inspection of a related background file document, and
    (E) State that any notice that must be mailed by the Internal 
Revenue Service will be sent to the most recent address of the person to 
whom the notice must be sent that is in the relevent written 
determination file.
    (2) Actions to restrain disclosure--(i) Information on written 
determinations described by notice. Any person may, within 15 days after 
the Commissioner publishes in the Federal Register a notice of intention 
to disclose a written determination under section 6110(h), request the 
Internal Revenue Service to provide certain information. This 
information includes whether any of the written determinations described 
by the notice is one that was issued to the person requesting this 
information. The Internal Revenue Service will also inform the person 
whether any of the written determinations described by

[[Page 90]]

the notice is one that was issued to a person with respect to whom the 
person requesting this information is a successor in interest executor 
or authorized representative. However, in order to do so, the Internal 
Revenue Service must be given the name and taxpayer identifying number 
of this other person and documentation of the relationship between that 
person and the person requesting the information. If the person 
requesting this information is a person to whom a written determination 
described by the notice pertains, or a successor in interest, executor, 
or authorized representative of that person, the Internal Revenue 
Service will also provide the person with a copy of the written 
determination on which is indicated the material that the Commissioner 
proposes to delete under section 6110(c) and any substitution proposed 
to be made therefor.
    (ii) Administrative remedies. Any person to whom a written 
determination described by the notice in the Federal Register pertains, 
and any successor in interest, executor or authorized representative of 
that person may pursue the administrative remedies described in this 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii). If after receiving the information described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the person pursuing these 
administrative remedies desires to protest the disclosure of certain 
information in the written determination, that person must within 35 
days after the notice is published submit a written statement 
identifying those deletions not made by the Internal Revenue Service 
which the person believes should have been made. The person pursuing 
these administrative remedies must also submit a copy of the version of 
the written determination proposed to be open or subject to inspection 
on which that person indicates, by the use of brackets, the deletions 
which the person believes should have been made. The Internal Revenue 
Service shall, within 20 days after receipt of the response by the 
person pursuing these administrative remedies, mail to that person its 
final administrative conclusion with respect to the deletions to be 
made.
    (iii) Judicial remedy. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of 
this section, any person permitted to resort to administrative remedies 
under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section may, if that person proposed 
any deletion not made under section 6110(c) by the Commissioner, file a 
petition in the United States Tax Court under section 6110(h)(4) for a 
determination with respect to the proposed deletion. If appropriate, the 
petition may be filed anonymously. Any petition filed under section 
6110(h)(4) must be filed within 75 days after the date on which the 
Commissioner publishes in the Federal Register the notice of intention 
to disclose required under section 6110(h)(4).
    (iv) Limitations on right to bring judicial actions. No petition 
shall be filed under section 6110(h)(4) unless the administrative 
remedies provided by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section have been 
exhausted. However, under two circumstances the petition may be filed 
even though the administrative remedies have not been exhausted. The 
first circumstance is if the petitioner requests the information 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section within 15 days after 
the notice of intention to disclose is published in the Federal 
Register, but does not receive it within 30 days after the notice is 
published. The other circumstance is if the petitioner submits the 
statement of deletions within 35 days after the notice is published, but 
does not receive the final administrative conclusion of the Internal 
Revenue Service within 65 days after the notice is published. No 
judicial action with respect to any written determination shall be 
commenced under section 6110(h)(4) by any person who has received a 
notice with respect to the written determination under paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (v) Required notice. If a proceeding is commenced under section 
6110(h)(4) with respect to any written determination, the Secretary 
shall send notice of the commencement of the proceeding to any person to 
whom the written determination pertains. No notice is required to be 
sent to persons who have filed the petition that commenced the 
proceeding under section 6110(h)(4) with respect to the written 
determination. The notice shall be sent, by registered

[[Page 91]]

or certified mail, to the last known address of the persons described in 
this paragraph (b)(2)(v) within 15 days after notice of the petition 
filed under section 6110(h)(4) is served on the Secretary.
    (vi) Intervention. Any person who is entitled to receive notice 
under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section has the right to intervene in 
any action brought under this paragraph (b)(2). If appropriate, this 
person shall be permitted to intervene anonymously.
    (vii) Background file documents. The following qualifications of the 
rules in Sec. 301.6110-5(b) apply with respect to the restraint of 
disclosure of background file documents related to written 
determinations to which this section applies. First, the administrative 
remedies described in Secs. 601.105 (b)(5)(iii)(i) and 601.201(e)(11) of 
this chapter do not apply. Second, the rule in 
Secs. 601.105(b)(5)(vi)(f) and 601.201(e)(16) that the Internal Revenue 
Service will not consider the deletion of material not proposed for 
deletion prior to the issuance of the written determination does not 
apply.
    (3) Time at which open to public inspection--(i) General rule. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, 
the text of any written determination open to public inspection or 
available for inspection upon written request under section 6110(h) 
shall be made open to or available for inspection no earlier than 90 
days and no later than 120 days after the date on which the Commissioner 
publishes in the Federal Register  the notice of intention to disclose 
required under section 6110(h)(4). However, if an action is brought 
under section 6110(h)(4) to restrain disclosure of any portion of a 
written determination, the disputed portion of that written 
determination shall be made open to or available for inspection under 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Limitation on account of court order. The portion of the text 
of any written determination that was subject to an action under section 
6110(h)(4) to restrain disclosure in which the court determined that the 
disclosure should not be restrained shall be made open to or available 
for inspection within 30 days of the date that the court order becomes 
final. However, in no event shall that portion of the text of that 
written determination be made open to or available for inspection 
earlier than 90 days after the date on which the Commissioner publishes 
in the Federal Register the notice of intention to disclose required by 
section 6110(h)(4) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This 30-day 
period may be extended for such time as the court finds necessary to 
allow the Commissioner to comply with its decision. Any portion of a 
written determination which a court orders open to public inspection or 
subject to inspection upon written request under section 6110(f)(4) 
shall be open or subject to inspection within such time as the court 
provides.
    (iii) Background file documents. The rules in Sec. 301.6110-
5(c)(2)(ii) do not apply with respect to the time at which background 
file documents related to written determinations to which this section 
applies are subject to inspection.

determines that such written determination no longer has any significant 
reference value. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the 
Commissioner shall not classify as a general written determination any 
written determination which is determined to be the basis for a 
published revenue ruling unless such revenue ruling is obsoleted, 
revoked, superseded or otherwise held to have no effect.
    (2) General written determinations. The Internal Revenue Service may 
dispose of general written determinations and any background file 
document relating to such written determination pursuant to its

background file document shall not occur earlier than 3 years after the 
date on which the related written determination is made open to public 
inspection or available for inspection upon written request.
    (b) Precedential status of written determinations open to public 
inspection. A written determination may not be used or cited as 
precedent, but the rule set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to 
change the precedential status, if any, of written determinations issued 
with respect to taxes imposed by subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954.
    (c) Civil remedies--(1) Liability for failure to make deletions or 
to conform to time limitations--(i) Creation of remedy. An exclusive 
remedy against the Commissioner shall exist in the Court of Claims for--
    (A) The person to whom the written determination pertains whenever 
the Commissioner fails to act in accordance with the time requirements 
of section 6110(g), and
    (B) The person to whom the written determination pertains and any 
person identified in such written determination whenever the 
Commissioner fails to make deletions required by section 6110(c) if as a 
consequence of such failure there is disclosed the identity of such 
person or other information with respect to such person that is required 
to be deleted pursuant to section 6110(c).
    (ii) Limitations. The remedy provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section for failure to make deletions shall be available only if--
    (A) The failure of the Commissioner to make the deletions required 
by section 6110(c) is intentional or willful,
    (B) The Commissioner fails to make any deletion required by section 
6110(c) which the Commissioner has agreed to make, or

    (iii) Damages. In any suit brought pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) 
of this section in which the court determines that an employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service intentionally or willfully failed to make a 
deletion required by section 6110(c), or intentionally or willfully 
failed to act in accordance with the time requirements of section 
6110(g), the United States shall be liable, to the person described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section who brought the action, in an amount 
equal to the sum of--
    (A) Actual damages sustained by such person but in no case shall 
such person be entitled to receive less than the sum of $1,000.
    (B) The costs of the action, and
    (C) Reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.
    (2) Liability for making additional disclosure of information. The 
Commissioner shall not be liable for making any additional disclosure 
ordered pursuant to an action described in Sec. 301.6110-5(d)(2) if the 
notice required by Sec. 301.6110-5(d)(4) is sent.
    (3) Obligation to defend action for additional disclosure. The 
Commissioner shall not be required to defend any action brought to 
obtain additional disclosure pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) if the 
notice required by Sec. 301.6110-5(d)(4) is sent.
    (4) Obligation to make deletions. The Commissioner shall be 
obligated to make only those deletions required by section 6110(c) which 
he has agreed to make, those which a court has ordered to be made 
pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-5(b)(2) and those the omission of which would 
be intentional or willful.
    (d) Fees--(1) General rule--(i) Copies. The Commissioner may

costs of furnishing copies of material open to public inspection or 
subject to inspection upon written request pursuant to section 6110.
    (ii) Preparation of information available upon request. The 
Commissioner may prescribe fees pursuant to Sec. 601.702(f) of this 
chapter for the costs of searching for and making deletions from any 
written determinations and background if documents that are subject to 
inspection only upon written request pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-1(b).

[[Page 93]]

    (2) Reduction or waiver of fees--(i) Public interest. The 
Commissioner shall reduce or waive the fees described in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section if the Commissioner determines that furnishing 
copies of, searching for, or making deletions from any written 
determination or background file document primarily benefits the general 
public, as described in Sec. 601.702(f)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter.
    (ii) Previous requests. The Commissioner may waive the fees 
described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for searching for any 
written determination or background file document if the search for such 
written determination or background file document was made pursuant to a 
previous request for inspection thereof. The Commissioner shall waive 
the fees described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for making 
deletions from any written determination or background file document if 
the making of such deletions from such written determination or 
background file document was made pursuant to a previous request for 
inspection thereof. Nothing in this (d)(2)(ii) shall prevent the 
Commissioner from prescribing fees for making additional deletions from 
such written determination or background file document pursuant to 
Sec. 301.6110-5(b).

                               In General

    Q-1. What is tax shelter registration?
    A-1. Tax shelter registration is a new provision of the Internal 
Revenue Code that affects organizers, sellers, investors, and certain 
other persons associated with investments that are considered tax 
shelters. The new provision imposes the following three requirements. 
First, a tax shelter must be registered by the tax shelter organizer. 
(See A-4 of this section for the definition of a tax shelter. See A-25 
through A-39 of this section for rules relating to tax shelter 
organizers. See A-26 of this section for rules regarding when the seller 
of an interest in a tax shelter is treated as the tax shelter 
organizer.) Registration is accomplished by filing a properly completed 
Form 8264 with the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue 
Service will assign a registration number to each tax shelter that is 
registered. Second, any person who sells or otherwise transfers an 
interest in a tax shelter must furnish the registration number of the 
tax shelter to the purchaser or transferee of the interest. (See A-51 
through A-54 of this section for the time and manner in which the number 
must be furnished.) Third, any person who claims a deduction, loss, 
credit, or other tax benefit or reports any income from the tax shelter 
must report the registration number of the tax shelter on any return on 
which the deduction, loss, credit, benefit, or income in included. (See 
A-55 through A-57 of this section for rules relating to the reporting of 
tax shelter registration numbers.)
    Q-2. Are penalties provided for failure to comply with the 
requirements of tax shelter registration?
    A-2. Yes. Separate penalties are provided for failure to satisfy any 
of the requirements set forth in A-1 of this section. See A-1 of 
Sec. 301.6707-1T for the penalty for failure to register a tax shelter 
and A-8 of Sec. 301.6707-1T for the penalty for filing false or 
incomplete information will respect to the registration of a tax 
shelter. See A-12 of Sec. 301.6707-1T for the penalty for failure to 
furnish the tax shelter registration number to purchasers or 
transferees. See A-13 of 301.6707-1T for the penalty for failure to 
report the tax shelter registration number on a tax return on which a 
deduction, loss, credit, income, or other tax benefit is included. In 
addition, criminal penalties may be imposed for willful noncompliance 
with

[[Page 95]]

the requirements of tax shelter registration. See, for example, section 
7203, relating to willful failure to supply information, and section 
7206, relating to fraudulent and false statements.
    Q-3. Does registration of a tax shelter with the Internal Revenue 
Service indicate that the Internal Revenue Service has reviewed, 
examined, or approved the tax shelter or the claimed tax benefits?
    A-3. No. Moreover, any representation to prospective investors that 
states that a tax shelter is registered with the Internal Revenue 
Service (or that registration is being sought) must include a legend 
stating that registration does not indicate that the Internal Revenue 
Service has reviewed, examined or approved the tax shelter or any of the 
claimed tax benefits. (See A-50 of this section for the form and content 
of the legend.)

                           Tax Shelter Defined

    Q-4. What investments are tax shelters that are required to be 
registered with the Internal Revenue Service?
    A-4. A tax shelter is any investment that meets the following two 
requirements:
    (I) The investment must be one with respect to which a person could 
reasonably infer, from the representations made or to be made in 
connection with any offer for sale of any interest in the investment, 
that the tax shelter ratio for any investor may be greater than 2 to 1 
as of the close of any of the first 5 years ending after the date on 
which the investment is offered for sale.
    (II) The investment must be (i) required to be registered under a 
federal or state law regulating securities, (ii) sold pursuant to an 
exemption from registration requiring the filing of a notice with a 
federal or state agency regulating the offering or sale of securities, 
or (iii) a substantial investment.
    An investment that satisfies these two requirements is considered a 
tax shelter for registration purposes regardless of whether it is 
marketed or customarily designated as a tax shelter. See A-5 of this 
section for the definition of tax shelter ratio. See A-17 and A-18 of 
this section for the definition of an investment required to be 
registered under a federal or state law regulating securities. See A-19 
and A-20 of this section for the definition of an investment sold 
pursuant to an exemption from registration requiring the filing of a 
notice. See A-21 of this section for the definition of a substantial 
investment.

                            Tax Shelter Ratio

    Q-5. What does the term ``tax shelter ratio'' mean?
    A-5. The term ``tax shelter ratio'' means, with respect to any year, 
the ratio that the aggregate amount of deductions and 200 percent of the 
credits that are or will be represented as potentially allowable to an 
investor under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code for all periods 
up to (and including) the close of such year, bears to the investment 
base for such investor as of the close of such year.

       Deductions and Credits Represented as Potentially Allowable

    Q-6. What do the terms ``amount of deductions'' and ``credits'' 
mean?
    A-6. The term ``amount of deductions'' means the amount of gross 
deductions and other similar tax benefits potentially allowable with 
respect to the investment. The gross deductions are not to be offset by 
any gross income to be derived or potentially derived from the 
investment. Thus, the term ``amount of deductions'' is not equivalent to 
the net loss, if any, attributable to the investment. The term 
``credits'' means the gross amount of credits potentially allowable with 
respect to the investment without regard to any possible tax liability 
resulting from the investment or any potential recapture of the credits.
    Q-7. What does the term ``year'' mean for purposes of determining 
the tax shelter ratio?
    A-7. The term ``year'' means the taxable year of a tax shelter, or 
if the tax shelter has no taxable year, the calendar year.
    Q-8. Under what circumstances is a deduction or credit considered to 
be represented as being potentially allowable to an investor?
    A-8. A deduction or credit is considered to be represented as being 
potentially allowable to an investor if any

[[Page 96]]

statement is made (or will be made) in connection with the offering for 
sale of an interest in an investment indicating that a tax deduction or 
credit is available or may be used to reduce federal income tax or 
federal taxable income. Representations of tax benefits may be oral or 
written and include those made at the time of the initial offering for 
sale of interests in the investment, such as advertisements, written 
offering materials, prospectuses, or tax opinions, and those that are 
expected to be made subsequent to the initial offering. Representations 
are not confined solely to statements regarding actual dollar amounts of 
tax benefits, but also include general representations that tax benefits 
are available with respect to an investment. Thus, for example, an 
advertisement stating that ``purchase of restaurant includes trade 
fixtures (5-year write-off and investment tax credit)'' constitutes an 
explicit representation of tax benefits.
    Q-9. If a deduction or credit is not explicitly represented as being 
potentially allowable to an investor may it be inferred as a represented 
tax benefit that is includible in the tax shelter ratio?
    A-9. Yes. Although some explicit representation concerning tax 
benefits is necessary before an investment may be considered a tax 
shelter, once an explicit representation is made (or will be made) 
regarding any tax benefit, all deductions or credits typically 
associated with the investment will be inferred to have been represented 
as potentially allowable. Thus, the tax shelter ratio will be determined 
with reference to those tax benefits that are explicitly represented as 
being potentially allowable as well as all other tax benefits that are 
typically associated with the investment. The amount of each deduction 
or credit that is includible in the tax shelter ratio, if not 
specifically represented as to amount, should be reasonably estimated 
based on representations of economic value or economic projections, if 
any, or on any other information available to the tax shelter organizer. 
Reasonable estimates of deductions or credits may take into account past 
experience with similar investments. Reasonable estimates must assume 
use of the most accelerated allowable basis for cost recovery 
deductions.
    As an example of the application of this A-9, assume that an 
advertisement explicitly states that a building is eligible for the 
investment tax credit for rehabilitation of a certified historic 
structure, but makes no mention of cost recovery deductions, 
amortization deductions for construction period interest and taxes, real 
estate taxes after construction, ongoing maintenance expenses, or other 
deductions or credits typically associated with a building. Reasonable 
estimates of all such deductions and credits must be included with the 
investment tax credit explicitly represented in determining the tax 
shelter ratio associated with any investor's acquisition of an interest 
in the building.
    Q-10. Does the fact that representations are made (or to be made) 
indicating that a deduction may be offset by income from the investment 
or that a deduction or credit may be subject to recapture or may be 
disallowed on audit affect the computation of the tax shelter ratio?
    A-10. No. Deductions and credits represented as being potentially 
allowable are taken into account in computing the tax shelter ratio 
regardless of whether any qualifying statements are made.
    Q-11. Is interest to be paid by an investor with respect to a debt 
obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of an interest in 
the tax shelter included in the aggregate amount of deductions?
    A-11. If a deduction for such interest is explicitly represented (or 
will be represented) as being potentially allowable, the interest is 
includible in the aggregate amount of the deductions. In addition, any 
interest to be paid with respect to a debt obligation the proceeds of 
which reduce the investment base (see A-14 of this section), regardless 
of whether a deduction for such interest is explicitly represented as 
being allowable, will be considered a deduction typically associated 
with the investment (see A-9 of this section). Accordingly, such 
interest will be considered to be represented as being potentially 
allowable and must be taken into account in computing the tax shelter

[[Page 97]]

ratio. If interest to be paid with respect to a debt obligation the 
proceeds of which do not reduce the investment base (see A-14 of this 
section) is not explicitly represented as being potentially allowable, 
however, such interest will not be considered typically associated with 
the investment and will not be taken into account in computing the tax 
shelter ratio.
    Q-12. If representations are made that part or all of an amount 
invested in a tax shelter will be deductible upon the occurrence of an 
unintended event, will the deduction be included in the aggregate amount 
of deductions?
    A-12. No. Thus, for example, if representations are made that a 
person's investment in a tax shelter may give rise to a loss deduction 
if the investment becomes worthless, the amount of the loss deduction 
will not be included in the aggregate amount of deductions and will not 
be taken into account in computing the tax shelter ratio. Similarly, if 
representations are made that the costs of acquiring oil and gas lease 
interests may be deductible if the lease is proved worthless by 
abandonment, the amount of any loss deduction will not be included in 
the aggregate amount of deductions.

                             Investment Base

    Q-13. What does the term ``investment base'' mean?
    A-13. The term ``investment base'' means, with respect to any year 
(as defined in A-7 of this section), means the cumulative amount of 
money and the adjusted basis of other property (reduced by any liability 
to which such other property is subject) that is unconditionally 
required to be contributed or paid directly to the tax shelter on or 
before the close of such year by an investor.
    Q-14. What amounts must be eliminated from the investment base?
    A-14. The investment base must be reduced by the following amounts:
    (1) Any amount borrowed by the investor, even if borrowed on a 
recourse basis, from any person who participated in the organization, 
sale, or management of the investment or who has an interest (other than 
an interest as a creditor) in the investment (``a participating 
person'') or from any person who is related (as defined in section 168 
(e)(4)) to a participating person, unless the amount is unconditionally 
required to be repaid by the investor before the close of the year for 
which the determination is being made. An amount will be considered 
unconditionally required to be repaid by the investor only if any 
offering material in which the borrowed amount is described and any 
agreement to be entered into between a participating (or related) person 
and the investor provide that the amount must be repaid (without 
exception) by the end of the year for which the determination is being 
made. An amount that is to be repaid only from earnings of the 
investment is not an amount that is unconditionally required to be 
repaid and is thus excluded from the investment base. In addition, an 
amount is not unconditionally required to be repaid if the amount will 
be (or is expected to be) reloaned to the investor during the 5-year 
period ending after the date the investment is offered for sale.
    (2) Any amount borrowed by the investor, even if borrowed on a 
recourse basis, from a person, if the loan is arranged by a 
participating (or related) person, unless the amount is unconditionally 
required to be repaid by the investor before the close of the year for 
which the determination is being made. Any borrowing that is represented 
(orally or in writing) as being available from a specific source will be 
treated as arranged by a participating (or related) person, if the 
participating (or related) person provides a list of investors, or 
information relating to the investment, to the lender or otherwise 
informs the lender about the investment. However, in the case of an 
amount borrowed on a recourse basis, the mere fact that a lender who is 
actively and regularly engaged in the business of lending money obtained 
information relating to the investment, from a participating (or 
related) person, solely in response to a lender's request made in 
connection with such borrowing or a prior loan to the investment, a 
participating (or related) person, or an investor, will not, by itself, 
result in a determination that the loans are arranged by a participating 
(or related) person. Financing may be

[[Page 98]]

treated as arranged by a participating (or related) person regardless of 
whether a commitment to provide the financing is made by the lender to 
the participating or related person.
    For example, assume that a tax shelter organizer represents that the 
purchase of an interest in a tax shelter may be financed with the 
proceeds of a revolving loan, and the tax shelter organizer provides 
investors with the names of several banks or other lending institutions 
to which the tax shelter organizer has provided information about the 
investment. Assume further that the information was not provided in 
response to requests from such lending institutions made in connection 
with prior loans. The proceeds of the revolving loan will be excluded 
from the investment base because the loan is not unconditionally 
required to be repaid and it is treated as having been arranged by the 
tax shelter organizer.
    (3) Any amount borrowed, directly or indirectly, from a lender 
located outside the United States (``foreign-connected financing''), of 
which a participating (or related) person knows or has reason to know.
    (4) Any amounts to be held for the benefit of investors in cash, 
cash equivalents, or marketable securities. An amount is to be held in 
cash equivalents if the amount is to be held in a checking account, 
savings account, mutual fund, certificate of deposit, book entry 
government obligation, or any other similar account or arrangement. 
Marketable securities are any securities that are part of an issue any 
portion of which is traded on an established securities market and any 
securities that are regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a 
market.
    (5) Any distributions (whether of cash or property) that will be 
made without regard to the income of the tax shelter, but only to the 
extent such distributions exceed the amount to be held as of the close 
of the year in cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities.

                    Tax Shelter Ratio--Miscellaneous

    Q-15. Does an investment satisfy the requirement in A-4 (I) of this 
section (``the tax shelter ratio requirement'') if it may be inferred 
from the representations made or to be made to investors that the tax 
shelter ratio for some, but not all, of the investors may be greater 
than 2 to 1 as of the close of any one of the first five years?
    A-15. Yes. If the tax shelter ratio for any one investor may be 
greater that 2 to 1, the investment satisfies the the tax shelter ratio 
requirement and is a tax shelter if it also meets the requirement in A-
4(II) of this section. Moreover, an investment will satisfy the tax 
shelter ratio requirement even if the tax shelte ratio for a single 
investor exceeds 2 to 1 as of the close of only one of the first five 
years.
    For purposes of computing the tax shelter ratio for a year, all 
persons with interests in the investment are considered investors, 
except that general partners in a limited partnership will not be 
treated as investors in the partnership if the general partners' 
aggregate interest in each item of partnership income, gain, loss, 
deduction, and credit for such year is not expected to exceed 2 percent. 
In determining the general partners' interest in such items, limited 
partnership interests owned by general partners shall not be taken into 
account. For purposes other than the computation of the tax shelter 
ratio, however, all general partners will be treated as investors. Thus, 
for example, a general partner with a 1 percent interest in a limited 
partnership will be treated as an investor for the purpose of 
determining whether the partnership is a substantial investment.
    Q-16. If a person could reasonably infer from the representations 
made or to be made about an investment that the tax shelter ratio for 
the investment may be greater than 2 to 1 under one arrangement for 
financing the purchase of an interest by an investor, but would be 2 to 
1 or less under an alternative financing arrangement, does the 
investment satisfy the tax shelter ratio requirement of A-4 (I) of this 
section.
    A-16. Yes. An investment satisfies the tax shelter ratio requirement 
of A-4 (I) of this section if a person could reasonably infer from the 
representations made or to be made that the tax shelter ratio for any 
person may be greater than 2 to 1 as of the close of any one of the 
first five years. The tax

[[Page 99]]

shelter ratio requirement is met if the tax shelter ratio may exceed 2 
to 1 under any type of financing arrangement that is or will be 
represented as being available to investors.

              Investments Subject to Securities Regulation

    Q-17. What is an investment that is required to be registered under 
a federal law regulating securities?
    A-17. An investment required to be registered under a federal law 
regulating securities is any public offering of an investment that is 
required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, or any other federal law regulating 
securities. An investment is required to be registered under the 1933 
Act, the Investment Company Act, or any other federal law regulating 
securities, if failure to register the investment would result in a 
violations of the applicable federal law, whether or not the investment 
has in fact been registered and, if proper notice has not been filed, 
whether or not the investment could have been sold pursuant to an 
exemption listed in A-19 of this section if such notice had been filed.
    Q-18. What is an investment required to be registered under a state 
law regulating securities?
    A-18. An investment required to be registered under a state law 
regulating securities is any investment required to be registered under 
a blue sky law or other similar state statute regulating securities. The 
term ``state'' includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 
possessions of the United States.
    Q-19. What is an investment sold pursuant to an exemption from 
registration requiring the filing of a notice with a federal agency 
regulating the offering or sale of securities?
    A-19. An investment sold pursuant to an exemption from registration 
requiring the filing of a notice with such a federal agency is any 
investment that is sold pursuant to an exemption from registration 
requiring the filing or submission of a notice or other document with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal agency 
regulating the offering or sale of securities, including the following 
exemptions (and applicable filing):
    (1) Regulation A, as promulgated under section (3)(b) of the 1933 
Act (Form 1(A)),
    (2) Regulation B, as promulgated under section 3(b) of the 1933 Act 
(Schedules A through F),
    (3) Regulation D, as promulgated under sections (3)(b) and 4(2) of 
the 1933 Act (Form D), and
    (4) Any other statutory or regulatory exemption from registration 
requiring the filing or submission of a notice or other document.
    Q-20. What is an investment sold pursuant to an exemption from 
registration requiring the filing of a notice with a state agency 
regulating the offering or sale of securities?
    A-20. An investment sold pursuant to an exemption from registration 
requiring the filing of a notice with such a state agency is any 
investment sold pursuant to an exemption under a blue sky law or other 
similar state statutory or regulatory scheme that requires the filing or 
submission of a notice or other document with such a state agency. See 
A-18 of this section for the definition of state.

                         Substantial Investment

    Q-21. What is a substantial investment?
    A-21. An investment is a substantial investment if the aggregate 
amount that may be offered for sale to all investors exceeds $250,000 
and 5 or more investors are expected. The aggregate amount offered for 
sale is the aggregate amount to be received from the sale of interests 
in the investment and includes all cash, the fair market value of all 
property contributed, and the principal amount of all indebtedness 
received in exchange for interests in the investment, regardless of 
whether the proceeds of the indebtedness are included in the investment 
base under A-14 of this section. For purposes of determining whether 5 
or more investors are expected in an investment involving real property 
(and related personal property) that is used as a farm (as defined in 
section 2032A(e)(4)) for farming purposes (as defined in section 
2032A(e)(5)), interests in the investment expected to be held by a 
husband and wife, their children and parents, and the spouses of their 
children (or any of

[[Page 100]]

them) will be treated as if the interests were to be held by one 
investor. Thus, for example, interests in a farm that are offered to two 
brothers and their wives would be treated as interests offered to one 
investor. Such an investment could be a substantial investment only if 
four or more persons who were not members of the family were expected to 
be investors in the farm.
    Q-22. Will an investment be considered a substantial investment if 
the investment involves a number of parts each including fewer than 5 
investors or an aggregate amount of $250,000 or less?
    A-22. Yes, under the circumstances described in this A-22. For 
purposes of determining whether investments are parts of a substantial 
investment, similar investments offered by the same person or related 
persons (as defined in section 168(e)(4)) are aggregated together. 
Investments are considered similar if they involve similar principal 
business assets and similar plans or arrangements. Investments that 
include no business assets will be considered similar if they involve 
similar plans or arrangements.
    Similar investments are aggregated solely for the purpose of 
determining whether investments involving fewer than 5 investors or an 
aggregate amount of $250,000 or less are substantial investments. For 
this purpose, similar investments are aggregated even though some, but 
not all, of the investments are (i) required to be registered under a 
Federal or State law regulating securities or are sold pursuant to an 
exemption from securities registration requiring the filing of a notice 
with a Federal or State agency regulating the offering or sale of 
securities (i.e., required to be registered as tax shelters whether or 
not a substantial investment) or (ii) substantial investments without 
regard to aggregation.
    Assume, for example, that a person develops similar arrangements 
involving 8 different partnerships, each investing in a separate but 
similar asset (such as a separate master recording or separate piece of 
similar real estate), each with a different general partner and each 
with 3 different limited partners. Assume further that the arrangements 
of all the partnerships are similar. These partnerships involving 
similar arrangements and similar assets would be aggregated together. 
Thus, if each partner is expected to invest $11,000, there will be 32 
investors (1 general partner plus 3 limited partners times 8 
partnerships) and an aggregate investment of $352,000 (32 partners times 
$11,000). Accordingly, each partnership will constitute part of a 
substantial investment. If representations are made that $1,000 in tax 
credits and $3,000 in deductions are available to each limited partner 
in the first year and $10,000 of the cash invested was expected to be 
the proceeds of a loan arranged by the organizer, the tax shelter ratio 
as of the close of the first year (assuming there are no deductions or 
credits typically associated with such investment, as described in A-9 
of this section) would be 5 to 1 ($5,000 in total tax benefits and 
$1,000 investment base). Accordingly, the organizer would be required to 
register the partnerships with the Internal Revenue Service.
    Q-23. If an investment involving fewer than 5 investors or an 
aggregate amount of $250,000 or less is offered for sale and, at the 
time of the offering, it is not known (and there is no reason to know) 
that subsequent similar investments will be offered by the person who 
made the first offering (or a related person), will subsequent similar 
investments offered by that person (or a related person) be aggregated 
with the first investment for purposes of determining whether the 
investments constitute a substantial investment?
    A-23. No. However, a tax shelter organizer will be presumed to have 
known of any similar investments (as defined in A-22 of this section) 
offered during the 12 months following the first offering of an 
investment.

                Exceptions From Tax Shelter Registration

    Q-24. Are there any investments that will not be subject to tax 
shelter registration even if they satisfy the requirements of a tax 
shelter (as defined in A-4 of this section)?
    A-24. Yes. The following investments are not subject to tax shelter 
registration:

[[Page 101]]

    (1) Sales of residences primarily to persons who are expected to use 
the residences as their principal place of residence,
    (2) Sales or leases or tangible personal property (other than master 
sound recordings, motion picture or television films, videotapes, 
lithograph plates, or other property relating to a literary, musical, or 
artistic composition) by the manufacturer (or a member of an affiliated 
group, within the meaning of section 1502, including the manufacturer) 
of the property primarily to persons who are expected to use the 
property in their principal active trade or business (see, however, A-32 
and A-46 of this section for the additional rules applicable to a 
purchaser of property described in this A-24 who organizes an investment 
involving the property),
    (3) Any other investment as specified by the Secretary in a rule-
related notice published in the Federal Register.
    Q-24A. Under what other circumstances are particular sales or leases 
of tangible personal property to certain persons or the performance of 
particular services for certain persons exempt from tax shelter 
registration?
    A-24A. A person who, in the ordinary course of a trade or business, 
sells or leases tangible personal property (other than collectibles (as 
defined in section 408(m)(2)), master sound recordings, motion picture 
or television films, videotapes, lithograph plates, or other property 
that includes or relates to a literary, musical or artistic composition) 
to a purchaser or lessee who is reasonably expected to use the property 
either for a personal use or in the purchaser's or lessee's principal 
active trade or business is not required for any purpose to treat such a 
purchaser or lessee as an investor in a tax shelter. Property may be 
reasonably expected to be used by a purchaser or lessee for personal use 
only if sold or leased to the purchaser or lessee in a quantity that is 
customary for such use. Similarly, a person who performs services for 
another person in connection with the principal active trade or business 
of the recipient of the services or for the recipient's personal use is 
not required to treat the recipient as an investor in a tax shelter. 
Persons who are not reasonably expected to use property or services 
either in their principal active trade or business or for personal use 
must be treated as tax shelter investors in the event the sales, leases, 
or performance of services otherwise constitute a tax shelter.
    Assume, for example, that an organizer forms Z corporation to feed 
cattle and to provide services in connection with the cattle feeding 
operations. Z will agree to serve customers with a minimum of 200 head 
of cattle. The fee for the services is $20 per head. Feed for cattle 
will cost $280 per head. Z represents that the service fee and the cost 
of the feed may be financed by $5,000 of cash and $55,000 of proceeds of 
a revolving recourse note that Z has arranged be available. Z provides 
its services to 100 customers. Ninety-five of the customers are persons 
whose principal active trade or business is reasonably expected to be 
farming (as defined in section 464(e)(1)). Five of the customers are not 
reasonably expected to engage in farming as their principal active trade 
or business. Although all the individual investments involve similar 
principal business assets and similar plans or arrangements, only the 5 
customers who are not reasonably expected to be in the principal active 
trade or business of farming will be treated as investors in a tax 
shelter and aggregated to determine whether a substantial investment 
exists. Thus, there will be 5 investors and an aggregate investment of 
$300,000. If representations are made that the service fee and the cost 
of the feed are tax deductible, the tax shelter ratio (assuming there 
are no deductions or credits typically associated with such an 
investment, as described in A-9 of this section) would be 12 to 1 
($60,000 in total tax benefits and $5,000 investment base) and the 
organizer would be required to register the five aggregated feeding 
arrangements as a tax shelter. The registration number of the tax 
shelter must be provided to the five customers treated as investors in 
the tax shelter, but would not be required to be furnished to the 
customers whose principal active trade or business is reasonably 
expected to be farming.

               Persons Required To Register a Tax Shelter

    Q-25. Who has the legal obligation to register a tax shelter?
    A-25. A tax shelter organizer is obligated to register the tax 
shelter.
    Q-26. What is the definition of tax shelter organizer?
    A-26. Several categories of persons may be tax shelter organizers. 
In general, the term tax shelter organizer means a person principally 
responsible for organizing a tax shelter. If a person principally 
responsible for organizing a tax shelter has not registered the tax 
shelter by the day on which interests in the shelter are first offered 
for sale, any other person who participated in the organization of the 
tax shelter will be treated as a tax shelter organizer. If neither a 
person principally responsible for organizing the tax shelter nor any 
other person who participated in the organization of a tax shelter has 
registered the tax shelter by the day on which interests in the tax 
shelter are first offered for sale, then any person who participates in 
the management of the tax shelter at a time when the tax shelter is not 
registered will be treated as a tax shelter organizer. Finally, if a 
person participates in the sale of a tax shelter at a time when the 
person knows or has reason to know that a tax shelter has not been 
registered, that person will be treated as a tax shelter organizer. See 
A-38 of this section for rules relating to the execution of an agreement 
among persons who may be treated as tax shelter organizers to designate 
one person to register a tax shelter.
    Q-27. Who is a person principally responsible for organizing a tax 
shelter?
    A-27. A person principally responsible for organizing a tax shelter 
(``principal organizer'') is any person who discovers, creates, 
investigates, or initiates the investment, devises the business or 
financial plans for the investment, or carries out those plans through 
negotiations or transactions with others.
    Q-28. What constitutes participation in the organization of a tax 
shelter?
    A-28. Participation in the organization of a tax shelter includes 
the performance of any act (directly or through an agent) related to the 
establishment of the tax shelter, including the following:
    (1) Preparation of any document establishing the tax shelter (for 
example, articles of incorporation, a trust instrument, or a partnership 
agreement);
    (2) Preparation of any document in connection with the registration 
(or exemption from registration) of the tax shelter with any federal, 
state, or local government body;
    (3) Preparation of a prospectus, offering memorandum, financial 
statement, or other statement describing the tax shelter;
    (4) Preparation of a tax or other legal opinion relating to the tax 
shelter;
    (5) Preparation of an appraisal relating to the tax shelter;
    (6) Negotiation or other participation on behalf of the tax shelter 
in the purchase of any property relating to the tax shelter.
    Q-29. What constitutes participation in the management of a tax 
shelter?
    A-29. Participation in the management of a tax shelter includes 
managing the assets of the tax shelter, directing the business activity 
of the tax shelter, or, depending on the form of the tax shelter, acting 
as a general partner who actively participates in the management of a 
partnership, a trustee of a trust, a director or an officer of a 
corporation (including a corporate general partner of a partnership), or 
performing activities similar to those performed by such a general 
partner, a trustee, a director, or an officer.
    Q-30. Will the performance of any act described in A-27 through A-29 
of this section constitute participation in the organization or 
management of a tax shelter if the person performing the act is 
unrelated to the tax shelter (or any principal organizer of the tax 
shelter) and does not participate in the entrepreneurial risks or 
benefits of the tax shelter?
    A-30. No. The performance of an act desbribed in A-27 through A-29 
of this section will not constitute participation in the organization or 
management of a tax shelter unless the person performing the act is 
unrelated to the tax shelter (or any principal organizer of the tax 
shelter) or the person participates in the entrepreneurial risks

[[Page 103]]

or benefits of the tax shelter. A person will be considered related to a 
tax shelter if the person is related to the tax shelter or a principal 
organizer of the tax shelter within the meaning of section 168(e)(4) or 
is employed by the tax shelter or a principal organizer of the tax 
shelter or has an interest (other than an interest as a creditor) in the 
tax shelter. A person will be considered a participant in the 
entrepreneurial risks or benefits of a tax shelter if the person's 
compensation for performing an act described in A-27 through A-29 of 
this section is contingent on any matter relating to the tax shelter 
(e.g., the compensation is based in whole or in part upon (i) whether 
interests in the tax shelter are actually sold or (ii) the number or 
value of the units in the tax shelter that are sold), or if the person 
will receive an interest in the tax shelter as part or all of the 
person's compensation.
    For example, assume that A forms Z partnership, a tax shelter for 
which registration is required. Z hires the X law firm, none of the 
partners of which is related to the tax shelter, to prepare the 
documents necessary to register the offering of Z securities with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. X charges $100 an hour for its 
services in connection with the preparation of the necessary documents, 
and payment of the fee is not contingent. X will not be treated as a 
participant in the organization of the tax shelter. If, however, X were 
to charge a fee equal to 1 percent of the value of the units in the tax 
shelter that are sold, X would be considered a participant in the 
organization of the shelter.
    As another example, assume that individual C is an attorney employed 
by W corporation, the corporate general partner and principal organizer 
of Z, and that C prepares the documents necessary to register the tax 
shelter with the Securities and Exchange Commission. C will be treated 
as having participated in the organization of the tax shelter regardless 
of the way in which C's compensation is structured, because C, as an 
employee, is related to the principal organizer of the tax shelter.
    Q-31. What constitutes participation in the sale of a tax shelter?
    A-31. Participation in the sale of a tax shelter includes any 
marketing activities (directly or through an agent) with respect to an 
investment, including the following:
    (1) Direct contact with a prospective purchaser of an interest, or 
with a representative or agent of a prospective purchaser, but only if 
the contract relates to the possible purchase of an interest in the tax 
shelter;
    (2) Solicitation of investors using the mail, telephone, or other 
means, or by placing an advertisement for the tax shelter in a 
newspaper, magazine, or other publication or medium;
    (3) Instructing or advising salespersons regarding the tax shelter 
or sales presentations.
    Q-32. May persons be treated as tax shelter organizers if such 
persons do not make any representations of tax benefits to investors?
    A-32. Yes. If a person described in A-26 of this section knows or 
has reason to know that representations of tax benefits have been made, 
that person may be treated as a tax shelter organizer. For example, a 
participant in the sale of a tax shelter may know or have reason to know 
that representations of tax benefits have been made by the principal 
organizer or others who participate in the organization of the tax 
shelter. In addition, a person who acquires property from a manufacturer 
in a transaction exempt from tax shelter registration under A-24 of this 
section and who organizes an investment involving the property may know 
or have reason to know of any representation of tax benefits made by the 
manufacturer.
    Q-33. If a person performs support services such as typing, 
photocopying, or printing for a tax shelter (or a tax shelter organizer) 
or performs other ministerial functions for the tax shelter (or a tax 
shelter organizer), may the person be considered to have participated in 
the organization, management, or sale of the tax shelter?
    A-33. No. Merely performing support services or ministerial 
functions will not be considered participation in the organization, 
management, or sale of a tax shelter.

[[Page 104]]

    Circumstances Under Which Tax Shelter Organizers Are Required To 
                         Register a Tax Shelter

    Q-34. When is a principal organizer or a person who participates in 
the organization of a tax shelter required to register a tax shelter?
    A-34. A principal organizer or a person who participates in the 
organization of a tax shelter (i.e., a person who could be treated as a 
tax shelter organizer within the meaning of A-26 of this section) is 
required to register the tax shelter by the day on which the first 
offering for sale of interests in the tax shelter occurs, unless the 
person has signed a designation agreement pursuant to A-38 of this 
section. If a group of persons who could be treated as tax shelter 
organizers has signed a designation agreement pursuant to A-38 of this 
section, the designated organizer is required to register the tax 
shelter by the day on which the first offering for sale of interests in 
the tax shelter occurs. See A-39 of this section for additional rules 
applicable to tax shelter organizers (other than a designated organizer) 
who have signed a designation agreement.
    Q-35. When is a person who participates in the management of a tax 
shelter (``manager'') required to register a tax shelter?
    A-35. A manager who has not signed a designation agreement pursuant 
to A-38 of this section must register the tax shelter if the manager 
participates in the management of the tax shelter on or after the first 
offering for sale of interests in the tax shelter at a time when the tax 
shelter has not been properly registered (i.e., the manager is treated 
as a tax shelter organizer within the meaning of A-26 of this section). 
Such a manager must register the tax shelter by the day on which the 
first offering for sale of interests in the tax shelter occurs, or by 
the day on which the manager's participation in the management of the 
tax shelter commences, whichever is later. See A-39 of this section for 
rules applicable to a manager who has signed a designation agreement.
    Q-36. When is a person who participates in the sale of a tax shelter 
(``seller'') required to register the tax shelter?
    A-36. A seller who has not signed a designation agreement pursuant 
to A-38 of this section must register the tax shelter if the seller 
participates in the sale of the tax shelter at a time when the seller 
knows or has reason to know that the tax shelter has not been properly 
registered (i.e., the seller is treated as a tax shelter organizer 
within the meaning of A-26 of this section). A seller who has not signed 
a designation agreement will be deemed to have reason to know that the 
tax shelter has not been properly registered if the seller does not 
receive a copy of the Internal Revenue Service tax shelter registration 
notice containing the registration number within the 30-day period after 
the seller first offers interests in the tax shelter for sale. A seller 
must register the tax shelter as soon as practicable after the seller 
first knows or has reason to know that the tax shelter has not been 
properly registered. See A-39 of this section for rules applicable to a 
seller who has signed a designation agreement.
    Q-37. When is a person who acts in more than one capacity with 
respect to a tax shelter required to register the shelter?
    A-37. A person who acts in more than one capacity with respect to a 
tax shelter (i.e., as two or more of the following: principal organizer, 
participant in the organization, manager, or seller) must register the 
tax shelter by the earliest day on which a tax shelter organizer acting 
in any of the person's several capacities would be required to register 
the tax shelter.
    Q-38. May a group of persons who could be treated as tax shelter 
organizers under A-26 of this section designate one person to register 
the tax shelter?
    A-38. Yes. A group of persons who could be treated as tax shelter 
organizers under A-26 of this section may enter into a written agreement 
designating one person as the tax shelter organizer responsible for 
registering the tax shelter (``designated organizer''). The designated 
organizer should ordinarily be a person principally responsible for 
organizing the tax shelter, but may be any person who participates in 
the organization of the

[[Page 105]]

tax shelter. Although persons who participate only in the sale or 
management of a tax shelter may sign a designation agreement, they may 
not be the designated organizer. In addition, the designated organizer 
may not be a person who is a resident in a country other than the United 
States. Any person who signs a designation agreement, other than the 
designated organizer, will not be liable for failing to register the tax 
shelter and will not be subject to a penalty, even if the designated 
organizer fails to register the tax shelter, unless the person fails to 
register the tax shelter when such registration is required under A-39 
of this section. See A-7 of Sec. 301.6707-1T for additional rules 
relating to the reasonable cause exception applicable to persons who 
sign a designation agreement.
    Q-39. Is a tax shelter organizer who has signed a designation 
agreement and who is not the designated organizer required to register 
the tax shelter under any circumstances?
    A-39. Yes. If a tax shelter organizer who has signed a designation 
agreement pursuant to A-38 of this section knows or has reason to know 
on or after the day on which the first offering for sale of interests in 
a tax shelter occurs that the designated organizer failed to register 
the tax shelter, such tax shelter organizer must register the tax 
shelter as soon as practicable after he first knows or has reason to 
know of the failure. A tax shelter organizer who has signed a 
designation agreement is deemed to have reason to know that the 
designated organizer has failed to register the tax shelter if the tax 
shelter organizer does not receive a copy of the Internal Revenue 
Service registration notice containing the registration number from the 
designated organizer within the 60-day period after the day on which the 
first offering for sale of interests in the tax shelter occurs (or the 
person signs the designation agreement, if later). See A-41 of this 
section for the requirement that the designated organizer provide a copy 
of the registration notice and number to persons who have signed the 
designation agreement.

                       Registration--General Rules

    Q-40. By what date must a tax shelter be registered?
    A-40. A tax shelter must be registered not later than the day on 
which the first offering for sale of an interest in the tax shelter 
occurs.
    Q-41. Is a tax shelter organizer (including a designated organizer) 
who registers a tax shelter responsible for performing any act with 
respect to tax shelter registration other than registering the tax 
shelter?
    A-41. Yes. A tax shelter organizer (including a designated 
organizer) who registers a tax shelter must provide a copy of the 
Internal Revenue Service registration notice containing the registration 
number within 7 days after the notice is received from the Internal 
Revenue Service to the principal organizer (if a different person) and 
to any persons who the tax shelter organizer knows or has reason to know 
are participating in the sale of interests in the tax shelter (if such 
persons begin to participate after the registration number is received, 
they must be provided the notice within 7 days after they commence their 
participation). In addition, a designated organizer must provide a copy 
of the notice within 7 days after it is received to all persons who have 
signed the designation agreement.
    Q-42. What is the sale of an interest in a tax shelter?
    A-42. The sale of an interest in a tax shelter includes the sale of 
property, or any interest in property, the entry into a leasing 
arrangement, a consulting, management or other agreement for the 
performance of services, or the sale or entry into any other plan, 
investment, or arrangement.
    Q-43. What does the term ``offering for sale'' mean?
    A-43. The term ``offering for sale'' means making any 
representation, whether oral or written, relating to participation in a 
tax shelter as an investor. The term includes any advertisement relating 
to the tax shelter and any mail, telephonic, or other contact with 
prospective investors. A representation relating to participation in a 
tax shelter will be considered an offering for sale of an interest in 
the tax shelter even though there is included

[[Page 106]]

in the representation an explicit statement that the representation does 
not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy an 
interest in the tax shelter. In determining whether an offering for sale 
of an interest has occurred, federal and state laws regulating 
securities are not controlling.
    Q-44. After a tax shelter has been registered, must it be registered 
again each year that it continues to be offered for sale?
    A-44. No. Registration is effective for the year in which first 
accomplished and all subsequent years.
    Q-45. If the facts relating to a tax shelter change after the tax 
shelter has been registered, must the tax shelter be registered again or 
must an amended application for registration be filed by the tax shelter 
organizer?
    A-45. No. The tax shelter organizer, however, is permitted to file 
an amended application if a material change in facts occurs after the 
initial registration. A material change in facts is--
    (1) A change in the identifying information relating to the tax 
shelter or tax shelter organizer,
    (2) The acquisition or construction of a principal asset not 
reported on the initial application for registration,
    (3) A change in the method of financing a minimum investment unit, 
or
    (4) A change in the principal business activity.
    In addition, a change in any tax shelter ratio reported on the 
initial application for registration that increases or decreases the 
reciprocal of the tax shelter ratio (i.e., the fraction in which the 
amount of the applicable investment base is the numerator and the amount 
of the applicable deductions and credits is the denominator) by 50 
percent or more is a material change in facts. For example, if the tax 
shelter ratio increases from 2 to 1 to 4 to 1, the reciprocal of the tax 
shelter ratio decreases from \1/2\ to \1/4\, a 50-percent decrease. 
Similarly, if the tax shelter ratio decreases from 6 to 1 to 4 to 1, the 
reciprocal of the tax shelter ratio increases from \1/6\ to \1/4\, a 50-
percent increase. In either case, there is a material change in facts 
and an amended application could be filed.
    Q-45A. What information should be included on an amended application 
for registration?
    A-45A. The tax shelter organizer must include the identifying 
information requested on Form 8264, Application for Registration of a 
Tax Shelter, and the tax shelter registration number that has been 
assigned to the tax shelter. In addition, the tax shelter organizer 
should include any other information requested on Form 8364(1) that has 
changed since the tax shelter was registered, or (2) that the tax 
shelter organizer did not know at the time the tax shelter was 
registered but has learned of since the registration.
    For example, assume that A organizes partnership L, a blind pool 
that will invest in real estate. Before the real estate is identified or 
acquired, interests in L will be offered to the public in an offering 
that must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Although A does not know what real estate L will acquire and therefore 
is unable to calculate the tax shelter ratio with certainty, A concludes 
(based on representations made or to be made) that the tax shelter ratio 
will exceed 2 to 1 as to some of the investors. Accordingly, A registers 
L as a tax shelter. A attaches a statement to the application for 
registration, explaining that L is a blind pool organized to invest in 
real estate, but that L has not yet acquired any real estate. In 
addition, A attaches a statement explaining that although the tax 
shelter ratio is expected to exceed 2 to 1, A cannot compute the tax 
shelter ratio with certainty because L has not yet acquired any real 
estate. Several months after L is registered, L acquires a shopping 
center. A may file an amended application for registration. In addition 
to reporting the identifying information and the tax shelter 
registration number on the amended application, A should report the 
shopping center as the principal asset and the recomputed tax shelter 
ratio.
    As another example, assume that C organizes a limited partnership 
that is a tax shelter. On the application for registration, C reports 
that the tax shelter ratio is 2.2 to 1. After the partnership has been 
registered, C finds

[[Page 107]]

that the partnership is unable to attract sufficient investors. To make 
investing in the partnership more attractive, C decides to offer 
financing for the purchase or interests in the partnership. As a result 
of the change in financing, the tax shelter ratio will be 5 to 1. 
Because there is a change in financing and a change in the tax shelter 
ratio that decreases the reciprocal of the tax shelter ratio by 50 
percent or more, C may file an amended application for registration. In 
addition to reporting the identifying information and the tax shelter 
registration number on the amended application, C should report the 
recomputed tax shelter ratio and information relating to the change in 
financing.
    Q-46. If assets constituting a tax shelter are sold (``original 
sale'') and, subsequently, either the assets or interests in the assets 
are offered for sale by the purchaser (``resale''), must the purchaser 
file a new application for registration if the resale is an offering or 
sale of interests in a tax shelter?
    A-46. If the resale constitutes a tax shelter, the purchaser must 
file a new application for registration, unless the tax shelter 
organizer with respect to the original sale is also the tax shelter 
organizer with respect to the resale and the facts pertaining to the 
resale were reflected in the application for registration filed with 
respect to the original sale. For example, assume that A intends to sell 
a building with an estimated fair market value of $2.5 million to a 
group of 5 investors (i.e., a substantial investment, as defined in A-21 
of this section). A also intends to make representations of tax benefits 
attributable to an investment in the building. Based on these 
representations and the investment base, the tax shelter ratio 
attributable to an investment in the building may be greater than 2 to 
1. A therefore files an application for registration relating to the 
building with the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service 
issues a registration number for the investment, and A furnishes the 
registration number to each of the 5 investors in accordance with A-53 
of this section. In an unrelated transaction, the 5 investors decide to 
syndicate the building and to offer interests in the syndicate to 
approximately 500 investors. In connection with this offer, the 
investors expect to make representations concerning tax benefits with 
respect to the syndication. If based on these representations and the 
investment base, the tax shelter ratio may be greater than 2 to 1 for an 
investor in the syndicate, the 5 investors must file an application for 
registration for the syndicate before interests in the syndicate may be 
offered for sale. The investors in the syndicate must be furnished with 
the new registration number and not the registration number issued with 
respect to A. On the other hand, if the original sale and the 
syndication were part of A's plan to sell interests in the building, A 
is a tax shelter organizer with respect to the syndication. If the facts 
pertaining to the syndication were reflected on A's application for 
registration with respect to the original sale, a second application for 
registration would not be required with respect to the syndication. 
However, the investors in the syndicate would have to be furnished with 
the tax shelter registration number issued to A.
    Q-47. When is a tax shelter considered registered?
    A-47. A tax shelter is considered registered when a properly 
completed Form 8264, Application for Registration of a Tax Shelter, is 
filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center. See A-7 of 
Sec. 301.6111-2T for rules relating to the information required to be 
included on the form, and A-8 of Sec. 301.6707-1T for rules relating to 
the penalty for filing incomplete information.
    Q-48. Must a person registering a tax shelter that is a substantial 
investment only by reason of an aggregation of multiple investments 
under A-22 of this section complete a separate Form 8264 for each 
investment constituting part of the substantial investment?
    A-48. A separate Form 8264 must be completed for each investment 
that differs from the other investments in a substantial investment with 
respect to any of the following:
    (1) Principal asset,
    (2) Accounting methods,
    (3) Federal or state agencies with which the investment is 
registered or

[[Page 108]]

with which an exemption notice is filed,
    (4) Methods of financing the purchase of an interest in the 
investment,
    (5) Tax shelter ratio.
    Such aggregated investments, however, are part of a single tax 
shelter.
    Q-49. Do the rules of section 7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, 
regarding timely mailing, apply to the filing of registration forms?
    A-49. Yes.
    Q-50. After a tax shelter has been registered, may representations 
that the investment has been registered with the Internal Revenue 
Service be made to potential investors?
    A-50. Investors may be informed that the investment has been 
registered with the Internal Revenue Service. Investors also must be 
informed, however, that registration does not imply that the Internal 
Revenue Service has reviewed, examined, or approved the investment or 
the claimed tax benefits. The disclaimer must be substantially in the 
form provided below:
    ISSUANCE OF A REGISTRATION NUMBER DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THIS 
INVESTMENT OR THE CLAIMED TAX BENEFITS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED, EXAMINED, OR 
APPROVED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.
    See A-53 of this section for rules relating to the legend that must 
be included on any statement on which the tax shelter registration 
number is furnished to investors.

        Furnishing Tax Shelter Registration Numbers to Investors

    Q-51. Who must furnish investors in a tax shelter with the 
registration number of the tax shelter?
    A-51. Any person who sells (or otherwise transfers) an interest in a 
tax shelter is required to furnish the registration number assigned to 
that tax shelter to each person who purchases (or otherwise acquires) an 
interest in that tax shelter from the seller or transferor. For example, 
X, a tax shelter organizer, sells an interest in a tax shelter to A. One 
year later A sells A's interest in the shelter to B. X must furnish the 
tax shelter registration number to A, and A must furnish the number to 
B. If B sells or otherwise transfers the interest (by gift, for 
example), B must furnish the number to the purchaser or transferee of 
B's interest in the tax shelter.
    Q-52. When must the registration number be furnished to purchasers 
of interests in the tax shelter?
    A-52. The person who sells (or otherwise transfers) an interest in a 
tax shelter must furnish the registration number to the purchaser (or 
transferee) at the time of sale (or transfer) of the interest (or, if 
later, within 20 days after the seller or transferor receives the 
registration number). If the registration number is not furnished at the 
time of the sale (or other transfer), the seller (or transferor) must 
furnish the statement described in A-54 to the purchaser (or transferee) 
at the time of the sale (or other transfer). If interests in a tax 
shelter were sold before September 1, 1984, all investors who acquired 
their interests in the tax shelter before September 1, 1984, must be 
furnished with the registration number of the tax shelter by December 
31, 1984. The registration number will be considered furnished to the 
investor if it is mailed to the investor at the last address of the 
investor known to the person required to furnish the number.
    Q-53. How is a seller or transferor of an interest in a tax shelter 
required to furnish the registration number to investors?
    A-53. The person who sells (or otherwise transfers) an interest in a 
tax shelter must furnish the registration number of the tax shelter to 
the tax shelter to the purchaser (or transferee) on a written statement. 
The written statement shall show the name, registration number, and 
taxpayer identification number of the tax shelter, and include a 
prominent legend in bold and conspicuous type stating that the 
registration number must be included on any return on which the investor 
claims any deduction, loss, credit, or other tax benefit, or reports any 
income, by reason of the tax shelter. The statment must also include a 
prominent legend in bold and conspicuous type stating that the issuance 
of the registration number does not indicate that the Internal Revenue 
Service has reviewed, examined, or approved the investment or the 
claimed tax benefits.

[[Page 109]]

The statement shall be substantially in the form provided below:
    You have acquired an interest in [name and address of tax shelter] 
whose taxpayer identification number is [if any]. The Internal Revenue 
Service has issued [name of tax shelter] the following tax shelter 
registration number: [Number]
    YOU MUST REPORT THIS REGISTRATION NUMBER TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE 
SERVICE, IF YOU CLAIM ANY DEDUCTION, LOSS, CREDIT, OR OTHER TAX BENEFIT 
OR REPORT ANY INCOME BY REASON OR YOUR INVESTMENT IN [NAME OF TAX 
SHELTER].
    You must report the registration number (as well as the name, and 
taxpayer identification number of [name of tax shelter]) on Form 8271.
    FORM 8271 MUST BE ATTACHED TO THE RETURN ON WHICH YOU CLAIM THE 
DEDUCTION, LOSS, CREDIT, OR OTHER TAX BENEFIT OR REPORT ANY INCOME.
    ISSUANCE OF A REGISTRATION NUMBER DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THIS 
INVESTMENT OR THE CLAIMED TAX BENEFITS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED, EXAMINED, OR 
APPROVED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.
    This statement may be modified as necessary if the tax shelter is 
not a separate entity (e.g., certain Schedule F or Schedule C 
activities) or has no name or taxpayer identification number.
    Q-54. If a registration number has not been received by a seller (or 
transferor) from the person who registered the tax shelter by the time 
interests in the tax shelter are sold (or otherwise transferred), must 
the seller (or transferor) of the interests furnish the purchaser (or 
transferee) with any information regarding the registration?
    A-54. Yes. At the time of the sale (or other transfer) the seller 
(or other transferor) must furnish the purchaser (or transferee) with a 
written statement in substantially the form prescribed in A-53 of this 
section, except that the second sentence of the form prescribed in A-53 
shall be replaced by a statement in the form provided below:
    On behalf of [name of tax shelter], [name of tax shelter organizer 
who has applied for registration] has applied to the Internal Revenue 
Service for a tax shelter registration number. The number will be 
furnished to you when it is received.

            Including the Registration Number on Tax Returns

    Q-55. Is an investor required to report the registration number of a 
tax shelter in which the investor has acquired an interest to the 
Internal Revenue Service?
    A-55. Yes. Any person claiming any deduction, loss, credit, or other 
tax benefit by reason of a tax shelter must report the registration 
number of the tax shelter on Form 8271, Investor Reporting of Tax 
Shelter Registration Number, which must be attached to the return on 
which any deduction, loss credit, or other tax benefit attributable to 
the tax shelter is claimed. For purposes of determining whether the tax 
shelter registration number must be reported by an investor, income 
attributable to an investment, such as a partner's distributive share of 
income, constitutes a deduction or tax benefit that is claimed, because 
gross deductions and other tax benefits are included in the net income 
reported by the investor. Thus, the registration number also must be 
reported on any return on which an investor reports any income 
attributable to a tax shelter.
    Q-56. What should the investor do if the investor has received a 
notice that a registration number for the tax shelter has been applied 
for, but the investor has not received the registration number by the 
time the investor files a return on which a deduction, loss credit, 
other tax benefit, or income attributable to the tax shelter is 
included?
    A-56. The investor must attach to the return a Form 8271 with the 
words ``Applied For'' written in the space for the registration number 
and must include on the Form 8271 the name and taxpayer identification 
number (if any) of the tax shelter and the name of the person who has 
applied for registration of the tax shelter.

[[Page 110]]

    Q-57. Does the requirement to include the tax shelter registration 
number on a return apply to applications for tentative refund (Form 1045 
and Form 1139) and amended returns (Form 1040X, Form 1120X)?
    A-57. Yes. A completed Form 8271 must be attached to any such return 
on which any deduction, loss, credit, other tax benefit, or income 
relating to a tax shelter is included.

                      Projected Income Investments

    Q-57A. Are the registration requirements suspended with respect to 
any tax shelters?
    A-57A. Yes. If a tax shelter is a projected income investment, it is 
not required to be registered before the first offering for sale of an 
interest in the tax shelters occurs, but is subject only to the 
registration requirements set forth in A-57H through A-57J of this 
section. A tax shelter is a projected income investment if--
    (a) The tax shelter is not expected to reduce the cumulative tax 
liability of any investor for any year during the 5-year period 
described in A-4 (I) of this section; and
    (b) The assets of the tax shelter do not include or relate to any 
property described in A-57E of this section.
    Q-57B. Under what circumstances does a tax shelter satisfy the 
requirement of paragraph (a) of A-57A of this section?
    A-57B. A tax shelter is not expected to reduce the cumulative tax 
liability of any investor for any year during the 5-year period 
described in A-4 (I) of this section only if--
    (a) A written financial projection or other written representation 
that is provided to investors before the sale of interests in the 
investment states (or leads a reasonable investor to believe) that the 
investment will not reduce the cumulative tax liability of any investor 
with respect to any year (within the meaning of A-7 of this section) in 
such 5-year period; and
    (b) No written or oral projections or representations, other than 
those related to circumstances that are highly unlikely to occur, state 
(or lead a reasonable investor to believe) that the investment may 
reduce the cumulative tax liability of any investor with respect to any 
such year.

Thus, a tax shelter for which there are multiple written or oral 
financial projections or other representations is not a projected income 
investment if any such projection or representation that relates to 
circumstances that are not highly unlikely to occur states (or leads a 
reasonable investor to believe) that the investment may reduce the 
cumulative tax liability of any investor. See A-57D and A-57F of this 
section for rules relating to financial projections or other 
representations that are not made in good faith, that are not based on 
reasonable economic and business assumptions, or that relate to 
circumstances that are highly unlikely.
    Q-57C. When does an investment reduce the cumulative tax liability 
of an investor?
    A-57C. (a) An investment reduces the cumulative tax liability of an 
investor with respect to a year during the 5-year period described in A-
4 (I) of this section if, as of the close of such year, (i) cumulative 
projected deductions for the investor exceed cumulative projected income 
for the investor, or (ii) cumulative projected credits for the investor 
exceed cumulative projected tax liability (without regard to credits) 
for the investor.
    (b) The cumulative projected deductions for an investor as of the 
close of a year are the gross deductions of the investor with respect to 
the investment, for all periods up to (and including) the end of such 
year, that are included in the financial projection or upon which the 
representation is based. The deductions with respect to an investment 
include all deductions explicitly represented as being allowable and all 
deductions typically associated (within the meaning of A-9 of this 
section) with the investment. Therefore, interest to be paid by the 
investor that is taken into account in determining the tax shelter ratio 
of the investment (see A-11 of this section) is treated as a deduction 
with respect to the investment.
    (c) The cumulative projected income for an investor as of the close 
of a year is the gross income of the investor with

[[Page 111]]

respect to the investment, for all periods up to (and including) the end 
of such year, that is included in the financial projection or upon which 
the representation is based. For this purpose, income attributable to 
cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities (within the meaning of 
A-14 (4) of this section) may not be treated as income from the 
investment.
    (d) The cumulative projected credits for an investor as of the close 
of a year are the gross credits of the investor with respect to the 
investment, for all periods up to (and including) the close of such 
year, that are included in the financial projection or upon which the 
representation is based. The credits with respect to an investment 
include all credits explicitly represented as being allowable and all 
credits typically associated (within the meaning of A-9 of this section) 
with the investment.
    (e) The cumulative projected tax liability (without regard to 
credits) for an investor as of the close of a year is 50 percent of the 
excess of cumulative projected income for the investor over cumulative 
projected deductions for the investor with respect to the investment as 
of the close of such year.
    (f) The following examples illustrate the application of the 
principles of this A-57C:

    Example 1. The promotional material with respect to a tax shelter 
includes a written financial projection indicating that the expected 
income of the investment in each of its first 5 years is $800,000. In 
subsequent oral discussions, investors are advised that, in certain 
circumstances that are not highly unlikely, the income expected from the 
investment may be as little as $500,000 per year. The subsequent oral 
discussions are taken into account in determining whether any 
projections or representations state or lead a reasonable investor to 
believe that the investment may reduce the cumulative tax liability of 
any investor. Thus, if the written financial projections indicate that 
the gross deductions attributable to the investment in each of its first 
5 years are expected to be $600,000 and the subsequent oral discussions 
do not indicate that the amount of those deductions will change under 
the circumstances in which the income expected may be as little as 
$500,000, the subsequent oral discussions taken together with the 
written financial projections state (or lead a reasonable investor to 
believe) that the cumulative tax liability of an investor may be reduced 
(i.e., the subsequent oral discussions (taken together with the 
projections) state or lead a reasonable investor to believe that 
cumulative projected deductions may exceed cumulative projected income 
under circumstances that are not highly unlikely). Accordingly, under 
paragraph (b) of A-57B of this section, the tax shelter would not 
qualify as a projected income investment.
    Example 2. The written promotional material with respect to a tax 
shelter states that certain deductions are allowable to an investor 
(without specifying their amount), but there is no written statement 
relating to the amount of income expected from the investment. Because 
there is no written financial projection or other written representation 
that states or leads a reasonable investor to believe that the 
investment will not reduce the investor's cumulative tax liability 
(i.e., the cumulative projected deductions, although not specified in 
the projections, may exceed the cumulative projected income (0)), the 
requirement of paragraph (a) of A-57B of this section would not be 
satisifed. The result in this example would be the same if there were 
only oral representations that the income to be derived from the 
investment would exceed the deductions with respect to the investment, 
because there would be no written statement as required by paragraph (a) 
of A-57B of this section. The tax shelter in this case would qualify as 
a projected income investment, however, if the written promotional 
material contains good-faith representations based on reasonable 
economic and business assumptions that state or lead reasonable 
investors to believe that the cumulative projected income from the 
investment will exceed the cumulative projected deductions allowable 
with respect to the investment for each year in the 5-year period, even 
though the amounts of income and deductions are not specified.
    Example 3. The written promotional material with respect to a tax 
shelter includes a good-faith financial projection for the first 5 years 
of the investment. Based on reasonable economic and business 
assumptions, the projection indicates that the expected net income of 
the investment in each of its first 4 years is $100,000 ($500,000 of 
gross income and $400,000 of gross deductions), but as a result of the 
anticipated acquisition of new business assets a loss of $20,000 is 
expected in the fifth year of the investment ($500,000 of gross income 
and $520,000 of gross deductions). The projection also indicates that a 
credit of $50,000 is expected in the fifth year of the investment. Such 
a written financial projection would be considered to state that the 
investment will not reduce the cumulative tax liability of any investor 
with respect to any year in the 5-year period described in A-4 (I) of 
this section. Although a loss and a credit

[[Page 112]]

are projected in the fifth year of the investment, as of the close of 
such year, cumulative projected income ($2,500,000) exceeds cumulative 
projected deductions ($2,120,000), and cumulative projected tax 
liability (without regard to credits) ($380,000 x 50 percent = $190,000) 
exceeds cumulative projected credits ($50,000). Assuming no contrary 
oral or written projections or representations are made, the tax shelter 
would thus be a projected income investment.
    Example 4. The written promotional material with respect to a tax 
shelter states that an investor will be entitled to a ``1.5 to 1 write-
off'' in the year of investment. This statement is a representation that 
the investment will reduce the cumulative tax liability of an investor 
with respect to the first year of the investment and, accordingly, the 
investment is not a projected income investment. The result in this 
example would be the same if any ``write-off'' were represented, even if 
the write-off were less than 1.5 to 1.

    Q-57D. Are all financial projections and representations relating to 
the cumulative tax liability of an investor taken into account for 
purposes of A-57B of this section?
    A-57D. (a) No. A financial projection or other representation 
relating to the cumulative tax liability of an investor is not taken 
into account for purposes of A-57B of this section unless it is made in 
good faith and is based on reasonable economic and business assumptions. 
In addition, a financial projection or other representation is not taken 
into account if it relates to circumstances that are highly unlikely. 
Moreover, a general statement or disclaimer indicating that projected 
income is not guaranteed or otherwise assured, standing alone, is not a 
projection or representation for purposes of paragraph (b) of A-57B of 
this section.
    (b) The following example illustrates the application of the 
principles of this A-57D:

    Example. The written promotional material with respect to a tax 
shelter contains a representation stating that the investment is 
projected to produce net income for all investors in each of its first 
five years and there are no credits potentially allowable with respect 
to the investment. This statement is based on reasonable economic and 
business assumptions. Such a written representation, if made in good 
faith, would be considered under paragraph (a) of A-57B of this section 
to state that the investment will not reduce the cumulative tax 
liability of any investor with respect to any year in the 5-year period 
described in A-4(I) of this section. In addition, no oral or written 
statements or representations are communicated to investors that would 
indicate under paragraph (b) of A-57B of this section that the 
investment might reduce the cumulative tax liability of any investor 
with respect to any year in the 5-year period.
    Assume the tax shelter organizer has knowledge of certain other 
facts that lead the tax shelter organizer to believe that it is more 
likely than not that the investment will produce a net loss in the first 
year. The representation projecting net income is thus contrary to the 
tax shelter organizer's belief that it is more likely than not that the 
investment will produce a net loss in the first year. Therefore, the 
representation is not made in good faith. Since representations not made 
in good faith are ignored under A-57D, the tax shelter would not be a 
projected income investment. If, on the other hand, the tax shelter 
organizer did not know of the other facts so that the tax shelter 
organizer did not believe that the investment would produce a net loss 
in the first year, the representation projecting income is made in good 
faith. In that case, the tax shelter would be a projected income 
investment.

    Q-57E. What assets may not be held by a projected income investment?
    A-57E. A tax shelter is not a projected income investment if more 
than an incidental amount of its assets include or relate to any 
interest in a collectible (as defined in section 408(m)(2)), a master 
sound recording, motion picture or television film, videotape, 
lithograph plate, copyright, or a literary, musical, or artistic 
composition.
    Q-57F. What are the consequences if financial projections or other 
representations are not made in good faith or are not based on 
reasonable economic and business assumptions?
    A-57F. If a tax shelter is not a projected income investment because 
the financial projections or other representations are not made in good 
faith or are not based on reasonable economic and business assumptions, 
it must be registered not later than the day on which the first offering 
for sale of an interest in the tax shelter occurs. If the tax shelter is 
not registered timely, the tax shelter organizer may be subject to a 
penalty. (See A-1 of Sec. 301.6707-1T.)
    Q-57G. When does a tax shelter cease to be a projected income 
investment?

[[Page 113]]

    A-57G. A tax shelter ceases to be a projected income investment on 
the last day of the first year (as defined in A-7 of this section) in 
the 5-year period described in A-4 (I) of this section for which, for 
any investor, (i) the gross deductions allocable to the investor for 
that year and prior years exceed the gross income allocable to the 
investor for such years, or (ii) the credit allocable to the investor 
for that year and prior years exceed 50 percent of the amount by which 
gross income allocable to the investor exceeds gross deductions 
allocable to the investor for such years. For purposes of determining 
when a tax shelter ceases to be a projected income investment, the tax 
shelter organizer is not required to take into account interest that may 
be incurred by an investor with respect to debt described in A-14 (2) or 
(3) of this section, but is required to take into account interest 
incurred by an investor with respect to debt described in A-14 (1) of 
this section. In addition, the tax shelter organizer may not take into 
account income attributable to cash, cash equivalents, or marketable 
securities (within the meaning of A-14 (4) of this section).
    Q-57H. How does the requirement to register apply with respect to a 
tax shelter that is a projected income investment?
    A-57H. In the case of a tax shelter that is a projected income 
investment, registration is not required unless the tax shelter ceases 
to be a projected income investment under A-57G of this section. If the 
tax shelter ceases to be a projected income investment, the tax shelter 
organizer must register the tax shelter in accordance with the rules set 
forth in A-1 through A-39 and A-41 through A-50 of this section. The tax 
shelter must be registered--
    (a) Within 30 days after the date on which the tax shelter ceases to 
be a projected income investment, and
    (b) Before the date on which the tax shelter or a tax shelter 
organizer sends the investor any schedule of profit or loss, or income, 
deduction, or credit that may be used in preparing the investor's income 
tax return for the taxable year that includes the date on which the tax 
shelter ceases to be a projected income investment. If a tax shelter 
organizer fails to register timely as required by this A-57H, the tax 
shelter organizer may be subject to a penalty. (See A-1 of 
Sec. 301.6707-1T.) For example, assume that C is the principal organizer 
and general partner of a limited partnership. Interests in the 
partnership will be offered for sale in a public offering required to be 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. C knows that the 
tax shelter ratio (as defined in A-5 of this section) for the limited 
partners will be 5 to 1. Although C knows the partnership is a tax 
shelter, C does not register the partnership by the day on which the 
first offering for sale of an interest occurs because C believes the 
partnership is a projected income investment. In the second year of the 
partnership, the gross deductions allocable to each of the limited 
partners for the first two years of the partnership exceed the gross 
income allocable to the limited partners in such years. Thus, the 
partnership ceases to be a projected income investment under A-57G of 
this section. Assuming further that C continues as the general partner 
and knowingly fails to register the partnership as a tax shelter within 
the time prescribed in this A-57H, C will be subject to a penalty of 1 
percent of the aggregate amount invested in the partnership. Because 
there is an intentional disregard of the registration requirements, the 
$10,000 limitation will not apply.
    Q-57I. How does the requirement to furnish registration numbers (A-
51 through A-54 of this section) apply in the case of a tax shelter that 
is a projected income investment?
    A-57I. In the case of a tax shelter that is a projected income 
investment, a person who sells or transfers an interest in the tax 
shelter is not required to furnish a registration number under A-51 of 
this section or a notice under A-54 of this section unless the tax 
shelter ceases to be a projected income investment. If the tax shelter 
ceases to be a projected income investment, the tax shelter organizer 
who registers the tax shelter is required to furnish the registration 
number to all persons who the tax shelter organizer knows or has reason 
to know are participating in the sale of interests in the tax shelter 
and

[[Page 114]]

to all persons who the tax shelter organizer knows or has reason to know 
have acquired interests in the tax shelter. A person who sold (or 
otherwise transferred) an interest in the tax shelter before the date on 
which the tax shelter ceased to be a projected income investment is 
required to furnish the registration number to the purchaser or 
transferee as provided in A-51 of this section only if the seller or 
transferor knows or has reason to know that the tax shelter has ceased 
to be a projected income investment and that the tax shelter organizer 
who registered the tax shelter has not provided a registration number to 
such purchaser or transferee. In the case of persons who acquired 
interests in the tax shelter before the date on which the tax shelter 
ceased to be a projected income investment, the registration number must 
be provided not later than the date described in paragraph (b) of A-57H 
of this section or, if the tax shelter does not provide any schedule 
described in paragraph (b) of A-57H of this section, within 60 days 
after the date on which the tax shelter ceases to be a projected income 
investment. Thus, for example, if a tax shelter that ceases to be a 
projected income investment is a partnership, the tax shelter organizer 
would be required to provide the registration number to each partner not 
later than the date the Schedule K-1 for the year in which the tax 
shelter ceases to be a projected income investment is provided to each 
partner.
    The registration number must be provided in accordance with A-51 and 
A-52 of this section and must be accompanied by a statement explaining 
that the tax shelter has ceases to be a projected income investment and 
instructing the recipient to furnish the registration number to any 
persons to whom the recipient has sold or otherwise transferred 
interests in the tax shelter. A tax shelter organizer who fails to 
provide the registration number as provided in this A-57I may be subject 
to penalties. (See A-12 of Sec. 301.6707-1T.)
    Q-57J. How does the requirement to include the registration number 
on tax returns (A-55 through A-57 of this section) apply in the case of 
a tax shelter that is a projected income investment?
    A-57J. In the case of a tax shelter that is a projected income 
investment, an investor is not required to report a registration number 
on the investor's tax return unless the tax shelter ceases to be a 
projected income investment. If the tax shelter ceases to be a projected 
income investment, the requirements of A-55 through A-57 apply with 
respect to returns for taxable years ending on or after the date on 
which the tax shelter ceases to be a projected income investment.

                             Effective Dates

    Q-58. On what date does the requirement to register a tax shelter 
become effective?
    A-58. In general, a tax shelter must be registered if any interest 
in the tax shelter (other than an interest previously sold to an 
investor) is sold on or after September 1, 1984 (whether or not 
interests in the tax shelter were sold or offered for sale before 
September 1, 1984). The tax shelter must be registered with the Internal 
Revenue Service not later than the first day after August 31, 1984 on 
which an interest in the tax shelter is offered for sale.
    Q-59. By what date must the tax shelter registration number be 
furnished to investors who acquired interests before September 1, 1984 
in a tax shelter that is required to be registered.
    A-59. All investors who acquired their interests in a tax shelter 
before September 1, 1984 must be supplied with the tax shelter 
registration number by December 31, 1984. See A-52 of this section for 
the date by which registration numbers must be furnished to investors 
who acquire their interests on or after September 1, 1984.
    Q-60. What interests will be taken into account in determining 
whether an investment in which interests were sold before September 1, 
1984, is a substantial investment?
    A-60. The determination of whether an investment is a substantial 
investment will be made by taking into account only the interests that 
are offered for sale on or after September 1, 1984. An investment will 
be considered a substantial investment if there are expected to be 5 or 
more investors on or after September 1, 1984, and the aggregate amount 
offered for sale on or

[[Page 115]]

after September 1, 1984 is expected to exceed $250,000. Amounts received 
from the sale of interests before September 1, 1984, however, are taken 
into account in computing the amount of the penalty for failure to 
register.

Sec. 301.6112-1T  Questions and answers relating to the requirement to maintain a list of investors in potentially abusive tax shelters (temporary).

    The following questions and answers relate to the requirement to 
maintain a list of investors in potentially abusive tax shelters that is 
imposed by section 6112 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added 
by section 142 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369; 98 Stat. 
681):

                               In General

    Q-1: What requirements are imposed by section 6112 on persons who 
organize potentially abusive tax shelters (``organizers'') and persons 
who sell interests in such tax shelters (``sellers'')?
    A-1: Any organizer of a potentially abusive tax shelter generally 
must prepare and maintain for a specified period a list identifying 
certain persons who acquire interests in the tax shelter. Any seller of 
an interest in such a tax shelter generally must maintain a list 
identifying each person who acquires an interest in the tax shelter from 
the seller. The lists also must contain the other information required 
by this section. The organizer or seller also is required to make the 
list available for inspection upon request by the Internal Revenue 
Service. For the definition of a potentially abusive tax shelter, see A-
3 of this section. For the definition of an organizer of a potentially 
abusive tax shelter, see A-5 of this section. For the definition of a 
seller of an interest in a potentially abusive tax shelter, see A-6 of 
this section. For rules relating to the designation of one organizer to 
maintain a list in cases in which two or more organizers or sellers 
would be required to maintain the same list or portion of a list, see A-
11 through A-13 of this section. For the information that must be 
included on a list, see A-17 of this section. For the requirements 
relating to the retention of lists and making lists available for 
inspection, see A-19 through A-21 of this section.
    Q-2: What sanctions apply to an organizer or seller who fails 
properly to comply with the requirements of section 6112 and this 
section?
    A-2: Any organizer or seller who fails to comply with the applicable 
requirements shall be subject to the penalty imposed by section 6708. 
For rules relating to section 6708, see Sec. 301.6708-1T.

              Definition of Potentially Abusive Tax Shelter

    Q-3: What is the meaning of the term ``potentially abusive tax 
shelter''?
    A-3: A potentially abusive tax shelter (``tax shelter'') means (a) 
any investment that is a tax shelter required to be registered with the 
Internal Revenue Service under section 6111, and (b) any other entity, 
plan, or arrangement that is treated by regulations as a tax shelter for 
purposes of the list requirement. An investment that is required to be 
registered under section 6111 is a tax shelter even if the investment 
has not been properly registered with the Internal Revenue Service. See 
Sec. 301.6111-1T for rules relating to tax shelter registration.
    Q-4: Are any entities, plans, or arrangements other than those 
required to be registered with the Internal Revenue Service under 
section 6111 treated as tax shelters for purposes of the list 
requirement?
    A-4: Yes. For purposes of the list requirement, a tax shelter 
includes any tax shelter that is a projected income investment, as 
defined in A-57A of Sec. 301.6111-1T. The extent, if any, to which any 
other entity, plan or arrangement will be treated as a potentially 
abusive tax shelter for purposes of the list requirement will be 
prescribed in future regulations.

[[Page 116]]

             Persons Required To Maintain Lists of Investors

    Q-5: Who is an organizer of a tax shelter?
    A-5: An organizer is any person who is a principal organizer of a 
tax shelter under A-27 of Sec. 301.6111-1T. Thus, an organizer, for 
purposes of the list requirement, means any person who discovers, 
creates, investigates, or initiates the tax shelter investment, devises 
the business or financial plans for the tax shelter, or carries out 
those plans through negotiations or transactions with others.
    Q-6: Who is a seller of an interest in a tax shelter?
    A-6: For purposes of the list requirement, a seller is--
    (a) Any organizer, underwriter, broker, or dealer (or other similar 
person) who transfers any interest in a tax shelter;
    (b) Any agent who negotiates the transfer of any interest in a tax 
shelter for the tax shelter, an organizer, or other person described in 
paragraph (a) of this A-6; and
    (c) Any investor (i.e., a person not described in paragraph (a) of 
this A-6) who transfers any interest in a tax shelter.

For example, if a broker or underwriter purchases a block of interests 
in a tax shelter from an organizer and in turn sells those interests to 
individual investors, the broker or underwriter, under paragraph (a) of 
this A-6, is a seller for purposes of the list requirement. Moreover, if 
a broker or underwriter who purchases a block of interests in a tax 
shelter engages other brokers or agents to negotiate sales of interests, 
such other brokers or agents, under paragraph (b) of this A-6, are 
sellers for purposes of the list requirement. Similarly, if an organizer 
engages a broker or other agent to negotiate sales of interests in a tax 
shelter to investors, the broker or other agent, under paragraph (b) of 
this A-6, is a seller for purposes of the list requirement. If, on the 
other hand, an individual investor engages a broker or other agent to 
negotiate a sale of the investor's interest to another investor, the 
broker or other agent is not a seller for purposes of the list 
requirement. The individual investor who transfers the interest, 
however, would be a seller for purposes of the list requirement under 
paragraph (c) of this A-6.
    Q-7: What is the meaning of the term ``an interest'' in a tax 
shelter?
    A-7: An interest in a tax shelter includes any right to participate 
in the tax shelter by reason of (a) a partnership interest, a 
shareholder interest, or a beneficial interest in a trust, (b) any 
interest in property (including a leasehold interest), or (c) the entry 
into a leasing arrangement or a consulting, management, or other 
agreement for the performance of services.

                Persons Required To Be Included on a List

    Q-8: What persons are required to be included on a list maintained 
by an organizer?
    A-8: An organizer of a tax shelter must include on a list all 
persons who acquire interests in the tax shelter by reason of--
    (a) Any transfer of an interest made by the organizer (i.e., a 
transfer with respect to which the organizer, under paragraph (a) of A-6 
of this section, is also a seller) or through an agent of the organizer 
described in paragraph (b) of A-6 of this section;
    (b) Any transfer of an interest made by the tax shelter or through 
an agent of the tax shelter described in paragraph (b) of A-6 of this 
section (provided the organizer is involved in the tax shelter on the 
date of the transfer);
    (c) Any transfer of an interest made by or through a person related 
(within the meaning of section 168 (e)(4)) to the organizer or the tax 
shelter (provided the organizer is involved in the tax shelter on the 
date of the transfer);
    (d) Any transfer of an interest of which the organizer is informed 
(regardless of whether the organizer is so informed under A-15 of this 
section for the specific purpose of maintaining a list); and
    (e) Any other transfer of which the organizer knows or has reason to 
know whether on account of the duty of inquiry described in A-9 of this 
section or for any other reason.

    Example 1. Assume that A, an organizer, offers partnership interests 
in a tax shelter for

[[Page 117]]

sale through Y, a broker. In 1985, ten individual investors purchase 
partnership interests from A through Broker Y. A must include on A's 
list the ten individual investors, because organizers must include on 
their lists persons who acquire interests by reason of transfers with 
respect to which the organizers also are sellers within the meaning of 
paragraph (a) of A-6 of this section. Broker Y, who is a seller within 
the meaning of paragraph (b) A-6 of this section, also would be required 
to maintain a list containing the names of the ten individual investors 
(see A-10 of this section). See A-17 of this section for the other 
information required to be included on a list. See A-11 through A-13 of 
this section for rules relating to the designation of a single organizer 
to maintain a list for multiple organizers and sellers.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 and that, in 
addition, A is the tax matters partner (within the meaning of section 
6231) for the partnership. In 1986, A, as tax matters partner, is 
instructed to prepare a Form K-1 for partner Z, a corporation that 
acquired its interest from one of the ten investors. A would be required 
to include Z on A's list under paragraph (d) of this A-8 because A has 
been informed of the acquisition of an interest by Z.

    Q-9: When does an organizer have a duty to inquire with respect to 
transfers of interests in the tax shelter?
    A-9: An organizer has a duty to make a reasonable inquiry only with 
respect to transfers of interests in the tax shelter made by a seller 
described in paragraph (a) of A-6 of this section who acquired the 
interests from (a) the organizer or a person related (within the meaning 
of section 168(e)(4)) to the organizer, or (b) the tax shelter or a 
person related (within the meaning of section 168(e)(4)) to the tax 
shelter (provided the organizer is involved in the tax shelter on the 
date the interest is transferred to the seller). For example, if a 
broker or underwriter purchases a block of interests in a tax shelter 
from an organizer and in turn sells those interests to individual 
investors, the organizer has a duty to inquire with respect to such 
sales. If, as a result of the inquiry, the organizer knows the investors 
who acquired interests in the tax shelter from the broker or 
underwriter, the organizer would be required to include those persons on 
the list. (See paragraph (e) of A-8 of this section.) If the organizer 
fails reasonably to inquire with respect to transfers by a seller 
described in paragraph (a) of A-6 of this section, the organizer will 
have reason to know for purposes of paragraph (e) of A-8 of this section 
of those investors who acquired interests in the tax shelter from such a 
seller by reason of any transfer that the organizer would have 
discovered through a reasonable inquiry.
    Q-10: What persons are required to be included on a list maintained 
by a seller?
    A-10: Any list required to be maintained by a seller must identify 
each person who acquired an interest in the tax shelter from the seller, 
or, if the seller is an agent described in paragraph (b) of A-6 of this 
section, each person who acquired an interest through the seller. Any 
list required to be maintained by a seller described in paragraph (a) of 
A-6 of this section must also identify each person who acquired an 
interest of which the seller is informed under A-15 of this section.

            Designation of One Organizer To Maintain the List

    Q-11: If more than one person is required to maintain a list for the 
same tax shelter (i.e., multiple organizers, or organizers and sellers), 
may a single person be designated to maintain the list or a portion of 
the list for the tax shelter?
    A-11: Yes. Organizers and sellers who are required to maintain a 
list (or a portion of such a list) of persons who have acquired 
interests in the same tax shelter may designate one of the organizers 
(but not a seller who is not also an organizer) to maintain the required 
list or portion of the list (``designated person''). Organizers and 
sellers may not designate one person to maintain a list for the tax 
shelter, however, unless the tax shelter is timely and properly 
registered under section 6111 or unless the tax shelter is a projected 
income investment (as defined in A-57A of Sec. 301.6111-1T). If the tax 
shelter is registered with the Internal Revenue Service under section 
6111, the organizer who registered the tax shelter ordinarily should be 
the designated person, although any other organizer who meets the 
requirements of this A-11 may be the designated person. An organizer may 
not be a designated person, however, unless--

[[Page 118]]

    (a) It is reasonably expected that the organizer will actively 
participate in the management of the tax shelter as (i) a general 
partner of the tax shelter, (ii) an officer or director of the tax 
shelter, (iii) an officer or director of a corporate general partner of 
the tax shelter, or (iv) a trustee of the tax shelter; and
    (b) The organizer is not a resident of, and does not maintain its 
principal place of business in, a foreign country.
    Q-12: What must organizers and sellers do to designate one organizer 
to maintain a list under A-11 of this section?
    A-12: The organizers and sellers must enter into a written agreement 
that identifies the designated person and that is signed by all the 
parties to the agreement, including the designated person.
    Q-13: What are the consequences of an agreement under A-12 of this 
section?
    A-13: (a) If the tax shelter is not a projected income investment 
(as defined in A-57A of Sec. 301.6111-1T) at the time an agreement under 
A-12 of this section is signed, a seller or organizer who signs the 
agreement shall not be subject to penalty under section 6708 for failing 
to maintain a list provided that the seller or organizer--
    (1) Submits to the designated person all of the information that the 
organizer or seller otherwise would be required to maintain on a list 
(as described in A-8, A-10, and A-17 of this section), and
    (2) Provides to each investor (within the meaning of paragraph (c) 
of A-6 of this section) otherwise required to be included on a list 
maintained by such organizer or seller a notice in the form prescribed 
in paragraph (c) of this A-13.
    (b) If the tax shelter is a projected income investment (as defined 
in A-57A of Sec. 301.6111-1T) at the time an agreement under A-12 of 
this section is signed, a seller or organizer who signs the agreement 
shall not be subject to penalty under section 6708 for failing to 
maintain a list provided that the seller or organizer submits to the 
designated person all of the information that the organizer or seller 
otherwise would be required to maintain on a list (as described in A-8, 
A-10, and A-17 of this section). If the tax shelter ceases to be a 
projected income investment under A-57G of Sec. 301.6111-1T, the 
designated person must provide to each investor (within the meaning of 
paragraph (c) of A-6 of this section) required to be included on the 
list an explanation that the tax shelter has ceased to be projected 
income investment and a notice substantially in the form prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this A-13.
    (c) Any notice required to be provided to an investor (within the 
meaning of paragraph (c) of A-6 of this section) under paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this A-13 must be substantially in the form set forth below:

    You have acquired an interest in [name and address of tax shelter]. 
If you transfer your interest in this tax shelter to another person, you 
are required by the Internal Revenue Service to keep a list containing 
that person's name, address, taxpayer identification number, the date on 
which you transferred the interest, and the name, address, and tax 
shelter registration number of this tax shelter. If you do not want to 
keep such a list, you must (1) send the information specified above to 
[name and address of designated person], who will keep the list for this 
tax shelter, and (2) give a copy of this notice to the person to whom 
you transfer your interest.

This notice may be incorporated into the notice required by A-53 or A-54 
of Sec. 301.6111-1T (relating to tax shelter registration).
    (d) A designated person who fails to maintain a list shall be 
subject to penalty under section 6708. For special rules for determining 
the amount of the penalty imposed on a designated person under section 
6708, see A-6 of Sec. 301.6708.-1T.

 Additional Requirement Imposed on Sellers Who Do Not Sign Designation 
                               Agreements

    Q-14: Is any additional requirement imposed on a seller who does not 
sign an agreement under A-12 of this section to designate one organizer 
to maintain a list for a tax shelter?
    A-14: Yes. Any seller described in paragraph (a) of A-6 of this 
section who does not sign a designation agreement under A-12 of this 
section (including organizers who are such sellers) with respect to a 
tax shelter that is not a

[[Page 119]]

projected income investment must provide a notice to all investors 
(within the meaning of paragraph (c) of A-6 of this section) who acquire 
interests in the tax shelter from the seller. The notice must be 
substantially in the form prescribed in paragraph (c) of A-13 of this 
section except that the notice must include the name and address of the 
seller in place of the name and address of the designated person. In the 
case of a tax shelter that is a projected income investment (as defined 
in A-57A of Sec. 301.6111-1T), a notice to investors need not be 
provided until such time, if any, as the shelter ceases to be a 
projected income investment under A-57G of Sec. 301.6111-1T. In such a 
case, the seller shall provide, with the notice, an explanation that the 
tax shelter has ceased to be a projected income investment.

                  Special Rules Applicable to Investors

    Q-15: Under what circumstances is an investor described in paragraph 
(c) of A-6 of this section who retransfers an interest in a tax shelter 
not required to maintain a list disclosing the transferee's name and the 
other information required by A-17 of this section?
    A-15: An investor who retransfers an interest in a tax shelter that 
is projected income investment (as defined in A-57A of Sec. 301.6111-1T) 
is not required to maintain a list with respect to the retransfer unless 
the tax shelter ceases to be a projected income investment under A-57G 
of Sec. 301.6111-1T prior to the retransfer. In addition, any investor 
who is required to maintain a list for a tax shelter (including a tax 
shelter that has ceased to be a projected income investment) may require 
a designated person or a seller identified in a notice provided under 
either A-13 or A-14 of this section to maintain the investor's list (and 
the investor will thus not be subject to any penalty under section 6708 
for failing to maintain the list) by--
    (a) Submitting to the designated person or seller so identified all 
of the information that the investor otherwise would be required to 
maintain on a list for that tax shelter, and
    (b) Providing a copy of the notice furnished to the investor under 
either A-13 or A-14 of this section to the person or persons to whom the 
investor retransfers an interest in the tax shelter.

    Example. Assume that X, an organizer, retains brokers A and B to 
sell interests in a tax shelter that is not a projected income 
investment. In 1985, A and B each negotiate sales of interests in the 
tax shelter to investors. Assume that X timely and properly registered 
the tax shelter under section 6111. A, B, and X enter into an agreement 
to designate X to maintain the list of investors who acquired interests 
in the tax shelter through A and B. Pursuant to the agreement, A and B 
submit the required information to X and provide the required notice to 
the investors who acquired interests through A and B. On January 1, 
1986, C, an investor who acquired an interest through A, sells the 
interest to D. Since C was provided with the notice required by A-13 of 
this section, C may require X to maintain C's list with respect to the 
sale to D by submitting to X all of the required information regarding 
the sale and by providing a copy of the notice to D. If A, B, and X had 
not signed an agreement, X, a seller described in paragraph (a) of A-6 
of this section, would nevertheless have been required to provide a 
notice to C (under A-14 of this section) and C would have been able to 
require X to keep the list by complying with the two requirements of 
this A-15. In the absence of an agreement, however, A and B, who are 
sellers described in paragraph (b) of A-6 of this section, would have 
been required to keep lists of investors with whom they negotiated 
sales.

                Manner in Which List Shall Be Maintained

    Q-16: In what manner must an organizer or a seller maintain a list?
    A-16: A list may be maintained on paper, card file, magnetic media, 
or in any other form, provided the method of maintaining the list 
enables the Internal Revenue Service to determine without undue delay or 
difficulty the information required by A-17 of this section.
    Q-17: What information must be included on a list?
    A-17: A list must contain the following information:
    (1) The name of the tax shelter and the registration number, if any, 
obtained under section 6111;
    (2) The TIN (as defined in section 7701(a)(41)), if any, of the tax 
shelter;
    (3) The name, address, and TIN (as defined in section 7701(a)(41)) 
of each person who is required to be included

[[Page 120]]

on the list under A-8 or A-10 of this section;
    (4) The number of units (i.e., percentage of profits, number of 
shares, etc.) acquired by each person who is required to be included on 
the list;
    (5) The date on which each interest was acquired;
    (6) If the interest was not acquired from the person maintaining the 
list, the name of the person from whom the interest was acquired; and
    (7) The name and address of each agent of the person maintaining the 
list who is described in paragraph (b) of A-6 of this section.

If the person maintaining the list is an investor described in paragraph 
(c) of A-6 of this section, the list is required to include only the 
information specified in items (1), (3) and (5).
    Q-18: If a person is required to maintain lists for more than one 
tax shelter, how should the lists be arranged?
    A-18: A separate list, identified by the registration number 
obtained under section 6111 (or if there is no registration number, the 
name of the tax shelter), must be maintained for each tax shelter.

                           Retention of Lists

    Q-19: How long must organizers and sellers retain a list?
    A-19: A list generally must be retained for 7 years following the 
date on which the last acquisition of an interest required to be 
included on the list is made (not including any acquisition for which an 
organizer or seller is required to maintain a list under A-15 or 
paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) of A-8 of this section). In the case of 
any acquisition of an interest for which an organizer or seller is 
required to maintain a list under A-15 or paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) 
of A-8 of this section, the list with respect to the acquisition must be 
retained for the longer of the 7-year period determined under the 
preceding sentence, or the 3-year period following the date on which the 
interest is acquired.
    Q-20: Who must retain the list if the person required to maintain 
the list is a corporation or a partnership that is dissolved or 
liquidated before completion of the period determined under A-19 of this 
section?
    A-20: If a list is required to be maintained by a corporation or 
partnership that is dissolved or liquidated before completion of the 
period determined under A-19 of this section, the list shall be retained 
by the person or persons who under state law are responsible for winding 
up the affairs of the corporation or partnership. If state law does not 
specify any person or persons as responsible for winding up, then, 
collectively, the directors of the corporation or general partners of 
the partnership shall be responsible for retaining the list.

                       Availability for Inspection

    Q-21: When must a person required to maintain a list make the list 
available for inspection?
    A-21: Any person required to maintain a list must, upon request by 
the Internal Revenue Service, make the list available for inspection as 
soon as practicable, but in no event later than 10 calendar days after 
such request. The request need not be in the form of an administrative 
summons.

                             Effective Date

    Q-22: With respect to what interests must an organizer or a seller 
maintain a list?
    A-22: An organizer or seller must maintain a list with respect to 
any interest in the tax shelter other than an interest that was acquired 
before September 1, 1984, by an investor (within the meaning of 
paragraph (c) of A-6 of this section). Thus, if an organizer sells 
interests in a tax shelter to investors both before September 1, 1984, 
and after August 31, 1984, the organizer must maintain a list 
identifying only those inventors to whom the organizer sells an interest 
after August 31, 1984. The organizer is not required to include on the 
list investors who acquire interests in the tax shelter after August 31, 
1984, from other individual investors who acquired the interests before 
September 1, 1984.

    Example. Assume that on August 21, 1984, A, an organizer, sells a 
block of interests in a tax shelter to B, an underwriter, and an 
interest in the tax shelter to C, an investor. Assume also, that, on 
September 12, 1984, B sells to D, an investor, one of the interests that 
B acquired on August 21, 1984. A is not

[[Page 121]]

required to maintain a list with respect to the interest sold to C 
because that interest was acquired by an investor before September 1, 
1984. B, who is a seller described in paragraph (a) of A-6 of this 
section, is required to maintain a list with respect to the interest 
sold to D because that interest was not sold to an investor before 
September 1, 1984. In addition, A is required to maintain a list with 
respect to the interest sold to D if A knows or has reason to know of 
the sale to D. (See paragraph (e) of A-8 and A-9 of this section.)

<R05>
Sec. 301.6114-1  Treaty-based return positions.

    (a) Reporting requirement--(1) General rule. (i) Except as provided 
in paragraph (c) of this section, if a taxpayer takes a return position 
that any treaty of the United States (including, but not limited to, an 
income tax treaty, estate and gift tax treaty, or friendship, commerce 
and navigation treaty) overrules or modifies any provision of the 
Internal Revenue Code and thereby effects (or potentially effects) a 
reduction of any tax incurred as any time, the taxpayer shall disclose 
such return position on a statement (in the form required in paragraph 
(d) of this section) attached to such return.
    (ii) If a return of tax would not otherwise be required to be filed, 
a return must, nevertheless, be filed for purposes of making the 
disclosure required by this section. For this purpose, such return need 
include only the taxpayer's name, address, Taxpayer Identification 
Number (if any), and be signed under the penalties of perjury (as well 
as the subject disclosure). Also, the taxpayer's taxable year shall be 
deemed to be the calendar year (unless the taxpayer has previously 
established, or timely chooses for this purpose to establish, a 
different taxable year).
    (2) Application. (i) A taxpayer is considered to adopt a ``return 
position'' when the taxpayer determines its tax liability with respect 
to a particular item of income, deduction or credit. A taxpayer may be 
considered to adopt a return position whether or not a return is 
actually filed. To determine whether a return position is a ``treaty-
based return position'' so that reporting is required under this 
paragraph (a), the taxpayer must compare:
    (A) The tax liability (including credits, carrybacks, carryovers, 
and other tax consequences or attributes for the current year as well as 
for any other affected tax years) to be reported on a return of the 
taxpayer, and
    (B) The tax liability (including such credits, carrybacks, 
carryovers, and other tax consequences or attributes) that would be 
reported if the relevant treaty provision did not exist.

If there is a difference (or potential difference) in these two amounts, 
the position taken on a return is a treaty-based return position that 
must be reported.
    (ii) In the event a taxpayer's return position is based on a 
conclusion that a treaty provision is consistent with a Code provision, 
but the effect of the treaty provision is to alter the scope of the Code 
provision from the scope that it would have in the absence of the 
treaty, then the return position is a treaty-based return position that 
must be reported.
    (iii) A return position is a treaty-based return position unless the 
taxpayer's conclusion that no reporting is required under paragraphs 
(a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section has a substantial probability of 
successful defense if challenged.
    (3) Examples. The application of section 6114 and paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1: X, a Country A corporation, claims the benefit of a 
provision of the income tax treaty between the United States and Country 
A that modifies a provision of the Code. This position does not result 
in a change of X's U.S. tax liability for the current tax year but does 
give rise to, or increases, a net operating loss which may be carried 
back (or forward) such that X's tax liability in the carryback (or 
forward) year may be affected by the position taken by X in the current 
year. X must disclose this treaty-based return position with its tax 
return for the current tax year.
    Example 2: Z, a domestic corporation, is engaged in a trade or 
business in Country B.

[[Page 122]]

Country B imposes a tax on the income from certain of Z's petroleum 
activities at a rate significantly greater than the rate applicable to 
income from other activities. Z claims a foreign tax credit for this tax 
on its tax return. The tax imposed on Z is specifically listed as a 
creditable tax in the income tax treaty between the United States and 
Country B; however, there is no specific authority that such tax would 
otherwise be a creditable tax for U.S. purposes under sections 901 or 
903 of the Code. Therefore, in the absence of the treaty, the 
creditability of this petroleum tax would lack a substantial probability 
of successful defense if challenged, and Z must disclose this treaty-
based return position (see also paragraph (b)(7) of this section).

    (b) Reporting specifically required. Reporting is required under 
this section except as expressly waived under paragraph (c) of this 
section. The following list is not a list of all positions for which 
reporting is required under this section but is a list of particular 
positions for which reporting is specifically required. These positions 
are as follows:
    (1) That a nondiscrimination provision of a treaty precludes the 
application of any otherwise applicable Code provision, other than with 
respect to the making of or the effect of an election under section 
897(i);
    (2) That a treaty reduces or modifies the taxation of gain or loss 
from the disposition of a United States real property interest;
    (3) That a treaty exempts a foreign corporation from (or reduces the 
amount of tax with respect to) the branch profits tax (section 884(a)) 
or the tax on excess interest (section 884(f)(1)(B));
    (4) That, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
    (i) A treaty exempts from tax, or reduces the rate of tax on, 
interest or dividends paid by a foreign corporation that are from 
sources within the United States by reason of section 861(a)(2)(B) or 
section 884(f)(1)(A); or
    (ii) A treaty exempts from tax, or reduces the rate of tax on, fixed 
or determinable annual or periodical income subject to withholding under 
sections 1441 or 1442 that a foreign person receives from a U.S. person, 
but only if--
    (A) the payment is not properly reported to the Service on a Form 
1042S; and
    (B) The foreign person is any of the following:
    (1) A controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) in 
which the U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder within the meaning of 
section 951(b);
    (2) A foreign corporation that is controlled within the meaning of 
section 6038 by the U.S. person;
    (3) A foreign shareholder of the U.S. person that, in the case of 
tax years beginning on or before July 10, 1989, is controlled within the 
meaning of section 6038A by the foreign shareholder, or, in the case of 
tax years beginning after July 10, 1989, is 25-percent owned within the 
meaning of section 6038A by the foreign shareholder; or
    (4) With respect to payments made after October 10, 1990, a foreign 
related party, as defined in section 6038A (c)(2)(B), the the U.S. 
person; or
    (5) That, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, under a 
treaty--
    (i) Income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or 
business of a foreign corporation or a nonresident alien is not 
attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base of operations 
in the United States and, thus, is not subject to taxation on a net 
basis, or that
    (ii) Expenses are allowable in determining net business income so 
attributable, notwithstanding an inconsistent provision of the Code;
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, that a 
treaty alters the source of any item of income or deduction; or
    (7) That a treaty grants a credit for a specific foreign tax for 
which a foreign tax credit would not be allowed by the Code.
     (c) Reporting requirement waived. Pursuant to the authority 
contained in section 6114 (b), reporting is waived under this section 
with respect to any of the following return positions taken by the 
taxpayer:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) (4) or (5) of this section, 
that a treaty has reduced the rate of withholding tax otherwise 
applicable to a particular type of fixed or determinable annual or 
periodical income subject to withholding under section 1441 or 1442, 
such as dividends, interest, rents, or royalties;

[[Page 123]]

    (2) That residency of an individual is determined under a treaty and 
apart from the Code;
    (3) That a treaty reduces or modifies the taxation of income derived 
from dependent personal services, pensions, annuities, social security 
and other public pensions, or income derived by artistes, athletes, 
students, trainees or teachers;
    (4) That income of an individual is resourced (for purposes of 
applying the foreign tax credit limitation) under a treaty provision 
relating to elimination of double taxation;
    (5) That a nondiscrimination provision of a treaty allows the making 
of an election under section 897(i);
    (6) That a Social Security Totalization Agreement or a Diplomatic or 
Consular Agreement reduces or modifies the taxation of income derived by 
the taxpayer; or
    (7) That a treaty exempts the taxpayer from the excise tax imposed 
by section 4371, but only if:
    (i) The person claiming such treaty-based return position is an 
insured, as defined in section 4372(d) (without the limitation therein 
referring to section 4371(1)), or a U.S. or foreign broker of insurance 
risks,
    (ii) Reporting under this section that would otherwise be required 
to be made by foreign insurers or reinsurers on a Form 720 on a 
quarterly basis is made on an annual basis on a Form 720 by a date no 
later than the date on which the return is due for the first quarter 
after the end of the calendar year, or
    (iii) A closing agreement relating to entitlement to the exemption 
from the excise tax has been entered into with the Service by the 
foreign insurance company that is the beneficial recipient of the 
premium that is subject to the excise tax.

Reporting is waived for an individual where payments or income items 
other-wise reportable under this section received by the individual 
during the course of the taxable year do not exceed $10,000 in the 
aggregate. Reporting with respect to payments or income items the 
treatment of which is mandated by the terms of a closing agreement with 
the Service, and that would otherwise be subject to the reporting 
requirements of this section, is also waived. In addition, if a 
partnership, trust, or estate that has the taxpayer as a partner or 
beneficiary discloses on its information return a position for which 
reporting is otherwise required by the taxpayer, the taxpayer (partner 
or beneficiary) is then excused from disclosing that position on a 
return. Also, this section does not apply to a withholding agent with 
respect to the performance of its withholding functions.
    (d) Information to be reported. If reporting is required under this 
section, the following information must be furnished in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section as an attachment to the return and set 
forth with the indicated heading and with paragraphs labeled to 
correspond with the numbers set forth below:

       Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114

    (1) Taxpayer's name, T.I.N. (if any), and address both in the 
country of residence and in the United States;
    (2) Name, T.I.N. (if available to the taxpayer), and address in the 
United States of the payor of the income (if fixed, determinable, 
annual, or periodical);
    (3) A statement whether the taxpayer (if an individual) is a U.S. 
citizen or resident or (if a corporation) is incorporated in the United 
States;
    (4) A separate statement of facts relied upon to support each 
separate position taken, including for each position:
    (i) The nature and amount (or a reasonable estimate thereof) of 
gross receipts, each separate gross payment, each separate gross income 
item, or other item (as applicable) for which the treaty benefit is 
claimed,
    (ii) An explanation of the position taken with a brief summary of 
the facts on which it is based,
    (iii) The specific treaty provision relied upon,
    (iv) The Code provision(s) overruled or modified, and
    (v) The provision(s) of the limitation on benefits article (if any) 
in the treaty which the taxpayer relies upon to prevent application of 
that article.


[[Page 124]]


For purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, if a taxpayer takes 
a position that it does not have a permanent establishment or fixed base 
in the United States and properly discloses that position, it need not 
separately report its payment of actual or deemed dividends or interest 
exempt from tax by reason of a treaty (or any liability for tax imposed 
by reason of section 884). Also, for purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of 
this section, a taxpayer may treat payments or income items of the same 
type (e.g., interest items) received from the same ultimate payor (e.g., 
the obligor on a note) as a single separate payment or income item. For 
purposes of paragraph (d)(4), if a taxpayer takes the return position 
that, under a treaty, income that is effectively connected with a U.S. 
trade or business is not subject to U.S. taxation because it is derived 
from sources outside of the United States, the taxpayer may treat 
payments or income items of the same type (e.g., interest items) as a 
single separate payment or income item. In addition, income from 
separate sales or services, whether or not made by an agent (independent 
or dependent), to different U.S. customers on behalf of a foreign 
corporation not having a permanent establishment in the United States 
may be treated as a single payment or income item. For purposes of 
reporting by foreign insurers or reinsurers, as described in paragraph 
(c)(7)(ii) of this section, such reporting must separately set forth 
premiums paid with respect to: casualty insurance and indemnity bonds 
(subject to section 4371(1)); life insurance, sickness and accident 
policies, and annuity contracts (subject to section 4371(2)); and 
reinsurance (subject to section 4371(3)). All premiums paid with respect 
to each of these three categories may be treated as a single payment or 
income item within the category. For reports first due before May 1, 
1991, the report may disclose, for each of the three categories, the 
total amount of premiums derived by the foreign insurer or reinsurer in 
U.S. dollars (even if a portion of these premiums relate to risks that 
are not U.S. situs). Reasonable estimates of the amounts required to be 
disclosed will satisfy these reporting requirements.
    (e) Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years of 
the taxpayer for which the due date for filing returns (without 
extensions) occurs after December 31, 1988. However, if--
    (1) A taxpayer has filed a return for such a taxable year, without 
complying with the reporting requirement of this section, before 
November 13, 1989, or
    (2) A taxpayer is not otherwise than by paragraph (a) of this 
section required to file a return for a taxable year before November 13, 
1989,

Such taxpayer must file (apart from any earlier filed return) the 
statement required by paragraph (d) of this section before June 12, 
1990, by mailing the required statement to the Internal Revenue Service, 
P.O. Box 21086, Philadelphia, PA 19114. Any such statement filed apart 
from a return must be dated, signed and sworn to by the taxpayer under 
the penalties of perjury. In addition, with respect to any return due 
(without extensions) on or before March 10, 1990, the reporting required 
by paragraph (a) of this section must be made no later than June 12, 
1990. If a taxpayer files or has filed a return on or before November 
13, 1989, that provides substantially the same information required by 
paragraph (d) of this section, no additional submission will be 
required. Foreign insurers and reinsurers subject to reporting described 
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section must so report for calendar 
years 1988 and 1989 no later than August 15, 1990.
    (f) Cross reference. For the provisions concerning penalties for 
failure to disclose a treaty-based return position, see section 6712 and 
Sec. 301.6712-1.

Sec. 301.6155-1   Payment on notice and demand.

    Upon receipt of notice and demand from the district director 
(including the Director of International Operations) or the director of

additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties) 
stated in such notice and demand.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6159-1  Agreements for payment of tax liability in installments.

    (a) Authority and definition. A district director, a director of a 
service center, or a director of a compliance center (the director) is 
authorized to enter into a written agreement with a taxpayer that allows 
the taxpayer to satisfy a tax liability by making scheduled periodic 
payments until the liability is fully paid if the director determines 
that such an installment agreement will facilitate the collection of the 
tax liability.
    (b) Acceptance, form, and term of installment agreement--(1)(i) 
Acceptance or rejection of installment agreement. The director has the 
discretion to accept or reject any proposed installment agreement. As a 
condition to entering into an installment agreement with a taxpayer, the 
director may require that--
    (A) The taxpayer agree to a reasonable extension of the period of 
limitations on collection; and
    (B) The agreement contain terms and conditions that protect the 
interests of the government.
    (ii) Example. The director may require that a taxpayer authorize 
direct debit bank transfers as the method of making installment payments 
under the agreement.
    (2) Form of installment agreement. A written installment agreement 
may take the form of a document signed by the taxpayer and the director 
or a written confirmation of an agreement entered into by the taxpayer 
and the director that is mailed or personally delivered to the taxpayer.
    (3) Term of accepted installment agreement. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section, an installment agreement is effective from the 
day the director signs the agreement to the day the agreement ends by 
its terms.
    (c) Alteration, modification, or termination of installment 
agreements by the Internal Revenue Service--(1) Inadequate information 
or jeopardy. The director may terminate an installment agreement if--
    (i) The director determines that the taxpayer or the taxpayer's 
representative has provided to the Internal Revenue Service information 
that is inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect in connection 
with the granting of the installment agreement; or
    (ii) The director determines that collection of any tax liability to 
which the installment agreement applies is in jeopardy.
    (2) Subsequent change in financial condition, failure to timely pay 
an installment or another Federal tax liability, or failure to provide 
requested financial information. The director may alter, modify, or 
terminate the terms of an installment agreement if--
    (i) The director determines that the financial condition of a 
taxpayer that is a party to the installment agreement has significantly 
improved; or
    (ii) The taxpayer that is a party to the installment agreement 
fails--

[[Page 126]]

    (A) To timely pay any installment in accordance with the terms of 
the installment agreement;
    (B) To pay any other Federal tax liability when the liability 
becomes due; or
    (C) To provide updated financial information requested by the 
director.
    (3) Request by taxpayer. Upon request by a taxpayer that is a party 
to the installment agreement, the director may alter, modify, or 
terminate the terms of an installment agreement if the director 
determines that the financial condition of the taxpayer has 
significantly changed.
    (4) Notice. Unless the director determines that collection of the 
tax is in jeopardy, the director will notify the taxpayer in writing at 
least 30 days before altering, modifying, or terminating an installment 
agreement pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section. A notice 
provided pursuant to this paragraph must briefly describe the reason for 
the intended alteration, modification, or termination. Upon receiving 
notice, the taxpayer may provide information showing that the reason for 
the intended alteration, modification, or termination is incorrect.
    (d) Actions by the Internal Revenue Service during the term of the 
installment agreement. Except as otherwise provided by the installment 
agreement, during the term of the agreement the director may take 
actions to protect the interests of the government with regard to the 
unpaid balance of the tax liability to which the installment agreement 
applies (other than actions pursuant to subchapter D of chapter 64 of 
subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code against a person that is a party 
to the agreement), including any actions enumerated in the agreement. 
The actions include, for example--
    (1) Requesting updated financial information from any party to the 
agreement;
    (2) Conducting further investigations (including the issuance and 
enforcement of summonses) in connection with the tax liability to which 
the installment agreement applies;
    (3) Filing or refiling notices of federal tax lien; and
    (4) Taking collection action against any person who is not a party 
to the agreement but who is liable for the tax to which the agreement 
applies.
    (e) Termination. If an installment agreement is terminated by the 
director, the director may pursue collection of the unpaid balance of 
the tax liability.
    (f) Cross-reference. Pursuant to section 6601(b)(1), the last day 
prescribed for payment is determined without regard to any installment 
agreement, including for purposes of computing penalties and interest 
provided by the Internal Revenue Code.
    (g) Effective date. This section is effective December 23, 1994.

Assessment--Table of Contents

<R05>


                               In General


<R05>
Sec. 301.6201-1   Assessment authority.

    (a) In general. The district director is authorized and required to 
make all inquiries necessary to the determination and assessment of all 
taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or any prior internal 
revenue law. The district director is further authorized and required, 
and the director of the regional service center is authorized, to make 
the determinations and the assessments of such taxes. However, certain 
inquiries and determinations are, by direction of the Commissioner, made 
by other officials, such as assistant regional commissioners. The term 
``taxes'' includes interest, additional amounts, additions to the taxes, 
and assessable penalties. The authority of the district director and the 
director of the regional service center to make assessments includes the 
following:
    (1) Taxes shown on return. The district director or the director of 
the regional service center shall assess all taxes determined by the 
taxpayer or by the district director or the director of the regional 
service center and disclosed on a return or list.
    (2) Unpaid taxes payable by stamp. (i) If without the use of the 
proper stamp:
    (a) Any article upon which a tax is required to be paid by means of 
a stamp is sold or removed for sale or use by the manufacturer thereof, 
or
    (b) Any transaction or act upon which a tax is required to be paid 
by means of a stamp occurs;

The district director, upon such information as he can obtain, must 
estimate the amount of the tax which has not been paid and the district 
director or the director of the regional service center must make 
assessment therefor upon the person the district director determines to 
be liable for the tax. However, the district director or the director of 
the regional service center may not assess any tax which is payable by 
stamp unless the taxpayer fails to pay such tax at the time and in the 
manner provided by law or regulations.
    (ii) If a taxpayer gives a check or money order as a payment for 
stamps but the check or money order is not paid upon presentment, then 
the district director or the director of the regional service center 
shall assess the amount of the check or money order against the taxpayer 
as if it were a tax due at the time the check or money order was 
received by the district director.
    (3) Erroneous income tax prepayment credits. If the amount of income 
tax withheld or the amount of estimated income tax paid is overstated by 
a taxpayer on a return or on a claim for refund, the amount so 
overstated which is allowed against the tax shown on the return or which 
is allowed as a credit or refund shall be assessed by the district 
director or the director of the regional service center in the same 
manner as in the case of a mathematical error on the return. See section 
6213 (b)(1), relating to exceptions to restrictions on assessment.
    (b) Estimated income tax. Neither the district director nor the 
director of the regional service center shall assess any amount of 
estimated income tax required to be paid under section 6153 or 6154 
which is unpaid.
    (c) Compensation of child. Any income tax assessed against a child, 
to the extent of the amount attributable to income included in the gross 
income of the child solely by reason of section 73(a) or the 
corresponding provision of prior law, if not paid by the child, shall, 
for the purposes of the income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (or 
the corresponding provisions of

[[Page 128]]

prior law), be considered as having also been properly assessed against 
the parent. In any case in which the earnings of the child are included 
in the gross income of the child solely by reason of section 73(a) or 
the corresponding provision of prior law, the parent's liability is an 
amount equal to the amount by which the tax assessed against the child 
(and not paid by him) has been increased by reason of the inclusion of 
such earnings in the gross income of the child. Thus, if for the 
calendar year 1954 the child has income of $1,000 from investments and 
of $3,000 for services rendered, and the latter amount is includible in 
the gross income of the child under section 73(a) and the child has no 
wife or dependents, the tax liability determined under section 3 is 
$625. If the child had only the investment income of $1,000, his tax 
liability would be $62. If the tax of $625 is assessed against the 
child, the difference between $625 and $62, or $563, is the amount of 
such tax which is considered to have been properly assessed against the 
parent, if not paid by the child.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6203-1   Method of assessment.

    The district director and the director of the regional service 
center shall appoint one or more assessment officers. The district 
director shall also appoint assessment officers in a Service Center 
servicing his district. The assessment shall be made by an assessment 
officer signing the summary record of assessment. The summary record, 
through supporting records, shall provide identification of the 
taxpayer, the character of the liability assessed, the taxable period, 
if applicable, and the amount of the assessment. The amount of the 
assessment shall, in the case of tax shown on a return by the taxpayer, 
be the amount so shown, and in all other cases the amount of the 
assessment shall be the amount shown on the supporting list or record. 
The date of the assessment is the date the summary record is signed by 
an assessment officer. If the taxpayer requests a copy of the record of 
assessment, he shall be furnished a copy of the pertinent parts of the 
assessment which set forth the name of the taxpayer, the date of 
assessment, the character of the liability assessed, the taxable period, 
if applicable, and the amounts assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6204-1  Supplemental assessments.

    If any assessment is incomplete or incorrect in any material 
respect, the district director or the director of the regional service 
center, subject to the restrictions with respect to the assessment of 
deficiencies in income, estate, gift, chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes, 
and subject to the applicable period of limitation, may make a 
supplemental assessment for the purpose of correcting or completing the 
original assessment.

chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).

                          Deficiency Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 301.6211-1  Deficiency defined.

    (a) In the case of the income tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code, 
the estate tax imposed by chapter 11, subtitle B, of the Code, the gift 
tax imposed by chapter 12, subtitle B, of the Code, and any excise tax 
imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 of the Code, the term 
``deficiency'' means the excess of the tax, (income, estate, gift, or 
excise tax as the case may be) over the sum of the amount shown as such 
tax by the taxpayer upon his return and the amounts previously assessed 
(or collected without assessment) as a deficiency; but such sum shall 
first be reduced by the amount of rebates made. If no return is made, or 
if the return (except a return of income tax pursuant to sec. 6014) does 
not show any tax, for the purpose of the definition ``the amount shown 
as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return'' shall be considered as 
zero. Accordingly, in any such case, if no deficiencies with respect to 
the tax have been assessed, or collected without assessment, and no 
rebates with respect to the tax have been made, the deficiency is the 
amount of the income tax imposed by subtitle A, the estate tax imposed 
by chapter 11, the gift tax imposed by chapter 12, or any excise tax 
imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44. Any

[[Page 129]]

amount shown as additional tax on an ``amended return,'' so-called 
(other than amounts of additional tax which such return clearly 
indicates the taxpayer is protesting rather than admitting) filed after 
the due date of the return, shall be treated as an amount shown by the 
taxpayer ``upon his return'' for purposes of computing the amount of a 
deficiency.
    (b) For purposes of the definition, the income tax imposed by 
subtitle A and the income tax shown on the return shall both be 
determined without regard to the credit provided in section 31 for 
income tax withheld at the source and without regard to so much of the 
credit provided in section 32 for income taxes withheld at the source as 
exceeds 2 percent of the interest on tax-free covenant bonds described 
in section 1451. Payments on account of estimated income tax, like other 
payments of tax by the taxpayer, shall likewise be disregarded in the 
determination of a deficiency. Any credit resulting from the collection 
of amounts assessed under section 6851 or 6852 as the result of a 
termination assessment shall not be taken into account in determining a 
deficiency.
    (c) The computation by the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to 
section 6014, of the income tax imposed by subtitle A shall be 
considered as having been made by the taxpayer and the tax so computed 
shall be considered as the tax shown by the taxpayer upon his return.
    (d) If so much of the credit claimed on the return for income taxes 
withheld at the source as exceeds 2 percent of the interest on tax-free 
convenant bonds is greater than the amount of such credit allowable, the 
unpaid portion of the tax attributable to such difference will be 
collected not as a deficiency but as an underpayment of the tax shown on 
the return.
    (e) This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. The amount of income tax shown by the taxpayer upon his 
return for the calendar year 1954 was $1,600. The taxpayer had no 
amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a 
deficiency. He claimed a credit in the amount of $2,050 for tax withheld 
at source on wages under section 3402, and a refund of $450 (not a 
rebate under section 6211) was made to him as an overpayment of tax for 
the taxable year. It is later determined that the correct tax for the 
taxable year is $1,850. A deficiency of $250 is determined as follows:

Tax imposed by subtitle A.............................   $1,850         
Tax shown on return...................................   $1,600         
Tax previously assessed (or collected without                           
 assessment) as a deficiency..........................     None         
                                                       ---------        
    Total.............................................    1,600         
Amount of rebates made................................     None         
                                                       ---------        
Balance...............................................  .......   51,600
                                                                --------
Deficiency............................................  .......      250
                                                                        

    Example 2. The taxpayer made a return for the calendar year 1954 
showing a tax of $1,250 before any credits for tax withheld at the 
source. He claimed a credit in the amount of $800 for tax withheld at 
source on wages under section 3402 and $60 for tax paid at source under 
section 1451 upon interest on bonds containing a tax-free covenant. The 
taxpayer had no amounts previously assessed (or collected without 
assessment) as a deficiency. The district director determines that the 2 
percent tax paid at the source on tax-free covenant bonds is $40 instead 
of $60 as claimed by the taxpayer and that the tax imposed by subtitle A 
is $1,360 (total tax $1,400 less $40 paid at source on tax-free covenant 
bonds). A deficiency in the amount of $170 is determined as follows:

Tax imposed by subtitle A ($1,400 minus $40)...................   $1,360
Tax shown on return ($1,250 minus $60)................   $1,190         
Tax previously assessed (or collected without                           
 assessment) as a deficiency..........................     None         
                                                       ---------        
    Total.............................................    1,190         
Amount of rebates made................................     None         
                                                       ---------        
Balance...............................................  .......    1,190
                                                                --------
Deficiency............................................  .......      170
                                                                        

    (f) As used in section 6211, the term rebate means so much of an 
abatement, credit, refund, or other repayment as is made on the ground 
that the income tax imposed by subtitle A, the estate tax imposed by 
chapter 11, the gift tax imposed by chapter 12, or the excise tax 
imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44, is less than the excess of (1) the 
amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon the return increased by the 
amount previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a 
deficiency over (2) the amount of rebates previously made. For example, 
assume that the amount of income tax shown by the taxpayer upon his 
return for the taxable year is $600 and the amount claimed as a credit 
under section 31 for income tax withheld at the source is

[[Page 130]]

$900. If the district director determines that the tax imposed by 
subtitle A is $600 and makes a refund of $300, no part of such refund 
constitutes a ``rebate'' since the refund is not made on the ground that 
the tax imposed by subtitle A is less than the tax shown on the return. 
If, however, the district director determines that the tax imposed by 
subtitle A is $500 and refunds $400, the amount of $100 of such refund 
would constitute a rebate since it is made on the ground that the tax 
imposed by subtitle A ($500) is less than the tax shown on the return 
($600). The amount of such rebate ($100) would be taken into account in 
arriving at the amount of any deficiency subsequently determined.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6212-1   Notice of deficiency.

    (a) General rule.If a district director or director of a service 
center (or regional director of appeals), determines that there is a 
deficiency in respect of income, estate, or gift tax imposed by subtitle 
A or B, or excise tax imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44, of the Code, 
such official is authorized to notify the taxpayer of the deficiency by 
either registered or certified mail.
    (b) Address for notice of deficiency--(1) Income, gift, and chapter 
41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes. Unless the district director for the district 
in which the return in question was filed has been notified under the 
provisions of section 6903 as to the existence of a fiduciary 
relationship, notice of a deficiency in respect of income tax, gift tax, 
or tax imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 shall be sufficient if 
mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address, even though such 
taxpayer is deceased, or is under a legal disability, or, in the case of 
a corporation, has terminated its existence.
    (2) Joint income tax returns. If a joint income tax return has been 
filed by husband and wife, the district director (or assistant regional 
commissioner, appellate) may, unless the district director for the 
district in which such joint return was filed has been notified by 
either spouse that a separate residence has been established, send 
either a joint or separate notice of deficiency to the taxpayers at 
their last known address. If, however, the proper district director has 
been so notified, a separate notice of deficiency that is a duplicate 
original of the joint notice, must be sent by registered mail prior to 
September 3, 1958, and by either registered or certified mail on and 
after September 3, 1958, to each spouse at his or her last known 
address. The notice of separate residences should be addressed to the 
district director for the district in which the joint return was filed.
    (3) Estate tax. In the absence of notice, under the provisions of 
section 6903 as to the existence of a fiduciary relationship, to the 
district director for the district in which the estate tax return was 
filed, notice of a deficiency in respect of the estate tax imposed by 
chapter 11, subtitle B, of the Code shall be sufficient if addressed in 
the name of the decedent or other person subject to liability and mailed 
to his last known address.
    (c) Further deficiency letters restricted. If the district director 
or director of a service center (or regional director of appeals) mails 
to the taxpayer notice of a deficiency, and the taxpayer files a 
petition with the Tax Court within the prescribed period, no additional 
deficiency may be determined with respect to income tax for the same 
taxable year, gift tax for the same ``calendar period'' (as defined in 
Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)), estate tax with respect to the taxable estate of 
the same decedent, chapter 41, 43, or 44 tax of the taxpayer for the 
same taxable year, section 4940 tax for the same taxable year, or 
chapter 42 tax of the taxpayer (other than under section 4940) with 
respect to the same act (or failure to act) to which such petition 
relates. This restriction shall not apply in the case of fraud, 
assertion of deficiencies with respect to any qualified tax (as defined 
in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6361-4) in respect of which no deficiency 
was asserted for the taxable year in the notice, assertion of 
deficiencies with respect to the Federal tax when deficiencies with 
respect to only a qualified tax (and not the Federal tax) were asserted 
for the taxable year

in the notice, assertion of greater deficiencies before the Tax Court as 
provided in section 6214(a), mathematical errors as provided in section 
6213(b)(1), termination assessments in section 6851 or 6852, or jeopardy 
assessments as provided in section 6861(c). Solely for purposes of 
applying the restriction of section 6212(c), a notice of deficiency with 
respect to second tier tax under chapter 43 shall be deemed to be a 
notice of deficiency for the taxable year in which the taxable event 
occurs. See Sec. 53.4963-1(e)(7)(iii) or (iv) for the date on which the 
taxable event occurs.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6213-1   Restrictions applicable to deficiencies; petition to Tax Court.

    (a) Time for filing petition and restrictions on assessment--(1) 
Time for filing petition. Within 90 days after notice of the deficiency 
is mailed (or within 150 days after mailing in the case of such notice 
addressed to a person outside the States of the Union and the District 
of Columbia), as provided in section 6212, a petition may be filed with 
the Tax Court of the United States for a redetermination of the 
deficiency. In determining such 90-day or 150-day period, Saturday, 
Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia is not counted as 
the 90th or 150th day. In determining the time for filing a petition 
with the Tax Court in the case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a 
resident of Alaska prior to 12:01 p.m., e.s.t., January 3, 1959, and in 
the case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a resident of Hawaii prior 
to 4 p.m., e.d.s.t., August 21, 1959, the term ``States of the Union'' 
does not include Alaska or Hawaii, respectively, and the 150-day period 
applies. In determining the time within which a petition to the Tax 
Court may be filed in the case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a 
resident of Alaska after 12:01 p.m., e.s.t., January 3, 1959, and in the 
case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a resident of Hawaii after 4 
p.m., e.d.s.t., August 21, 1959, the term ``States of the Union'' 
includes Alaska and Hawaii, respectively, and the 90-day period applies.
    (2) Restrictions on assessment. Except as otherwise provided by this 
section, by sections 6851, 6852, and 6861(a) (relating to termination 
and jeopardy assessments), by section 6871(a) (relating to immediate 
assessment of claims for income, estate, and gift taxes in bankruptcy 
and receivership cases), or by section 7485 (in case taxpayer petitions 
for a review of a Tax Court decision without filing bond), no assessment 
of a deficiency in respect of a tax imposed by subtitle A or B or 
chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 of the Code and no levy or proceeding in court 
for its collection shall be made until notice of deficiency has been 
mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of the 90-day or 150-
day period within which a petition may be filed with the Tax Court, nor, 
if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of 
the Tax Court has become final. As to the date on which a decision of 
the Tax court becomes final, see section 7481. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of section 7421(a), the making of an assessment or the 
beginning of a proceeding or levy which is forbidden by this paragraph 
may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court. In any case where 
the running of the time prescribed for filing a petition in the Tax 
Court with respect to a tax imposed by chapter 42 or 43 is suspended 
under section 6213(e), no assessment of a deficiency in respect of such 
tax shall be made until expiration of the entire period for filing the 
petition.
    (b) Exceptions to restrictions on assessment of deficiencies--(1) 
Mathematical errors. If a taxpayer is notified of an additional amount 
of tax due on account of a mathematical error appearing upon the return, 
such notice is not deemed a notice of deficiency, and the taxpayer has 
no right to file a petition with the Tax Court upon the basis of such 
notice, nor is the assessment of such additional amount prohibited by 
section 6213(a).
    (2) Tentative carryback adjustments. (i) If the district director or 
the director of the regional service center determines that any amount 
applied, credited, or refunded under section 6411(b) with respect to an 
application for a tentative carryback adjustment is in

[[Page 132]]

excess of the overassessment properly attributable to the carryback upon 
which such application was based, the district director or the director 
of the regional service center may assess the amount of the excess as a 
deficiency as if such deficiency were due to a mathematical error 
appearing on the return. That is, the district director or the director 
of the regional service center may assess an amount equal to the excess, 
and such amount may be collected, without regard to the restrictions on 
assessment and collection imposed by section 6213(a). Thus, the district 
director or the director of the regional service center may assess such 
amount without regard to whether the taxpayer has been mailed a prior 
notice of deficiency. Either before or after assessing such an amount, 
the district director or the director of the regional service center 
will notify the taxpayer that such assessment has been or will be made. 
Such notice will not constitute a notice of deficiency, and the taxpayer 
may not file a petition with the Tax Court of the United States based on 
such notice. However, the taxpayer, within the applicable period of 
limitation, may file a regular claim for credit or refund based on the 
carryback, if he has not already filed such a claim, and may maintain a 
suit based on such claim if it is disallowed or if it is not acted upon 
by the Internal Revenue Service within 6 months from the date the claim 
was filed.
    (ii) The method provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to 
recover any amount applied, credited, or refunded in respect of an 
application for a tentative carryback adjustment which should not have 
been so applied, credited, or refunded is not an exclusive method. Two 
other methods are available to recover such amount: (a) By way of a 
deficiency notice under section 6212; or (b) by a suit to recover an 
erroneous refund under section 7405. Any one or more of the three 
available methods may be used to recover any amount which was improperly 
applied, credited, or refunded in respect of an application for a 
tentative carryback adjustment.
    (3) Assessment of amount paid. Any payment made after the mailing of 
a notice of deficiency which is made by the taxpayer as a payment with 
respect to the proposed deficiency may be assessed without regard to the 
restrictions on assessment and collection imposed by section 6213(a) 
even though the taxpayer has not filed a waiver of restrictions on 
assessment as provided in section 6213(d). A payment of all or part of 
the deficiency asserted in the notice together with the assessment of 
the amount so paid will not affect the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. If 
any payment is made before the mailing of a notice of deficiency, the 
district director or the director of the regional service center is not 
prohibited by section 6213(a) from assessing such amount, and such 
amount may be assessed if such action is deemed to be proper. If such 
amount is assessed, the assessment is taken into account in determining 
whether or not there is a deficiency for which a notice of deficiency 
must be issued. Thus, if such a payment satisfies the taxpayer's tax 
liability, no notice of deficiency will be mailed and the Tax Court will 
have no jurisdiction over the matter. In any case in which there is a 
controversy as to the correct amount of the tax liability, the 
assessment of any amount pursuant to the provisions of section 
6213(b)(3) shall in no way be considered to be the acceptance of an 
offer by the taxpayer to settle such controversy.
    (4) Jeopardy. If the district director believes that the assessment 
or collection of a deficiency will be jeopardized by delay, such 
deficiency shall be assessed immediately, as provided in section 
6861(a).
    (c) Failure to file petition. If no petition is filed with the Tax 
Court within the period prescribed in section 6213(a), the district 
director or the director of the regional service center shall assess the 
amount determined as the deficiency and of which the taxpayer was 
notified by registered or certified mail and the taxpayer shall pay the 
same upon notice and demand therefor. In such case the district director 
will not be precluded from determining a further deficiency and 
notifying the taxpayer thereof by registered or certified mail. If a 
petition is filed with the Tax Court the taxpayer should notify the 
district director who issued the notice of deficiency that the petition 
has been

[[Page 133]]

filed in order to prevent an assessment of the amount determined to be 
the deficiency.
    (d) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer may at any time by a signed 
notice in writing filed with the district director waive the 
restrictions on the assessment and collection of the whole or any part 
of the deficiency. The notice must in all cases be filed with the 
district director or other authorized official under whose jurisdiction 
the audit or other consideration of the return in question is being 
conducted. The filing of such notice with the Tax Court does not 
constitute filing with the district director within the meaning of the 
Code. After such waiver has been acted upon by the district director and 
the assessment has been made in accordance with its terms, the waiver 
cannot be withdrawn.
    (e) Suspension of filing period for certain chapter 42 and chapter 
43 taxes. The period prescribed by section 6213(a) for filing a petition 
in the Tax Court with respect to the taxes imposed by section 4941,4942, 
4943, 4944, 4945, 4951, 4952, 4955, 4971, or 4975, shall be suspended 
for any other period which the Commissioner has allowed for making 
correction under Sec. 53.4963-1(e)(3). Where the time for filing a 
petition with the Tax Court has been suspended under the authority of 
this paragraph (e), the extension shall not be reduced as a result of 
the correction being made prior to expiration of the period allowed for 
making correction.

Sec. 301.6215-1   Assessment of deficiency found by Tax Court.

    Where a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, the entire 
amount redetermined as the deficiency by the decision of the Tax Court 
which has become final shall be assessed by the district director or the 
director of the regional service center and the unpaid portion of the 
amount so assessed shall be paid by the taxpayer upon notice and demand 
therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6221-1T  Tax treatment determined at partnership level (temporary).

    (a) In general. A partner's treatment of partnership items on the 
partner's return may not be changed except as provided in sections 6222 
through 6231 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Thus, for 
example, if a partner treats an item on the partner's return 
consistently with the treatment of the item on the partnership return, 
the Internal Revenue Service generally cannot adjust the treatment of 
that item on the partner's return except through a partnership-level 
proceeding. Similarly, the taxpayer may not put partnership items in 
issue in a proceeding relating to nonpartnership items. For example, the 
taxpayer may not offset a potential increase in taxable income based on 
changes in nonpartnership items by a potential decrease based on 
partnership items.
    (b) Restrictions inapplicable after items become nonpartnership 
items. Section 6221 and paragraph (a) of this section cease to apply to 
items arising from a partnership with respect to a partner when those 
items cease to be partnership items with respect to that partner under 
section 6231 (b).
    (c) Cross reference. See   Secs. 301.6231(c)-1T and 301.6231(c)-2T 
for special rules relating to certain applications and claims for refund 
based on losses, deductions, or credits from abusive tax shelter 
partnerships.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6222(a)-1T  Consistent treatment of partnership items (temporary).

    (a) In general. The treatment of a partnership item on the partner's 
return shall be consistent with the treatment of that item by the 
partnership in all respects including the amount, timing, and 
characterization of the item.
    (b) Treatment must be consistent with partnership return. The 
treatment of a partnership item on the partner's return shall be 
consistent with the treatment of that item on the partnership return. 
Thus, a partner who treats an item consistently with a schedule or other 
information furnished to the partner by the partnership has not 
satisfied the requirement of paragraph (a)

[[Page 134]]

of this section if the treatment of that item is inconsistent with the 
treatment of the item on the partnership return actually filed. For 
rules relating to the election to be treated as having reported the 
inconsistency where the partner treats an item consistently with an 
incorrect schedule, see Sec. 301.6222(b)-3T.
    (c) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles set 
forth in this section.

    Example 1. B is a partner of Partnership P. Both B and P use the 
calendar year as the taxable year. In December 1983, P receives an 
advance payment for services to be performed in 1984 and reports this 
amount as income for calendar year 1983. However, B reports B's 
distributive share of this amount on B's income tax return for 1984 and 
not on B's return for 1983. B's treatment of this partnership item is 
inconsistent with the treatment of the item by P.
    Example 2. Partnership P incurred certain start-up costs before P 
was actively engaged in its business. P capitalized these costs. C, a 
partner in P, deducted C's proportionate share of these start-up costs. 
C's treatment of the partnership expenditure is inconsistent with the 
treatment of that item by P.
    Example 3. D is a partner in partnership P which reports a loss of 
$100,000 on its return, $5,000 of which it reports on the Schedule K-1 
attached to its return as D's distributive share. However, P reports 
$15,000 as D's distributive share of P's loss on the Schedule K-1 
furnished to D. D reports the $15,000 loss on D's income tax return. D 
has not satisfied the consistency requirement. See, however, 
Sec. 301.6222 (b)-3 for an election to be treated as having reported the 
inconsistency.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6222(a)-2T  Application of consistency and notification rules to indirect partners (temporary).

    (a) In general. The consistency requirement of Sec. 301.6222(a)-1T 
is generally applied with respect to the source partnership. For 
purposes of this section, the term ``source partnership'' means the 
partnership (within the meaning of section 6231(a)(1)) from which the 
partnership item originates.
    (b) Indirect partner files consistently with source partnership. An 
indirect partner who treats an item from a source partnership in a 
manner which is consistent with the treatment of that item on the return 
of the source partnership satisfies the consistency requirement of 
section 6222(a) regardless of whether the indirect partner treats that 
item in a manner which is consistent with the treatment of that item by 
the pass-thru partner through which the indirect partner holds the 
interest in the source partnerhip. Under these circumstances, therefore, 
the Service shall not send to the indirect partner the notice described 
in section 6231(b)(1)(A).
    (c) Indirect partner files inconsistently with source partnership--
(1) Indirect partner notifies Service of inconsistency. An indirect 
partner who--
    (i) Treats an item from a source partnership in a manner which is 
inconsistent with the treatment of that item on the return of the source 
partnership, and
    (ii) Files a statement identifying the inconsistency with the source 
partnership in accordance with Sec. 301.6222(b)-1T,
shall not be subject to a computational adjustment to conform the 
treatment of that item to the treatment of that item on the return of 
the source partnership.
    (2) Indirect partner does not notify Service of inconsistency. 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an indirect 
partner who--
    (i) Treats an item from a source partnership in a manner which is 
inconsistent with the treatment of that item on the return of the source 
partnership, and
    (ii) Fails to file a statement identifying the inconsistency with 
the source partnership in accordance with Sec. 301.6222(b)-1T,
is subject to a computational adjustment to conform the treatment of 
that item to the treatment of that item on the return of the source 
partnership.
    (3) Indirect partner files consistently with a pass-thru partner 
that notifies the Service of the inconsistency. If an indirect partner 
treats an item from a source partnership in a manner which is consistent 
with the treatment of that item by a pass-thru partner through which the 
indirect partner holds the interest in the source partnership and that 
pass-thru partner--
    (i) Treats that item in a manner that is inconsistent with the 
treatment of that item on the return of the source partnership, and

[[Page 135]]

    (ii) Files a statement identifying the inconsistency with the source 
partnership in accordance with Sec. 301.6222(b)-1T,
The indirect partner is not subject to a computational adjustment to 
conform the treatment of that item to the treatment of that item on the 
return of the source partnership.
    (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles set 
forth in this section.

    Example 1. One of the partners in Partnership A is Partnership B, 
which has four equal partners C, D, E, and F. Both A and B are 
partnerships within the meaning of section 6231(a)(1). On its return, A 
reports $100,000 as B's distributive share of A's ordinary income. B, 
however, reports only $80,000 as its distributive share of the income 
and does not notify the Service of this inconsistent treatment with 
respect to A. C reports $20,000 as its distributive share of the item. 
Although C reports the item consistently with B, C is subject to a 
computational adjustment to conform the treatment of that item on C's 
return to the treatment of that item on the return of A.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that B 
notified the Service of its inconsistent treatment with respect to 
source partnership A. C is not subject to a computational adjustment.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 1. D reports only 
$15,000 as D's distributive share of the income and does not report the 
inconsistency. F reports only $9,000 as its distributive share of the 
item but reports this inconsistency with respect to source partnership 
A. D is subject to a computational adjustment to conform the treatment 
of that item on D's return to the treatment of that item on the return 
of A. F is not subject to a computational adjsutment.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3 except that F 
reported the inconsistency with respect to B and did not report the 
inconsistency with respect to source partnership A. F is subject to a 
computational adjustment to conform the treatment of that item on F's 
return to the treatment of that item on the return of A.
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in example 1. E reports $25,000 
as its distributive share of the item. Regardless of whether E reports 
the inconsistency between its treatment of the item and that by B, E is 
neither subject to a computational adjustment to conform E's treatment 
of that item to that of B nor subject to the notice described in section 
6231(b)(1)(A) with respect to any such notification of inconsistent 
treatment.

Sec. 301.6222(b)-1T  Notification to Service when partnership items are treated inconsistently (temporary).

    The statement identifying an inconsistency described in section 
6222(b)(1)(B) shall be filed by filing the form prescribed for that 
purpose in accordance with the instructions accompanying that form.

[T.D. 8128, 52 FR 6782, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6222(b)-2T  Effect of notification of inconsistent treatment (temporary).

    (a) In general. Generally, if a partner treats a partnership item on 
the partner's return in a manner which is inconsistent with the 
treatment of that item on the partnership return the Service may make a 
computational adjustment to conform the treatment of the item by the 
partner with the treatment of that item on the partnership return. Any 
additional tax resulting from that computational adjustment may be 
assessed without either the commencement of a partnership proceeding or 
notification to the partner that all partnership items arising from that 
partnership will be treated as nonpartnership items. However, if a 
partner notifies the Service of the inconsistent treatment of a 
partnership item in the manner prescribed in Sec. 301.6222(b)-1T, the 
Service generally may not make an adjustment with respect to that 
partnership item unless the Service--
    (1) Conducts a partnership-level proceeding, or
    (2) Notifies the partner under section 6231(b)(1)(A) that all 
partnership items arising from that partnership will be treated as 
nonpartnership items.

See, however, Secs. 301.6231(c)-1T and 301.6231(c)-2T for special rules 
relating to certain applications and claims for refund based on losses, 
deductions, or credits from abusive tax shelter partnerships.
    (b) Partner protected only to extent of notification. A partner who 
reports the inconsistent treatment of partnership items on the partner's 
return is protected from computational adjustments under section 6222(c) 
only with respect to those partnership items the

[[Page 136]]

inconsistent treatment of which is reported. Thus, if a partner 
notifying the Service with respect to one item fails to report the 
inconsistent treatment of another item, the partner is subject to a 
computational adjustment with respect to that latter item.

    Example. Partner A of Partnership P treats a deduction and a capital 
gain arising from P on A's return in a manner that is inconsistent with 
the treatment of those items by P. A reports the inconsistent treatment 
of the deduction but not of the gain. A is subject to a computational 
adjustment under section 6222(c) with respect to the gain.

    (c) Adjustments in a separate proceeding not limited to conforming 
adjustments. If the Service conducts a separate proceeding with a 
partner whose partnership items are treated as nonpartnership items 
under section 6231 (b), the Service is not limited to making adjustments 
that merely conform the partner's return to the partnership return.

    Example. Partnership P allocates to E, one of its partners, a loss 
of $8,000. E, however, claims a loss of $9,000 and reports the 
inconsistent treatment. The Service notifies E that it will treat all of 
E's partnership items arising from P as nonpartnership items. As a 
result of a separate proceeding with E, the Service may issue a 
deficiency notice which could include reducing the loss to $3,000.

Sec. 301.6222(b)-3T  Partner receiving incorrect schedule (temporary).

    (a) In general. A partner shall be treated as having complied with 
section 6222(b)(1)(B) and Sec. 301.6222(b)-1T with respect to a 
partnership item if the partner--
    (1) Demonstrates that the treatment of the partnership item on the 
partner's return is consistent with the treatment of that item on the 
schedule prescribed by the Service and furnished to the partner by the 
partnership showing the partner's share of income, credits, deductions, 
etc., and
    (2) Elects in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph (b) 
of this section to have this section apply with respect to that item.
    (b) Election provisions--(1) Time and manner of making election. The 
election described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by 
filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office issuing the 
notice of computational adjustment within 30 days after the notice is 
mailed to the partner.
    (2) Contents of statement. The statement described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall be:
    (i) Clearly identified as an election under section 6222(b)(2),
    (ii) Signed by the partner making the election, and
    (iii) Accompanied by copies of the schedule furnished to the partner 
by the partnership and of the notice of computational adjustment. The 
partner need not enclose a copy of the notice of computational 
adjustment, however, if the partner clearly identifies the notice of 
computational adjustment.
Generally, the requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
will be satisfied by attaching to the statement a copy of the schedule 
furnished to the partner by the partnership. However, if it is not clear 
from the information contained on the schedule that the treatment of the 
partnership item on the schedule is consistent with the partner's 
treatment of such item on the partner's return the statement shall also 
include an explanation of how the treatment of such item on the schedule 
is consistent with the treatment on the partner's return with respect to 
the characterization, timing, and amount of such item.

Sec. 301.6223(a)-1T  Notice sent to tax matters partner (temporary).

    (a) In general. For purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the 
Code, a notice is treated as mailed to the tax matters partner on the 
earlier of--
    (1) The date on which the notice is mailed to ``THE TAX MATTERS 
PARTNER'' at the address of the partnership (as provided on the 
partnership return, except as updated under Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T), or
    (2) The date on which the notice is mailed to the person who is the 
tax matters partner at the address of that person (as provided on the 
partner's return, except as updated under Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T) or the 
partnership. See Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T for rules relating to the

[[Page 137]]

information to be used by the Service in providing notices, etc.
    (b) Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. Partnership P designates B as its tax matters partner in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6231(a)(7)-1T(b). On December 1 a notice of the 
beginning of an administrative proceeding is mailed to ``THE TAX MATTERS 
PARTNER'' at the address of P. On January 10, a copy of the notice is 
mailed to B at B's address. December 1 is treated as the date that the 
notice was mailed to the tax matters partner.

Sec. 301.6223(a)-2T  Withdrawal of notice of the beginning of an administrative proceeding (temporary).

    (a) In general. If the Internal Revenue Service, within 45 days 
after the day on which the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) is 
mailed to the tax matters partner, decides not to propose any 
adjustments to the partnership return as filed, the Service may withdraw 
the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) by mailing a letter to that 
effect to the tax matters partner within that 45-day period. If the 
Service withdraws the notice, neither the service nor the tax matters 
partner is required to furnish any notice with respect to that 
proceeding to any other partner. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, a notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) which has been 
withdrawn shall be treated for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of 
the Code as if that notice had never been mailed to the tax matters 
partner.
    (b) Service may not reissue notice except under certain 
circumstances. If the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) was mailed 
to the tax matters partner with respect to a partnership taxable year 
and that notice was later withdrawn as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Service shall not mail a second notice specified in section 
6223(a)(1) with respect to that taxable year unless:
    (1) There is evidence of fraud, malfeasance, collusion, concealment, 
or misrepresentation of a material fact;
    (2) The prior proceeding involved a clearly defined substantial 
error with respect to an established Service position existing at the 
time of the previous examination; or
    (3) Other circumstances exist which indicate that failure to reissue 
the notice would be a serious administrative omission.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6223(b)-1T  Notice group (temporary).

    (a) In general. If a group of partners having in the aggregate a 5 
percent or more interest in the profits of a partnership so requests and 
designates one of their members to receive the notices described in 
section 6223(a) (1) and (2), the member so designated shall be treated 
as a partner to whom section 6223(a) applies. Thus, the designated 
representative is entitled to receive any notice described in section 
6223(a) that is mailed to the tax matters partner 30 days or more after 
the day on which the Service receives the request from the group.
    (b) Request for notice--(1) In general. The Service shall mail to 
the member of the notice group designated to receive such notice any 
notice described in section 6223(a) that is mailed to the tax matters 
partner 30 days or more after the day on which the Service receives the 
request for notice from the group if such request for notice is made in 
accordance with the rules prescribed in this paragraph (b).
    (2) Content of request. The request for notice from a notice group 
shall--
    (i) Identify the partnership by name, address, and taxpayer 
identification number,
    (ii) Specify the taxable year or years for which the notice group is 
formed,
    (iii) Designate the member of the group to receive the notices,
    (iv) Set out the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and 
profits interest of each member of the group, and
    (v) Be signed by all partners comprising the notice group.
    (3) Place for filing. The request for notice from a notice group 
generally shall be filed with the service center with which the 
partnership return is filed. However, if the notice group representative 
knows that the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) (beginning of an 
administrative proceeding) has already

[[Page 138]]

been mailed to the tax matters partner, the statement shall be filed 
with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed that notice.
    (4) Copy to be sent to the tax matters partner. A copy of the 
request for notice from a notice group shall be provided to the tax 
matters partner by the notice group representative within 30 days after 
the request is filed with the Service.
    (5) Years covered by request. A request for notice by a notice group 
may relate only to partnership taxable years that have ended before the 
request is filed. A request, however, may relate to more than one 
partnership taxable year if the 5 percent or more profits interest 
requirement of section 6223(b)(2) is satisfied for each year to which 
the request relates.
    (c) Composition of notice group--(1) In general. A notice group 
shall be comprised only of persons who were partners at some time during 
the partnership taxable year for which the group is formed. If a notice 
group is formed for more than one taxable year, each member of the group 
must have been a partner at some time during at least one of the taxable 
years for which the group is formed. A notice group may include a 
partner entitled to separate notice. See section 6231(d) and 
Sec. 301.6231(d)-1T for rules relating to determining the interest of a 
partner in the profits of a partnership for a partnership taxable year 
for purposes of section 6223(b). See paragraph (c)(6) of this section 
for rules relating to indirect and pass-thru partners.
    (2) Partner may be a member of only one group. A partner cannot be a 
member of more than one notice group with respect to the same 
partnership for the same partnership taxable year. See paragraph (c)(6) 
of this section for rules relating to indirect and pass-thru partners.
    (3) Partner may join group after formation. A partner may join a 
notice group at any time after the formation of that group by filing 
with the Internal Revenue Service office with which the notice group 
filed its request a statement that it is joining the notice group. The 
statement shall identify the partner joining the notice group, the 
partnership, and the members of the notice group by name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number and shall be signed by the joining 
partner. A copy of the statement shall be provided by the joining 
partner to both the tax matters partner and the notice group 
representative within 30 days after the request is filed with the 
Service. The partner shall become a member of the notice group for each 
partnership taxable year for which the group was formed and for which 
the partner was a partner at any time during such partnership taxable 
year.
    (4) Date on which a partner becomes a member of notice group. A 
partner shall become a member of a notice group on the 30th day after 
the day on which the Service receives--
    (i) A request for notice from a notice group that identifies that 
partner as a member of that notice group, or
    (ii) A statement filed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section that states that the partner is joining the notice group.
    (5) No withdrawal from notice group. A partner who has signed a 
notice group request filed with the Service remains a member of that 
notice group until the group terminates. A partner cannot withdraw from 
the notice group.
    (6) Indirect and pass-thru partners--(i) Pass-thru partners and 
unidentified indirect partners. A pass-thru partner may become a member 
of a notice group as provided in this section. For purposes of applying 
the aggregate interest requirement specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section to a pass-thru partner, the partnership interest held by the 
pass-thru partner shall not include any interest held through the pass-
thru partner by an indirect partner that has been identified as provided 
in section 6223(c)(3) and Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T before the date on which 
the pass-thru partner becomes a member of the notice group.
    (ii) Indirect partners identified before the pass-thru partner joins 
a notice group. An indirect partner may become a member of a notice 
group with respect to a partnership taxable year only if:
    (A) The indirect partner held an interest in the partnership (either 
directly or through one or more pass-thru partners) at some time during 
that taxable year, and

[[Page 139]]

    (B) The indirect partner was identified as provided in section 
6223(c)(3) and Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T on or before the date on which the 
pass-thru partner became a member of a notice group.
    (d) Termination of notice group. Unless the original request for 
notice from the notice group or a subsequent statement filed by the 
representative (in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this 
section) designates a successor to the designated group representative, 
the group terminates if the representative dies (or, in the case of an 
entity, if the entity is dissolved), resigns, or is adjudicated 
incompetent.
    (e) Notice group is not a 5-percent group. The forming of a notice 
group under this section does not constitute the forming of a 5-percent 
group for purposes of litigation. A notice group is formed solely for 
the purpose of receiving notices. A 5-percent group is formed solely for 
the purpose of filing a petition for judicial review or appealing a 
judicial determination. See Sec. 301.6226(b)-1T. Thus, a member of a 
notice group may choose not to join a 5-percent group formed by other 
members of the notice group.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T  Additional information regarding partners furnished to the Service (temporary).

    (a) In general. In addition to the names, addresses, and profits 
interests as shown on the partnership return, the Service will use 
additional information as provided in this section for purposes of 
administering subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code.
    (b) Procedure for furnishing additional information--(1) In general. 
Any person may furnish additional information at any time by filing a 
written statement with the Service. However, the information contained 
in the statement will be considered for purposes of determining whether 
a partner is entitled to a notice described in section 6223(a) only if 
the Service receives the statement at least 30 days before the date on 
which the Service mails the notice to the tax matters partner. 
Similarly, information contained in the statement generally will not be 
taken into account for other purposes by the Service until 30 days after 
the statement is received.
    (2) Where statement must be filed. A statement furnished under this 
section shall generally be filed with the service center with which the 
partnership return is filed. However, if the person filing the statement 
knows that the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) (beginning of an 
administrative proceeding) has already been mailed to the tax matters 
partner, the statement shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service 
office that mailed such notice.
    (3) Contents of statement. The statement shall--
    (i) Identify the partnership, each partner for whom information is 
supplied, and the person supplying the information by name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number;
    (ii) Explain that the statement is furnished to correct or 
supplement earlier information with respect to the partners in the 
partnership;
    (iii) Specify the taxable year to which the information relates;
    (iv) Set out the corrected or additional information, and
    (v) Be signed by the person supplying the information.
    (c) No incorporation by reference to previously furnished documents. 
Incorporation by reference of information contained in another document 
previously furnished to the Internal Revenue Service will not be given 
effect for purposes of sections 6223(c) or 6229(e). For example, 
reference to a return filed by a pass-thru partner which contains 
identifying information with respect to the indirect partners of that 
pass-thru partner is not sufficient to identify the indirect partners 
unless a copy of the document referred to is attached to the statement.
    (d) Information supplied by a person other than the tax matters 
partner. The Service may require appropriate verification in the case of 
information furnished by a person other than the tax matters partner. 
The 30-day period referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall 
not begin until that verification is supplied.
    (e) Power of attorney--(1) In general. This paragraph (e) applies to 
powers of attorney with respect to proceedings under subchapter C of 
chapter 63 of the Code (``chapter 63C'') that begin on or after the date 
which is 90 days after the

[[Page 140]]

date final regulations under this section are published in the Federal 
Register. 
    (2) Specifically for purposes of chapter 63C. A power of attorney 
specifically for purposes of chapter 63C shall be furnished in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (3) Existing power of attorney. A power of attorney granted to 
another person by a partner for other tax purposes shall not be given 
effect for purposes of chapter 63C unless the partner specifically 
requests that the power be given such effect in a statement furnished to 
the Service in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Service may use other information. In addition to the 
information on the partnership return and that supplied on statements 
filed under this section, the Service may use other information in its 
possession (for example, a change in address reflected on a partner's 
return) in administering subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code. 
However, the Service is not obligated to search its records for 
information not expressly furnished under this section.

Sec. 301.6223(e)-1T  Effect of Service's failure to provide notice (temporary).

    (a) Notice group. Section 6223(e)(1)(B)(ii) applies with respect to 
a notice group only if the request for notice described in 
Sec. 301.6223(b)-1T is received by the Service at least 30 days before 
the notice is mailed to the tax matters partner.
    (b) Indirect partners--(1) In general. For purposes of section 
6223(e), the Service's failure to provide notice to a pass-thru partner 
that is entitled to notice under section 6223(b) is deemed failure to 
provide notice to indirect partners holding an interest in the 
partnership through the pass-thru partner. However, this rule does not 
apply if the indirect partner:
    (i) Receives notice from the Service,
    (ii) Is identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and 
Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T at least 30 days before the notice is mailed to the 
tax matters partner, or
    (iii) Is a member of a notice group entitled to notice under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Partnership ABC has as one of its partners, A, a 
partnership with three partners, X, Y, and Z. ABC does not have more 
than 100 partners, and partnership A is entitled to notice under section 
6223(a). In addition, Z was identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) 
and Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T on May 1, 1985. The Service mailed notice to the 
tax matters partner of ABC on July 1, 1985, but failed to provide notice 
to partnership A. Notwithstanding the Service's notice to the tax 
matters partner, the Service is deemed to have failed to provide notice 
to X and Y. The Service's failure to provide notice to A, however, has 
no effect on Z; whether notice was provided to Z is determined 
independently.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the 
Service provided notice to partnership A but did not provide separate 
notice to Z. Notwithstanding the Service's notice to partnership A, the 
Service is deemed to have failed to provide notice to Z.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that 
partnership ABC has more than 100 partners and partnership A is entitled 
to notice under section 6223(b) because it had at least a 1 percent 
profits interest in partnership ABC. In addition, X became a member of a 
notice group on June 1, 1985, and the Service mailed notice to the 
designated member of that notice group. The Service also mailed a 
separate notice to Z. The Service's failure to provide notice to 
partnership A only affects Y, who is deemed not to have been provided 
notice by the Service.

Sec. 301.6223(e)-2T  Elections if Service fails to provide timely notice (temporary).

    (a) Proceeding finished. If at the time the Internal Revenue Service 
mails the partner notice of the proceeding--
    (1) The period within which a petition for review of a final 
partnership administrative adjustment under section 6226 may be filed 
has expired and no petition has been filed, or
    (2) The decision of a court in an action begun by such a petition 
has become final, the partner may elect in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section to have that adjustment, that decision, or a settlement 
agreement described in section 6224(c)(2) with respect to the 
partnership taxable year to which the adjustment relates apply to that 
partner. If the partner does not

[[Page 141]]

make an election in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the 
partnership items of the partner for the partnership taxable year to 
which the proceeding relates shall be treated as having become 
nonpartnership items as of the day on which the Service mails the 
partner notice of the proceeding.
    (b) Proceeding still going on. If paragraph (a) of this section does 
not apply, the partner shall be a party to the proceeding unless the 
partner elects, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, to 
have--
    (1) A settlement agreement described in section 6224(c)(2) with 
respect to the partnership taxable year to which the proceeding relates 
apply to the partner, or
    (2) The partnership items of the partner for the partnership taxable 
year to which the proceeding relates treated as having become 
nonpartnership items as of the day on which the Service mails the 
partner notice of the proceeding.
    (c) Election--(1) In general. The election described in paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section shall be made in the manner prescribed in 
this paragraph (c). The election shall apply to all partnership items 
for the partnership taxable year to which the election relates.
    (2) Time and manner of making election. The election shall be made 
by filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office mailing 
the notice regarding the proceeding within 45 days after the date on 
which that notice was mailed.
    (3) Contents of statement. The statement shall--
    (i) Be clearly identified as an election under section 6223(e) (2) 
or (3),
    (ii) Specify the election being made (that is, application of final 
partnership administrative adjustment, court decision, consistent 
settlement agreement, or nonpartnership item treatment),
    (iii) Identify the partner making the election and the partnership 
by name, address, and taxpayer identification number,
    (iv) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the election 
relates, and
    (v) Be signed by the partner making the election.

Sec. 301.6223(f)-1T  Duplicate copy of final partnership administrative adjustment (temporary).

Sec. 301.6223(g)-1T  Responsibilities of the tax matters partner (temporary).

    (a) Notices described in section 6223 (a)--(1) Notice of beginning 
of proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 301.6223(a)-2T, the 
tax matters partner shall, within 75 days after the mailing by the 
Service of the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1), forward a copy of 
that notice to each partner that is not entitled to notice from the 
Service under section 6223. See Sec. 301.6230(e)-1T for information to 
be furnished to the Service.
    (2) Notice of final partnership administrative adjustment. The tax 
matters partner shall, within 60 days after the mailing by the Service 
of the notice specified in section 6223(a)(2), forward a copy of that 
notice to each partner that is not entitled to notice from the Service 
under section 6223.
    (3) Requirement inapplicable in certain cases. The tax matters 
partner is not required to send notice to a partner if--
    (i) Before the expiration of the applicable 75-day or 60-day period 
the partnership items of that partner have become nonpartnership items 
(for example, by settlement),
    (ii) That partner is an indirect partner and has not been identified 
to the tax matters partner at least 30 days before the tax matters 
partner is required to send such notice,
    (iii) That partner is treated as a partner solely by virtue of 
Sec. 301.6231(a)(2)-1T,
    (iv) That partner was a member of a notice group as of the date on 
which the notice was mailed to the tax matters partner (see 
Sec. 301.6223(b)-1T(c)(4) for the date on which a partner becomes a 
member of a notice group),
    (v) The notice has already been provided to that partner by another

this section information with respect to the following:
    (i) Closing conference with the examining agent,
    (ii) Proposed adjustments, rights of appeal, and requirements for 
filing of a protest,
    (iii) Time and place of any Appeals conference,
    (iv) Acceptance by the Service of any settlement offer,
    (v) Consent to the extension of the period of limitations with 
respect to all partners,
    (vi) Filing of a request for administrative adjustment (including a 
request for substituted return treatment under Sec. 301.6227(b)-2T) on 
behalf of the partnership,
    (vii) Filing by the tax matters partner or any other partner of any 
petition for judicial review under sections 6226 or 6228(a),
    (viii) Filing of any appeal with respect to any judicial

expiration of the period specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section

    (ii) Who are indirect partners and who are not identified to the tax 
matters partner at least 30 days before the tax matters partner is 
required to provide the information,
    (iii) Who are treated as partners solely by virtue of

    (v) Who have already received information with respect to the action 
or matter from any other person.
    (3) Time for furnishing information. The tax matters partner shall 
furnish information with respect to an action or other matter described

Internal Revenue Service, the tax matters partner, or another pass-thru 
partner, forward a copy of that notice or information to the person or 
persons holding an interest through the pass-thru partner in the profits

Sec. 301.6224(a)-1T  Participation in administrative proceedings (temporary).

    Every partner in the partnership, including an indirect partner, has 
the right to participate in any phase of administrative proceedings. 
However, except as provided in section 6223 and the regulations 
thereunder, neither the Service nor the tax matters partner is required 
to provide notice of any proceeding to partners. Consequently, a partner 
who wishes, for example, to be present during a preliminary discussion 
between an examining agent and the tax matters partner should make 
special arrangements with the tax matters partner to obtain information 
as to the time and place of the discussion. The Service and the tax 
matters partner will determine the time and place for all administrative 
proceedings. Arrangements will generally not be

[[Page 143]]

changed merely for the convenience of another partner.

Sec. 301.6224(b)-1T  Partner may waive rights (temporary).

    (a) In general. A partner may at any time waive any right that that 
partner has or any restriction on action by the Service under subchapter 
C of chapter 63 of the Code.
    (b) Form and manner of making waiver. The waiver described in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by a written statement. If 
the Service furnishes a form to be used for this purpose, the partner 
may make the waiver by completing the form in accordance with the 
instructions accompanying that form. If such a form is not furnished, 
the statement shall--
    (1) Be clearly identified as a waiver under section 6224(b),
    (2) Identify the partner and the partnership by name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number,
    (3) Specify the right or restriction being waived and the taxable 
year(s) to which the waiver applies,
    (4) Be signed by the partner making the waiver, and
    (5) Be filed with the service center with which the partnership 
return is filed. However, if the person filing the statement knows that 
the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) (beginning of an 
administrative proceeding) has already been mailed to the tax matters 
partner, the statement shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service 
office that mailed such notice.

Sec. 301.6224(c)-1T  Tax matters partner may bind nonnotice partners (temporary).

    (a) In general. In the absence of a showing of fraud, malfeasance, 
or misrepresentation of fact, if the tax matters partner enters into a 
settlement agreement with the Service and expressly states that that 
agreement shall be binding on the other partners, that agreement shall 
be binding on all partners except those who--
    (1) Are, as of the day on which the agreement is entered into, 
either notice partners or members of a notice group (see 
Sec. 301.6223(b)-1T(c)(4) for the date on which a partner becomes a 
member of a notice group), or
    (2) Have, at least 30 days before the day on which the agreement is 
entered into, filed with the Service the statement described in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Indirect partners--(1) In general. If, under paragraph (a) of 
this section, a pass-thru partner is not bound by an agreement entered 
into by the tax matters partner, all indirect partners holding an 
interest in the partnership through that pass-thru partner shall not be 
bound by that agreement. If, however, the pass-thru partner is bound by 
an agreement entered into by the tax matters partner, paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be applied separately to each indirect partner 
holding an interest in the partnership through the pass-thru partner to 
determine whether the indirect partner is also bound by the agreement.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principles set 
forth in this section.

    Example. Partnership P has over 100 partners. Partnership J is a 
partner in partnership P with a profits interest of less than 1 percent. 
Partnership J has three partners, A, B, and C. A is a member of a notice 
group with respect to partnership P, but B and C are not. On July 1, 
1985, B filed the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section 
not to be bound by any settlement agreement entered into by the tax 
matters partner of partnership P. On August 1, 1985, the tax matters 
partner of partnership P enters into a settlement agreement with the 
Service and states that the agreement is binding on other partners as 
provided in section 6224(c)(3). Since partnership J is bound by the 
settlement agreement, paragraph (a) of this section is applied 
separately to each of the indirect partners to determine whether they 
are bound. A is not bound by the agreement because he was a member of a 
notice group on the day the agreement was entered into and B is not 
bound because she filed the statement not to be bound at least 30 days 
before the agreement was entered into. C is bound by the settlement 
agreement.

    (c) Statement not to be bound--(1) Contents of statement. The 
statement referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall--
    (i) Be clearly identified as a statement to deny settlement 
authority to

[[Page 144]]

the tax matters partner under section 6224(c)(3)(B),
    (ii) Identify the partner and partnership by name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number,
    (iii) Specify the taxable year or years to which the statement 
applies, and
    (iv) Be signed by the partner filing the statement.
    (2) Place where statement is to be filed. The statement described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section generally shall be filed with the 
service center with which the partnership return is filed. However, if 
the partner knows that the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) 
(beginning of an administrative proceeding) has already been mailed to 
the tax matters partner, the statement shall be filed with the Internal 
Revenue Service office that mailed that notice.
    (3) Consolidated statements. The statement described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section may be filed with respect to more than one 
partner if the requirements of that paragraph (c)(1) (including 
signatures) are satisfied with respect to each partner.

Sec. 301.6224(c)-2T  Pass-thru partner binds indirect partners (temporary).

    (a) Pass-thru partner binds unidentified indirect partners--(1) In 
general. If a pass-thru partner enters into a settlement ageement with 
the Service with respect to partnership items, that agreement binds all 
indirect partners holding an interest in that partnership through the 
pass-thru partner except those indirect partners who have been 
identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T at 
least 30 days before the date on which the agreement is entered into. 
However, if, in addition to the interest in the partnership held through 
the pass-thru partner entering into a settlement agreement, an indirect 
partner holds a separate interest in that partnership, either directly 
or indirectly through a different pass-thru partner, the indirect 
partner shall not be bound by that settlement agreement with respect to 
the interests held directly or indirectly through a pass-thru partner 
other than the pass-thru partner entering into the settlement agreement.
    (2) Example. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. Partnership J is a partner in partnership P. C is a partner 
in J but has not been identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and 
Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T. The only interest that C holds in P is through J. 
The tax matters partner of J enters into a settlement agreement with the 
Service with respect to partnership items arising from P. C is bound by 
the settlement agreement entered into by the tax matters partner of J.

    (b) Person in pass-thru partner authorized to enter into settlement 
agreement that binds indirect partners. In the case of a pass-thru 
partner that is--
    (1) A partnership within the meaning of section 6231(a)(1), the tax 
matters partner of that partnership;
    (2) A partnership other than a partnership described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, any general partner of that partnership;
    (3) An S corporation subject to the provisions of subchapter D of 
chapter 63 of the Code, the tax matters person of that S corporation;
    (4) An S corporation other than an S corporation described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any officer of that S corporation; or
    (5) A trust, estate, or nominee, any person authorized in writing to 
act on behalf of that trust, estate, or nominee
may enter into a settlement agreement with the Service on behalf of its 
respective entity that would bind the unidentified indirect partners 
that hold a partnership interest through the pass-thru partner.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6224(c)-3T  Consistent settlements (temporary).

    (a) In general. If the Service enters into a settlement agreement 
with any partner with respect to partnership items, the Service shall 
offer to any other partner who so requests in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section settlement terms which are consistent with those 
contained in the settlement agreement entered into.
    (b) Requirements for consistent settlements. ``Consistent'' 
settlement terms

[[Page 145]]

are those based on the same determinations with respect to partnership 
items. Settlements with respect to partnership items shall be self-
contained; thus, a concession by one party with respect to a partnership 
item may not be based upon a concession by the other party with respect 
to a nonpartnership item. Settlements shall be comprehensive, that is, a 
settlement may not be limited to selected items. The requirement for 
consistent settlement terms applies only if--
    (1) The items were partnership items for the partner entering into 
the original settlement immediately before the original settlement, and
    (2) The items are partnership items for the partner requesting the 
consistent settlement at the time the partner files the request.
    (c) Time and manner of requesting consistent settlements--(1) In 
general. A partner desiring settlement terms consistent with the terms 
of any settlement agreement entered into between any other partner and 
the Service shall submit a written statement to the Internal Revenue 
Service office that entered into the settlement.
    (2) Contents of statement. Except as otherwise provided in 
instructions to the taxpayer from the Service, the written statement 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall--
    (i) Identify the statement as a request for consistent settlement 
terms under section 6224(c)(2),
    (ii) Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number 
of the partnership and of the partner requesting the settlement offer 
(and, in the case of an indirect partner, of the pass-thru partner 
through which the indirect partner holds an interest),
    (iii) Identify the earlier agreement to which the request refers, 
and
    (iv) Be signed by the partner making the request.
    (3) Time for filing request. The statement shall be filed not later 
than the later of--
    (i) The 150th day after the day on which the notice of final 
partnership administrative adjustment is mailed to the tax matters 
partner, or
    (ii) The 60th day after the day on which the settlement was entered 
into.
    (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles set 
out in this section.

    Example 1. The Service seeks to disallow a $100,000 loss reported by 
Partnership P. The Service agrees to a settlement with X, a partner in 
P, in which the Service allows 60 percent of the loss and accepts the 
treatment of all other partnership items on the partnership return. 
Partner Y, which owns a 10 percent interest in the partnership, requests 
settlement terms which are consistent with the settlement made between X 
and the Service. The items are partnership items for X immediately 
before X enters into the settlement agreement and partnership items for 
Y at the time of the request. The Service must offer Y a settlement 
agreement allowing a $6,000 loss and otherwise reflecting the treatment 
of partnership items on the partnership return.
    Example 2. F files inconsistently with partnership P and reports the 
inconsistency. The Service notifies F that it will treat all partnership 
items arising from P as nonpartnership items with respect to F. Later, 
the Service enters into a settlement with F on these items. The Service 
is not required to offer the other partners of P settlement terms 
consistent with the settlement reached between F and the Service because 
at the time of the settlement the items arising from P are no longer 
partnership items with respect to F.
    Example 3. G, a partner in Partnership P, filed suit under section 
6228(b) after the Service failed to allow an administrative adjustment 
request with respect to a partnership item arising from P for a taxable 
year. Under section 6231(b)(1)(B), the partnership items of G for the 
partnership taxable year became nonpartnership items as of the date the 
suit was filed. After G filed suit, another partner and the Service 
entered into a settlement agreement with respect to items arising from P 
in that year. G is not entitled to consistent settlement terms because 
the items arising from P are no longer partnership items with respect to 
G.

Sec. 301.6226(a)-1T  Principal place of business of partnership (temporary).

    (a) In general. The principal place of business of a partnership for 
purposes of determining the appropriate district court in which a 
petition for a readjustment of partnership items may be filed is its 
principal place of business as of the date the petition is filed.
    (b) Example. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following example:


[[Page 146]]


    Example. The principal place of business of partnership A on the day 
that the notice of the final partnership administrative adjustment was 
mailed to the tax matters partner of A was Cincinnati, Ohio. However, by 
the day on which a petition seeking judicial review of that adjustment 
was filed, A had moved its principal place of business to Louisville, 
Kentucky. For purposes of section 6226(a)(2), A's principal place of 
business is Louisville.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6226(b)-1T  5-percent group (temporary).

    All members of a 5-percent group shall join in filing any petition 
for judicial review. The designation of a partner as a representative of 
a notice group does not authorize that partner to file a petition for a 
readjustment of partnership items on behalf of the notice group.

[T.D. 8128, 52 FR 6788, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6226(e)-1T  Jurisdictional requirement for bringing an action in District Court or Claims Court (temporary).

    (a) Amount to be deposited--(1) In general. The jurisdictional 
amount that the filing partner (or, in the case of a petition filed by a 
5-percent group, each member of the group) shall deposit is the amount 
by which the tax liability of the partner would be increased if the 
treatment of the partnership items on the partner's return were made 
consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the partnership 
return, as adjusted by the notice of final partnership administrative 
adjustment. The partner is not required to pay other outstanding 
liabilities in order to deposit a jurisdictional amount.
    (2) Example. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. A files a petition for readjustment of partnership items in 
the Claims Court. A's tax liability would be increased by $4,000 if 
partnership items on his return were conformed to the partnership 
return, as adjusted by the notice of final partnership administrative 
adjustment. A has an unpaid liability of $10,000 attributable to 
nonpartnership items. A is required to deposit only $4,000 in order to 
satisfy the jurisdictional requirement.

    (b) Deposit taken into account in computing interest. The amount 
deposited is treated as a payment of tax for purposes of chapter 67 
(relating to interest). Thus, the period of deposit will be treated as a 
period of payment for purposes of determining the interest due on any 
overpayment or underpayment and computing any penalty under section 6653 
(a)(2) or (b)(2).
    (c) Deposit generally not treated as payment of tax. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an amount deposited under 
section 6226(e) shall not be treated as payment of tax. Thus, the 
Service may proceed against the depositor for a deficiency based on 
nonpartnership items without regard to this deposit.
    (d) Amount deposited may be applied against assessment. If the 
restriction on assessment provided under section 6225(a) lapses with 
respect to a deficiency attributable to partnership items for a 
partnership taxable year while an amount is on deposit under section 
6226(e) in connection with a petition relating to those items, the 
Service may apply the amount deposited against any such deficiency that 
is assessed.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6226(f)-1T  Scope of judicial review (temporary).

    (a) In general. A court reviewing a notice of final partnership 
administrative adjustment has jurisdiction to determine all partnership 
items for the taxable year to which the notice relates and the proper 
allocation of such items among the partners. Thus, the review is not 
limited to the items adjusted in the notice.
    (b) Example. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following example.

    Example. The Service issues a notice of final partnership 
administrative adjustment with respect to Partnership ABC in which the 
only item adjusted is depreciation. A petition for judicial review of 
that notice is filed. During the judicial proceeding, a partner of ABC, 
in accordance with the applicable court rules, raises an issue relating 
to the treatment of intangible drilling costs.

[[Page 147]]

The court reviewing the notice has jurisdiction to determine the 
intangible drilling cost issue as well as the depreciation issue.

Sec. 301.6227(b)-1T  Administrative adjustment request by the tax matters partner on behalf of the partnership (temporary).

    (a) In general. A request for an administrative adjustment filed by 
the tax matters partner on behalf of the partnership shall be filed on 
the form prescribed by the Service for that purpose in accordance with 
the instructions accompanying that form. Except as otherwise provided in 
the instructions accompanying that form, the request shall be--
    (1) Filed with the service center where the original partnership 
return was filed,
    (2) Signed by the tax matters partner, and
    (3) Accompanied by revised schedules showing the effects of the 
proposed changes on each partner and an explanation of the changes.
    (b) Denied request for treatment as a substituted return remains 
administrative adjustment request. An administrative adjustment request 
filed by the tax matters partner on behalf of the partnership for which 
substituted return treatment is requested but not granted remains an 
administrative adjustment request. Thus, for example, the tax matters 
partner may file suit under section 6228(a) if the Service fails to take 
timely action on the request.

Sec. 301.6227(c)-1T  Administrative adjustment request filed on behalf of a partner (temporary).

    A request for an administrative adjustment on behalf of a partner 
shall be filed on the form prescribed by the Service for that purpose in 
accordance with the instructions accompanying that form. Except as 
otherwise provided in the instructions accompanying that form, the 
request shall--
    (a) Be filed in duplicate, the original copy filed with the 
partner's amended income tax return (on which the partner computes the 
amount by which the partner's tax liability should be adjusted if the 
request is granted) and the other copy filed with the service center 
where the partnership return is filed,
    (b) Identify the partner and the partnership by name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number,
    (c) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the administrative 
adjustment request applies,
    (d) Relate only to partnership items, and
    (e) Relate only to one partnership and one partnership taxable year.

    Any partnership may authorize any person to extend the period 
described in section 6229(a) with respect to all partners by filing a 
statement to that effect with the service center with which the 
partnership return is filed. The statement shall--
    (a) Provide that it is an authorization for a person other than the 
tax matters partner to extend the assessment period with respect to all 
partners,
    (b) Identify the partnership and the person being authorized by 
name, address, and taxpayer identification number,
    (c) Specify the partnership taxable year or years for which the 
authorization is effective, and
    (d) Be signed by all persons who were general partners at any time 
during the year or years for which the authorization is effective.

    (a) In general. If a notice of the beginning of an administrative 
proceeding is mailed to the tax matters partner with respect to any 
partnership taxable year, the tax matters partner shall furnish to the 
Internal Revenue Service office that issued the notice the name, 
address, profits interest, and taxpayer identification number of each 
person who was a partner in the partnership at any time during that 
taxable year if that information was not provided on the partnership 
return filed for that year.
    (b) Revised or additional information. If the tax matters partner 
discovers that any information furnished to the Service on the 
partnership return or under paragraph (a) of this section was incorrect 
or incomplete, the tax matters partner shall furnish revised or 
additional information to the Service within 15 days of discovering that 
the information furnished to the Service was incorrect or incomplete.
    (c) Information required with respect to indirect partners. The 
requirements of this section for identifying information apply with 
respect to indirect partners to the extent that the tax matters partner 
has such information.

Sec. 301.6231(a)(1)-1T  Exception for small partnerships (temporary).

    (a) In general. For purposes of the exception for small partnerships 
under section 6231(a)(1)(B) the rules contained in this section shall 
apply.
    (1) ``10 or fewer.'' The ``10 or fewer'' limitation described in 
section 6231(a)(1)(B)(i)(I) is applied to the number of natural persons 
(other than nonresident aliens) and estates that were partners at any 
one time during the partnership taxable year. Thus, for example, a 
partnership that at no time during the taxable year had more than 10 
partners may be treated as a small partnership even if, because of 
transfers of interests in the partnership, 11 or more natural persons or 
estates owned interests in the partnership for some portion of the 
taxable year. For purposes of section 6231(a)(1)(B) and this section, a 
husband and wife (and their estates) are treated as one person.
    (2) Pass-thru partner. The exception provided in section 
6231(a)(1)(B) does not apply to a partnership for a taxable year if any 
partner in the partnership during that taxable year is a pass-thru 
partner. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), an estate shall not be 
treated as a pass-thru partner.
    (3) ``Same share.'' The requirement of section 6231(a)(1)(B)(i)(II) 
is satisfied for a taxable year if during all periods within that 
taxable year each partner's share of each of the partnership items 
specified in Sec. 301.6231(a)(3)-1(a)(1) (i) through (iv) is the same as 
that partner's share of each of the other partnership items specified in 
that section during that period (even though the partner's share of all 
such specified partnership items changes from period to period within 
that taxable year). Thus, a partner whose share of all such specified 
partnership items changes as a result of a sale or redemption of a

[[Page 149]]

partnership interest (or portion thereof) or a contribution of cash or 
property to the partnership during the partnership taxable year shall 
satisfy the same share requirement if during the period before the sale, 
redemption, or contribution the partner's share of each specified 
partnership item is the same as all other specified partnership items 
and during the period after the sale, redemption, or contribution the 
partner's share of each specified partnership item is the same as all 
other specified partnership items. For purposes of section 
6231(a)(1)(B)(i)(II) and this section, if each partner's share of each 
partnership item would be the same as his or her share of every other 
item but for allocations made under section 704 (c) or allocations made 
under similar principles in accordance with applicable regulations the 
requirement of section 6231(a)(1)(B)(i)(II) shall be considered 
satisfied. Similarly, special basis adjustments pursuant to sections 
754, 743, and 734 shall not be taken into account in determining whether 
the ``same share'' requirement is met.
    (4) Determination made annually. The determination of whether a 
partnership meets the requirements for the exception for small 
partnerships under section 6231(a)(1)(B) and this paragraph (a) shall be 
made with respect to each partnership taxable year. Thus, a partnership 
that does not qualify as a small partnership in one taxable year may 
qualify as a small partnership in another taxable year if the 
requirements for the exception under section 6231(a)(1)(B) and this 
paragraph (a) are met with respect to that other taxable year.
    (b) Election to have subchapter C of chapter 63 apply--(1) In 
general. Any partnership that meets the requirements set forth in 
section 6231(a)(1)(B) of the Code and paragraph (a) of this section 
(relating to the exception for small partnerships) may elect under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section to have the provisions of subchapter C 
of chapter 63 of the Code apply with respect to that partnership.
    (2) Method of election. A partnership shall make the election 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by attaching a statement 
to the partnership return for the first taxable year for which the 
election is to be effective. The statement shall be identified as an 
election under section 6231(a)(1)(B)(ii), shall be signed by all persons 
who were partners of that partnership at any time during the partnership 
taxable year to which the return relates, and shall be filed at the time 
(determined with regard to any extension of time for filing) and place 
prescribed for filing the partnership return. However, for partnership 
taxable years for which a partnership return is to be filed before 90 
days after the date final regulations under this section are published 
in the Federal Register the partnership may file the statement described 
in the preceding sentence on or before the date which is one year before 
the date specified in section 6229(a) for the expiration of the period 
of limitations with respect to that partnership (determined with regard 
to extensions of that period under section 6229(b)).
    (3) Years covered by election. The election shall be effective for 
the partnership taxable year to which the return relates and all 
subsequent partnership taxable years unless revoked with the consent of 
the Commissioner.

Sec. 301.6231(a)(2)-1T  Persons whose tax liability is determined indirectly by partnership items (temporary).

    (a) Spouse filing joint return with individual holding separate 
interest--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 
(a), a spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a 
separate interest in the partnership shall be treated as a partner for 
purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code. Thus, the spouse who 
files a joint return with a partner will be permitted to participate in 
administrative and judicial proceedings.
    (2) Counting rules. A spouse who files a joint return with an 
individual holding a separate interest in the partnership shall not be 
counted as a partner for purposes of applying section 6223(b) (relating 
to special rules for partnerships with more than 100 partners) and 
section 6231(a)(1)(B) (relating to the exception for small 
partnerships).

[[Page 150]]

    (3) Notice rules--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 
of the Code, a spouse who files a joint return with an individual 
holding a separate interest in the partnership shall be treated as 
receiving any notice received by the individual holding the separate 
interest.
    (ii) Spouse identified on partnership return or by statement. 
Paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to a spouse who 
files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in 
the partnership if that spouse:
    (A) Is identified on the partnership return; or
    (B) Is identified as a partner entitled to notice as provided in 
Sec. 301.6223(c)-1(b).
    (4) Cross-reference. See Sec. 301.6231(a)(12)-1T for special rules 
relating to spouses holding a joint interest in a partnership.
    (b) Shareholder of C corporation. A shareholder of a C corporation 
(as defined in section 1361(a)(2)) is not a partner in a partnership 
merely because the C corporation is a partner in that partnership.

Sec. 301.6231(a)(3)-1  Partnership items.

    (a) In general. For purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954, the following items which are required to be taken into 
account for the taxable year of a partnership under subtitle A of the 
Code are more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at 
the partner level and, therefore, are partnership items:
    (1) The partnership aggregate and each partner's share of each of 
the following:
    (i) Items of income, gain loss, deduction, or credit of the 
partnership;
    (ii) Expenditures by the partnership not deductible in computing its 
taxable income (for example, charitable contributions);
    (iii) Items of the partnership which may be tax preference items 
under section 57(a) for any partner;
    (iv) Income of the partnership exempt from tax;
    (v) Partnership liabilities (including determinations with respect 
to the amount of the liabilities, whether the liabilities are 
nonrecourse, and changes from the preceding taxable year); and
    (vi) Other amounts determinable at the partnership level with 
respect to partnership assets, investments, transactions and operations 
necessary to enable the partnership or the partners to determine--
    (A) The investment credit determined under section 46(a);
    (B) Recapture under section 47 of the investment credit;
    (C) Amounts at risk in any activity to which section 465 applies;
    (D) The depletion allowance under section 613A with respect to oil 
and gas wells; and
    (E) The application of section 751 (a) and (b);
    (2) Guaranteed payments;
    (3) Optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property 
pursuant to an election under section 754 (including necessary 
preliminary determinations, such as the determination of a transferee 
partner's basis in a partnership interest); and
    (4) Items relating to the following transactions, to the extent that 
a determination of such items can be made from determinations that the 
partnership is required to make with respect to an amount, the character 
of an amount, or the percentage interest of a partner in the 
partnership, for purposes of the partnership books and records or for 
purposes of furnishing information to a partner:
    (i) Contributions to the partnership;
    (ii) Distributions from the partnership; and
    (iii) Transactions to which section 707(a) applies (including the 
application of section 707(b)).
    (b) Factors that affect the determination of partnership items. The 
term ``partnership item'' includes the accounting practices and the 
legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of the 
amount, timing, and characterization of items of income, credit, gain, 
loss, deduction, etc. Examples of these determinations are: The 
partnership's method of accounting, taxable year, and inventory method; 
whether an election was made by the partnership; whether partnership 
property is a capital asset, section

[[Page 151]]

1231 property, or inventory; whether an item is currently deductible or 
must be capitalized; whether partnership activities have been engaged in 
with the intent to make a profit for purposes of section 183; and 
whether the partnership qualifies for the research and development 
credit under section 30.
    (c) Illustrations--(1) In general. This paragraph (c) illustrates 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The determinations 
illustrated in this paragraph (c) that the partnership is required to 
make are not exhaustive; there may be additional determinations that the 
partnership is required to make which relate to a transaction listed in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The critical element is that the 
partnership needs to make a determination with respect to a matter for 
the purposes stated; failure by the partnership actually to make a 
determination (for example, because it does not maintain proper books 
and records) does not prevent an item from being a partnership item.
    (2) Contributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for 
purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs 
to determine:
    (i) The character of the amount received from a partner (for 
example, whether it is a contribution, a loan, or a repayment of a 
loan);
    (ii) The amount of money contributed by a partner;
    (iii) The applicability of the investment company rules of section 
721(b) with respect to a contribution; and
    (iv) The basis to the partnership of contributed property (including 
necessary preliminary determinations, such as the partner's basis in the 
contributed property).

To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a contribution 
can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership 
is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the 
extent that that determination requires other information, however, that 
item is not a partnership item. For example, it may be necessary to 
determine whether contribution of the property causes recapture by the 
contributing partner of the investment credit under section 47 in 
certain circumstances in which that determination is irrelevant to the 
partnership.
    (3) Distributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for 
purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs 
to determine:
    (i) The character of the amount transferred to a partner (for 
example, whether it is a distribution, a loan, or a repayment of a 
loan);
    (ii) The amount of money distributed to a partner;
    (iii) The adjusted basis to the partnership of distributed property; 
and
    (iv) The character of partnership property (for example, whether an 
item is inventory or a capital asset).

To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a distribution 
can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership 
is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the 
extent that that determination requires other information, however, that 
item is not a partnership item. Such other information would include 
those factors used in determining the partner's basis for the 
partnership interest that are not themselves partnership items, such as 
the amount that the partner paid to acquire the partnership interest 
from a transferor partner if that transfer was not covered by an 
election under section 754.
    (4) Transactions to which section 707 (a) applies. For purposes of 
its books and records, the partnership needs to determine:
    (i) The amount transferred from the partnership to a partner or from 
a partner to the partnership in any transaction to which section 707(a) 
applies;
    (ii) The character of such an amount (for example, whether or not it 
is a loan; in the case of amounts paid over time for the purchase of an 
asset, what portion is interest); and
    (iii) The percentage of the capital interests and profits interests 
in the partnership owned by each partner.

To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a transaction 
to which section 707(a) applies can be made from these and similar 
determinations that the partnership is required to make, therefore, that 
item is

[[Page 152]]

a partnership item. To the extent that that determination requires other 
information, however, that item is not a partnership item. An example of 
such other information is the cost to the partner of goods sold to the 
partnership.
    (d) Effective date. This section shall apply with respect to 
partnership taxable years beginning after September 3, 1982. This 
section shall also apply with respect to any partnership taxable year 
ending after September 3, 1982, if with respect to that year there is an 
agreement entered into pursuant to section 407(a)(3) of the Tax Equity 
and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6231(a)(5)-1T  Definition of affected item (temporary).

    (a) In general. The term ``affected item'' includes items unrelated 
to the items reflected on the partnership return (for example, an item, 
such as the threshold for the medical expense deduction under section 
213, that varies if there is a change in an individual partner's 
adjusted gross income).
    (b) Partner's basis in his partnership interest. A partner's basis 
in his interest in the partnership is an affected item to the extent it 
is not a partnership item.
    (c) At-risk limitation. The application of the at-risk limitation 
under section 465 to a partner with respect to a loss flowing from a 
partnership is an affected item to the extent it is not a partnership 
item.
    (d) Addition to tax or additional amount--(1) In general. The term 
``affected item'' includes any addition to tax or additional amount 
provided by subchapter A of chapter 68 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954 to the extent provided in this paragraph (d).
    (2) Addition to tax or additional amount without floor. In the case 
where an addition to tax or additional amount that does not contain a 
floor (that is, a threshold amount of underpayment or understatement 
necessary before the imposition of the addition to tax or additional 
amount) is imposed on a partner as the result of an adjustment to a 
partnership item, the term ``affected item'' shall include the addition 
to tax or additional amount computed with reference to the entire 
underpayment or understatement.
    (3) Addition to tax or additional amount containing floor--(i) Floor 
exceeded prior to adjustment. In the case where a partner would have 
been subject to an addition to tax or additional amount that contains a 
floor in the absence of an adjustment to a partnership item (that is, 
the partner's understatement or underpayment exceeded the floor even 
without an adjustment to a partnership item) the term ``affected item'' 
shall include only the addition to tax or additional amount computed 
with reference to the partnership item (or affected item).
    (ii) Floor not exceeded prior to adjustment. In the case of an 
addition to tax or additional amount that contains a floor, if the 
taxpayer's understatement or underpayment does not exceed the floor 
prior to an adjustment to a partnership item but does so after such 
adjustment, the term ``affected item'' shall include the addition to tax 
or additional amount computed with reference to the entire underpayment 
or understatement.
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a partner of P, had an aggregate underpayment of $1000 
of which $100 is attributable to an adjustment to partnership items. A 
is negligent in reporting the partnership items. The addition to tax for 
negligence computed with reference to the entire $1000 underpayment is 
an affected item.
    Example 2. B, a partner in partnership P, understated his income tax 
liability attributable to nonpartnership items by $6,000. An adjustment 
to a partnership item resulting from a partnership proceeding increased 
B's income tax by an additional $2,000. Prior to the adjustment, B would 
have been subject to the addition to tax under section 6661 with respect 
to the $6,000 understatement. The addition to tax under section 6661 
computed with reference to the $2,000 increase is an affected item. The 
addition to tax computed with reference to the $6,000 pre-existing 
understatement is not an affected item.
    Example 3. C, a partner in partnership P, understated his income tax 
liability attributable to nonpartnership items by $4,000. As result of 
adjustment to partnership items, that understatement is increased to 
$10,000. Prior to the adjustment, C would not have been subject to any 
addition to tax under section 6661. The section 6661 addition to tax

[[Page 153]]

computed with reference to the entire $10,000 underpayment is an 
affected item.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6231(a)(6)-1T  Computational adjustments (temporary).

    (a) In general. A change in the tax liability of a partner to 
properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item under subchapter C 
of chapter 63 of the Code is made through a computational adjustment. A 
computational adjustment may include a change in tax liability that 
reflects a change in an affected item where that change is necessary to 
properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item. However, if a 
change in a partner's tax liability cannot be made without making one or 
more partner-level determinations, that portion of the change in tax 
liability attributable to the partner-level determinations shall be made 
under the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Code (relating 
to deficiency procedures). Thus, changes in a partner's tax liability 
with respect to affected items that do not require partner-level 
determinations (such as the threshold amount of medical deductions under 
section 213 that changes as the result of determinations made at the 
partnership level) are included in a computational adjustment. However, 
changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that 
require partner-level determinations (such as a partner's at-risk amount 
that depends upon the source from which the partner obtained the funds 
that the partner contributed to the partnership) are not included in a 
computational adjustment.
    (b) Interest. A computational adjustment includes any interest due 
with respect to any underpayment or overpayment of tax attributable to 
adjustments to reflect properly the treatment of partnership items.
    (c) Addition to tax or additional amount. A computational adjustment 
shall not include an addition to tax or additional amount. Regardless of 
whether an addition to tax or additional amount is an affected item 
within the meaning of section 6231(a)(5) and Sec. 301.6231(a)(5)-1T, the 
addition to tax or additional amount shall be subject to the provisions 
of subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Code (relating to deficiency 
procedures). See section 6229(a) for the period of limitations for 
making assessments with respect to affected items.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6231(a)(7)-1  Designation or selection of tax matters partner.

    (a) In general. A partnership may designate a partner as its tax 
matters partner for a specific taxable year only as provided in this 
section. Similarly, the designation of a partner as the tax matters 
partner for a specific taxable year may be terminated only as provided 
in this section. If a partnership does not designate a general partner 
as the tax matters partner for a specific taxable year, or if the 
designation is terminated without the partnership designating another 
general partner as the tax matters partner, the tax matters partner is 
the partner determined under this section.
    (b) Person who may be designated tax matters partner--(1) General 
requirement. A person may be designated as the tax matters partner of a 
partnership for a taxable year only if that person--
    (i) Was a general partner in the partnership at some time during the 
taxable year for which the designation is made; or
    (ii) Is a general partner in the partnership as of the time the 
designation is made.
    (2) Limitation on designation of tax matters partner who is not a 
United States person. If any United States person would be eligible 
under paragraph (a) of this section to be designated as the tax matters 
partner of a partnership for a taxable year, no person who is not a 
United States person may be designated as the tax matters partner of the 
partnership for that year without the consent of the Commissioner. For 
the definition of United States person, see section 7701(a)(30).
    (c) Designation of tax matters partner at time partnership return is 
filed. The partnership may designate a tax matters partner for a 
partnership taxable year on the partnership return for that taxable year 
in accordance with the instructions for that form.
    (d) Certification by current tax matters partner of selection of 
successor. If a

[[Page 154]]

partner properly designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership 
for a partnership taxable year under this section certifies that another 
partner has been selected as the tax matters partner of the partnership 
for that taxable year, that other partner is thereby designated as the 
tax matters partner for that year. The current tax matters partner shall 
make the certification by filing with the service center with which the 
partnership return is filed a statement that--
    (1) Identifies the partnership, the partner filing the statement, 
and the successor tax matters partner by name, address, and taxpayer 
identification number;
    (2) Specifies the partnership taxable year to which the designation 
relates;
    (3) Declares that the partner filing the statement has been properly 
designated as the tax matters partner of the partnership for the 
partnership taxable year and that that designation is in effect 
immediately before the filing of the statement;
    (4) Certifies that the other named partner has been selected as the 
tax matters partner of the partnership for that taxable year in 
accordance with the partnership's procedure for making that selection; 
and
    (5) Is signed by the partner filing the statement.
    (e) Designation by general partners with majority interest. The 
partnership may designate a tax matters partner for a partnership 
taxable year at any time after the filing of a partnership return for 
that taxable year by filing a statement with the service center with 
which the partnership return was filed. The statement shall--
    (1) Identify the partnership and the designated partner by name, 
address, and taxpayer identification number;
    (2) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the designation 
relates;
    (3) Declare that it is a designation of a tax matters partner for 
the taxable year specified; and
    (4) Be signed by persons who were general partners at the close of 
the year and were shown on the return for that year to hold more than 50 
percent of the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by all 
general partners as of the close of that taxable year. For purposes of 
this paragraph (e)(4), all limited partnership interests held by general 
partners shall be included in determining the aggregate interest in 
partnership profits held by such general partners.
    (f) Designation by partners with majority interest under certain 
circumstances--(1) In general. A tax matters partner may be designated 
for a partnership taxable year under this paragraph (f) only if, at the 
time the designation is made, each partner who was a general partner at 
the close of such partnership taxable year is described in one or more 
of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section as follows:
    (i) The general partner is dead, or, if the general partner is an 
entity, has been liquidated or dissolved;
    (ii) The general partner has been adjudicated by a court of 
competent jurisdiction to be no longer capable of managing his or her 
person or estate;
    (iii) The general partner's partnership items have become 
nonpartnership items under section 6231(b); or
    (iv) The general partner is no longer a partner in the partnership.
    (2) Method of making designation. A tax matters partner for a 
partnership taxable year may be designated under this paragraph (f) at 
any time after the filing of the partnership return for such taxable 
year by filing a written statement with the service center with which 
the partnership return was filed. The statement shall--
    (i) Identify the partnership and the designated tax matters partner 
by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
    (ii) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the designation 
relates;
    (iii) Declare that it is a designation of a tax matters partner for 
the partnership taxable year specified; and
    (iv) Be signed by persons who were partners at the close of such 
taxable year and were shown on the return for that year to hold more 
than 50 percent of the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by 
all partners as of the close of such taxable year.
    (g) Designation of alternate tax matters partner. If an individual 
is designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership under 
paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the document by

[[Page 155]]

which that individual is designated may also designate an alternate tax 
matters partner who will become tax matters partner upon the occurrence 
of one or more of the events described in paragraph (l)(1) (i) or (ii) 
of this section. The person designated as the alternate tax matters 
partner becomes the tax matters partner as of the time the designation 
of the tax matters partner is terminated under paragraph (l)(1) (i) or 
(ii) of this section. The designation of a person as the alternate tax 
matters partner shall have no effect in any other case.
    (h) Prior designations superseded. A designation of a tax matters 
partner for a partnership taxable year under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) 
of this section shall supersede all prior designations of a tax matters 
partner for that year, including a prior designation of an alternate tax 
matters partner under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (i) Resignation of designated tax matters partner. A person 
designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership under this 
section may resign at any time by a written statement to that effect. 
The statement shall specify the partnership taxable year to which the 
resignation relates and shall identify the partnership and the tax 
matters partner by name, address, and taxpayer identification number. 
The statement shall also be signed by the resigning tax matters partner 
and shall be filed with the service center with which the partnership 
return was filed.
    (j) Revocation of designation. The partnership may revoke the 
designation of the tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year at 
any time after the filing of a partnership return for that taxable year 
by filing a statement with the service center with which the partnership 
return was filed. The statement shall--
    (1) Identify by name, address, and taxpayer identification number 
the partnership and the general partner whose designation as tax matters 
partner is being revoked;
    (2) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the revocation 
relates;
    (3) Declare that it is a revocation of a designation of the tax 
matters partner for the taxable year specified; and
    (4) Be signed by the persons described in paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section, or, if at the time that the revocation is made, each partner 
who was a general partner at the close of the partnership taxable year 
to which the revocation relates is described in one or more of 
paragraphs (f)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section, by the persons 
described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (k) When designation, etc., becomes effective--(1) In general. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, a 
designation, resignation, or revocation provided for in this section 
becomes effective on the day that the statement required by the 
applicable paragraph of this section is filed.
    (2) Notice of proceeding mailed. If a notice of beginning of an 
administrative proceeding with respect to a partnership taxable year is 
mailed before the date on which a statement of designation, resignation, 
or revocation provided for in this section with respect to that taxable 
year is filed, the Service is not required to give effect to such 
designation, resignation, or revocation until 30 days after the 
statement is filed.
    (l) Termination of designation--(1) In general. A designation of a 
tax matters partner for a taxable year under this section shall remain 
in effect until--
    (i) The death of the designated tax matters partner;
    (ii) An adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that the 
individual designated as the tax matters partner is no longer capable of 
managing the individual's person or estate;
    (iii) The liquidation or dissolution of the tax matters partner, if 
the tax matters partner is an entity;
    (iv) The partnership items of the tax matters partner become 
nonpartnership items under section 6231(c) (relating to special 
enforcement areas); or
    (v) The day on which--
    (A) The resignation of the tax matters partner under paragraph (i) 
of this section;
    (B) A subsequent designation under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of 
this section; or
    (C) A revocation of the designation under paragraph (j) of this 
section becomes effective.

[[Page 156]]

    (2) Actions by the tax matters partner before termination of 
designation. The termination of the designation of a partner as the tax 
matters partner under paragraph (l)(1) of this section does not affect 
the validity of any action taken by that partner as tax matters partner 
before the designation is terminated. For example, if that tax matters 
partner had previously consented to an extension of the period for 
assessments under section 6229(b)(1)(B), that extension remains valid 
even after termination of the designation.
    (m) Tax matters partner where no partnership designation made--(1) 
In general. The tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year shall 
be determined under this paragraph (m) if--
    (i) The partnership has not designated a tax matters partner under 
this section for that taxable year; or
    (ii) The partnership has designated a tax matters partner under this 
section for that taxable year, that designation has been terminated 
under paragraph (l)(1) of this section, and the partnership has not made 
a subsequent designation under this section for that taxable year.
    (2) General partner having the largest profits interest is the tax 
matters partner. The tax matters partner for any partnership taxable 
year to which this paragraph (m) applies is the general partner having 
the largest profits interest in the partnership at the close of that 
taxable year (or where there is more than one such partner, the one of 
such partners whose name would appear first in an alphabetical listing). 
For purposes of this paragraph (m)(2), all limited partnership interests 
held by a general partner shall be included in determining that general 
partner's profits interest in the partnership. For purposes of this 
paragraph (m)(2), the general partner with the largest profits interest 
is determined based on the year-end profits interests reported on the 
Schedules K-1 filed with the partnership income tax return for the 
taxable year for which the determination is being made.
    (3) Termination of designation. A designation of a tax matters 
partner for a partnership taxable year under this paragraph (m) shall 
remain in effect until the earlier of the occurrence of one or more of 
the events described in paragraphs (l)(1) (i) through (iv) of this 
section or the day on which a designation under paragraph (d), (e), or 
(f) of this section becomes effective. If a designation of a tax matters 
partner for a partnership taxable year is terminated under this 
paragraph (m)(3) and the partnership has not subsequently designated a 
tax matters partner for that taxable year under paragraph (d), (e), or 
(f) of this section, the tax matters partner for that taxable year shall 
be determined under paragraph (m)(2) of this section, and, for purposes 
of applying paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the general partner whose 
designation was so terminated shall be treated as having no profits 
interest in the partnership for that taxable year.
    (n) Selection of tax matters partner by Commissioner when 
impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule. If the 
partnership has not designated a tax matters partner under this section 
for the taxable year and it is impracticable (as determined under 
paragraph (o) of this section) to apply the largest-profits-interest 
rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will select a 
tax matters partner as described in paragraph (p) of this section.
    (o) Impracticability of largest-profits-interest rule. It is 
impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section if, on the date the rule is applied, any one of 
the following three conditions is met:
    (1) General partner with the largest profits interest is not 
apparent. The general partner with the largest profits interest is not 
apparent from the Schedules K-1 and is not otherwise readily 
determinable.
    (2) Each general partner is deemed to have no profits interest in 
the partnership. Each general partner is deemed to have no profits 
interest in the partnership under paragraph (m)(3) of this section 
(concerning termination of a designation under the largest-profits-
interest rule) because of the occurrence of one or more of the events 
described in paragraphs (l)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section 
(involving death, adjudication of incompetency, liquidation, and 
conversion of partnership items to nonpartnership items).

[[Page 157]]

    (3) General partner with the largest profits interest is 
disqualified. The general partner with the largest profits interest 
determined under paragraph (m)(2) of this section--
    (i) Has been notified of suspension from practice before the 
Internal Revenue Service;
    (ii) Is incarcerated;
    (iii) Is residing outside the United States, its possessions, or 
territories; or
    (iv) Cannot be located or cannot perform the functions of a tax 
matters partner for any reason, except that lack of cooperation with the 
Internal Revenue Service by the general partner with the largest profits 
interest is not a basis for finding that the partner cannot perform the 
functions of a tax matters partner.
    (p) Commissioner's selection of the tax matters partner--(1) When 
the general partner with the largest profits interest is not apparent. 
If it is impracticable under paragraph (o)(1) of this section to apply 
the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section, 
the Commissioner will select (in accordance with the notification 
procedures set forth in paragraph (r) of this section) as the tax 
matters partner any person who was a general partner at any time during 
the taxable year under examination.
    (2) When each general partner is deemed to have no profits interest 
in the partnership. If it is impracticable under paragraph (o)(2) of 
this section to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will select a partner 
(including a general or limited partner) as the tax matters partner in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph (q) of this section. 
The Commissioner will notify both the partner selected and the 
partnership of the selection, effective as of the date specified in the 
notice.
    (3) When the general partner with the largest profits interest is 
disqualified--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(p)(3)(ii) of this section, if it is impracticable under paragraph 
(o)(3) of this section to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of 
paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will treat each 
general partner who fits the criteria contained in paragraph (o)(3) of 
this section as having no profits interest in the partnership for the 
taxable year and will select (in accordance with the notification 
procedures set forth in paragraph (r) of this section) a tax matters 
partner from the remaining persons who were general partners at any time 
during the taxable year.
    (ii) Partner selected if no general partner may be selected. If all 
general partners during the taxable year either are treated as having no 
profits interest in the partnership for the taxable year under paragraph 
(m)(3) of this section (concerning termination of a designation under 
the largest-profits-interest rule) or are described in paragraph (o)(3) 
of this section (general partner with the largest profits interest is 
disqualified), the Commissioner will select a partner (including a 
general or limited partner) as the tax matters partner in accordance 
with the criteria set forth in paragraph (q) of this section. The 
Commissioner will notify both the partner selected and the partnership 
of the selection, effective as of the date specified in the notice.
    (q) Criteria for selecting a partner as tax matters partner--(1) In 
general. The Commissioner will select a partner as the tax matters 
partner under paragraph (p) (2) or (3)(ii) of this section only if the 
partner was a partner in the partnership at the close of the taxable 
year under examination.
    (2) Criteria to be considered. The Commissioner may consider the 
following criteria in selecting a partner as the tax matters partner:
    (i) The general knowledge of the partner in tax matters and the 
administrative operation of the partnership.
    (ii) The partner's access to the books and records of the 
partnership.
    (iii) The profits interest held by the partner.
    (iv) The views of the partners having a majority interest in the 
partnership regarding the selection.
    (v) Whether the partner is a partner of the partnership at the time 
the tax-matters-partner selection is made.
    (vi) Whether the partner is a United States person (within the 
meaning of section 7701(a)(30)).

[[Page 158]]

    (3) Limited restriction on subsequent designation of a tax matters 
partner by the partnership. For purposes of paragraphs (p) (2) and 
(3)(ii) of this section, the partnership cannot designate a partner who 
is not a general partner to serve as tax matters partner in lieu of a 
partner selected by the Commissioner.
    (r) Notification of partnership--(1) In general. If the Commissioner 
selects a tax matters partner under the provisions of paragraph (p) (1) 
or (3)(i) of this section, the Commissioner will notify both the partner 
selected and the partnership of the selection, effective as of the date 
specified in the notice.
    (2) Limited opportunity for partnership to designate the tax matters 
partner. (i) Before the Commissioner selects a tax matters partner under 
paragraphs (p) (1) and (3)(i) of this section, the Commissioner will 
notify the partnership by mail that, after 30 days from the date of the 
notice, the Commissioner will make a determination that it is 
impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section and will select the tax matters partner unless a 
prior designation is made by the partnership. This delay in making the 
determination will permit the partnership to designate a tax matters 
partner under paragraph (e) of this section (designation by general 
partners with a majority interest) or paragraph (f) of this section 
(designation by partners with a majority interest under certain 
circumstances), thereby avoiding a selection made by the Commissioner.
    (ii) During the 30-day period and prior to a tax-matters-partner 
designation by the partnership, the Commissioner will communicate with 
the partnership by sending all correspondence or notices to ``The Tax 
Matters Partner'' in care of the partnership at the partnership's 
address.
    (iii) Any subsequent designation of a tax matters partner by the 
partnership after the 30-day period will become effective as provided 
under paragraph (k)(2) of this section (concerning designations made 
after a notice of beginning of administrative proceeding is mailed).
    (s) Effective date. This section applies to all designations, 
selections, and terminations of a tax matters partner occurring on or 
after December 23, 1996.

Sec. 301.6231(a)(7)-2  Designation or selection of tax matters partner for a limited liability company (LLC).

    (a) In general. Solely for purposes of applying section 6231(a)(7) 
and Sec. 301.6231(a)(7)-1 to an LLC, only a member-manager of an LLC is 
treated as a general partner, and a member of an LLC who is not a 
member-manager is treated as a partner other than a general partner.
    (b) Definitions--(1) LLC. Solely for purposes of this section, LLC 
means an organization--
    (i) Formed under a law that allows the limitation of the liability 
of all members for the organization's debts and other obligations within 
the meaning of Sec. 301.7701-3(b)(2)(ii); and
    (ii) Classified as a partnership for Federal tax purposes.
    (2) Member. Solely for purposes of this section, member means any 
person who owns an interest in an LLC.
    (3) Member-manager. Solely for purposes of this section, member-
manager means a member of an LLC who, alone or together with others, is 
vested with the continuing exclusive authority to make the management 
decisions necessary to conduct the business for which the organization 
was formed. Generally, an LLC statute may permit the LLC to choose 
management by one or more managers (whether or not members) or by all of 
the members. If there are no elected or designated member-managers (as 
so defined in this paragraph (b)(3)) of the LLC, each member will be 
treated as a member-manager for purposes of this section.
    (c) Effective date. This section applies to all designations, 
selections, and terminations of a tax matters partner of an LLC 
occurring on or after December 23, 1996. Any other reasonable 
designation or selection of a tax matters partner of an LLC is binding 
for periods prior to December 23, 1996.

Sec. 301.6231(a)(12)-1T  Special rules relating to spouses (temporary).

    (a) In general. For purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the 
Code, spouses holding a joint interest in a partnership are treated as 
partners. Thus, both spouses are permitted to participate in 
administrative and judicial proceedings. The term ``joint interest'' 
includes tenancies in common, joint tenancies, tenancies by the 
entirety, and community property.
    (b) Notice and counting rules--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for purposes of applying section 6223 
(relating to notice to partners of proceedings) and section 
6231(a)(1)(B) (relating to the exception for small partnerships), 
spouses holding a joint interest in a partnership shall be treated as 
one person. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
Service or the tax matters partner may send any required notice to 
either spouse.
    (2) Identified spouse entitled to notice. For purposes of applying 
section 6223 (relating to notice to partners of proceeding) for a 
partnership taxable year, an individual who holds a joint interest in a 
partnership with his or her spouse who is entitled to notice under 
section 6223 shall be entitled to receive separate notice under section 
6223 if such individual:
    (i) Is identified as a partner on the partnership return for that 
taxable year; or
    (ii) Is identified as a partner entitled to notice as provided in 
Sec. 301.6223(c)-1T (b).
    (c) Cross-reference. See Sec. 301.6231(a)(2)-1T(a) for special rules 
relating to spouses who file joint returns with individuals holding a 
separate interest in a partnership.

Sec. 301.6231(c)-1T  Special rules for certain applications for tentative carryback and refund adjustments based on partnership losses, deductions, or credits 
          (temporary).

    (a) Applications subject to this section. This section applies in 
the case of an application under section 6411 (relating to tentative 
carryback and refund adjustments) based on losses, deductions, or 
credits of a partnership if the Commissioner or his delegate determines, 
after review of the available relevant information, that it is highly 
likely that a person described in section 6700(a)(1) made, with respect 
to the partnership--
    (1) A gross valuation overstatement, or
    (2) A false or fraudulent statement with respect to the tax benefits 
to be secured by reason of holding an interest in the partnership, that 
would be subject to a penalty under section 6700 (relating to penalty 
for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.). This section applies only 
with respect to an application based upon the original reporting on the 
partner's income tax return of partnership losses, deductions, or 
credits. Thus, this section does not apply to a request for 
administrative adjustment under section 6227 through which a partner 
seeks to change the partner's reporting of partnership items on the 
partner's income tax return (or on an earlier request for administrative 
adjustment).
    (b) Determination of special enforcement area. In the case of an 
application under section 6411 described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, precluding an assessment under section 6225 that would be 
permitted under section 6213(b)(3) (relating to assessments arising out 
of tentative carry back or refund adjustments) with respect to any 
amount applied, credited, or refunded as a result of the application may 
encourage the proliferation of abusive tax shelter partnerships and make 
the eventual collection of taxes due more difficult. Consequently, the 
Commissioner hereby determines that such applications present special 
enforcement considerations within the meaning of section 6231(c)(1)(E).
    (c) Assessment permitted under section 6213(b)(3). Notwithstanding 
section 6225 (relating to restrictions on assessment with respect to 
partnership items), an assessment that would be permitted under section 
6213(b)(3) with respect to any amount applied, credited, or refunded as 
a result of an application described in paragraph (a) of this section 
may be made before there is a final partnership-level determination with 
respect to the losses, deductions, or credits on which the application 
is

[[Page 160]]

based. As provided in section 6213(b)(1), the Service shall mail notice 
of any such assessment to the partner filing the application. The notice 
shall also inform the partner of the partner's limited right to elect to 
treat items as nonpartnership items as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (d) Limited right to elect to treat items as nonpartnership items--
(1) In general. A partner to whom the Service mails notice of an 
assessment under paragraph (c) of this section may elect in accordance 
with this paragraph (d) to have all partnership items for the 
partnership taxable year in which the losses, deductions, or credits at 
issue arose treated as nonpartnership items.
    (2) Time and place of making election. The election shall be made by 
filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed 
the notice of assessment. The statement may be filed at any time--
    (i) After the date which is one year after the date on which the 
partnership return was filed for the partnership taxable year in which 
the items at issue arose, and
    (ii) Before the date on which the Service mails to the tax matters 
partner the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment for 
the partnership taxable year in which the items at issue arose.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), a partnership return filed before 
the last day prescribed by law for its filing (determined without regard 
to extensions) shall be treated as filed on that last day.
    (3) Contents of the statement. The statement shall--
    (i) Be clearly identified as an election to have partnership items 
treated as nonpartnership items because of notification of an assessment 
under section 6213(b)(3),
    (ii) Identify the partnership by name, address, and taxpayer 
identification number,
    (iii) Identify the partner making the election by name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number,
    (iv) Specify and partnership taxable year to which the election 
applies, and
    (v) Be signed by the partner making the election.
    (e) Effective date. This section applies with respect to any 
application described in paragraph (a) of this section that is filed 
after December 10, 1984.

(Secs. 6231 (c) (1) and (3), Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (96 Stat.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6231(c)-2T  Special rules for certain refund claims based on losses, deductions, or credits from abusive tax shelter partnerships (temporary).

    (a) Claims subject to this section. This section applies in the case 
of a claim for credit or refund based on losses, deductions or credits 
of a partnership if the Commissioner or his delegate determines, after 
review of available relevant information, that it is highly likely that 
a person described in section 6700(a)(1) made, with respect to the 
partnership--
    (1) A gross valuation overstatement, or
    (2) A false or fraudulent statement with respect to the tax benefits 
to be secured by reason of holding an interest in the partnership, that 
would be subject to a penalty under section 6700 (relating to penalty 
for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.). This section applies only 
with respect to a claim that is based upon the partner's original 
reporting on the partner's income tax return of partnership losses, 
deductions, or credits. Thus, this section does not apply to a request 
for administrative adjustment under section 6227 through which a partner 
seeks to change the partner's reporting of partnership items on the 
partner's income tax return (or on an earlier request for administrative 
adjustment). For purposes of this section, any income tax return 
requesting a credit or refund shall be treated as a claim for a credit 
or refund.
    (b) Determination of special enforcement area. Granting a claim for 
credit or refund described in paragraph (a) of this section may 
encourage the proliferation of abusive tax shelter partnerships and make 
the eventual collection of taxes due more difficult. Consequently, the 
Commissioner hereby determines that such claims present special 
enforcement considerations

[[Page 161]]

within the meaning of section 6231(c)(1)(E).
    (c) Action on refund claims suspended. In the case of a claim 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Service may mail to the 
partner filing the claim a notice stating that no action will be taken 
on the partner's claim until the completion of partnership-level 
proceedings. The notice shall also inform the partner of the partner's 
limited right to elect to treat items as nonpartnership items as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Limited right to elect to treat items as nonpartnership items--
(1) In general. A partner to whom the Service mails a notice of 
suspension of action on a refund claim under paragraph (c) of this 
section may elect in accordance with this paragraph (d) to have all 
partnership items for the partnership taxable year in which the losses, 
deductions, or credits at issue arose treated as nonpartnership items.
    (2) Time and place of making election. The election shall be made by 
filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed 
the notice of suspension. The statement may be filed at any time--
    (i) After the date which is one year after the date on which the 
partnership return was filed for the partnership taxable year in which 
the items at issue arose, and
    (ii) Before the date on which the Service mails to the tax matters 
partner the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment for 
the partnership taxable year in which the items at issue arose.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), a partnership return filed before 
the last day prescribed by law for its filing (determined without regard 
to extensions) shall be treated as filed on that last day.
    (3) Contents of the statement. The statement shall--
    (i) Be clearly identified as an election to have partnership items 
treated as nonpartnership items because of notification of suspension of 
action on a refund claim,
    (ii) Identify the partnership by name, address, and taxpayer 
identification number,
    (iii) Identify the partner making the election by name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number,
    (iv) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the election 
applies, and
    (v) Be signed by the partner making the election.
    (e) Effective date. This section applies with respect to any claim 
described in paragraph (a) of this section that is filed after December 
10, 1984.

and efficient enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, 
partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable 
year ending on or before the last day of the latest taxable year of the 
partner to which the criminal investigation relates shall be treated as 
nonpartnership items as of the date on which the partner is notified 
that he or she is the subject of a criminal investigation and receives 
written notification from the Service that his or her partnership items 
shall be treated as nonpartnership items. The partnership items of a 
partner who is notified that he or she is the subject of a criminal 
investigation shall not be treated as nonpartnership items under this 
section unless and until such partner receives written notification from 
the Service of such treatment.

of proof of income will interfere with the effective and efficient 
enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, partnership items 
of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable year ending on or 
before the last day of the taxable year of the partner for which a 
deficiency notice based upon an indirect method of proof of income is 
mailed to the partner shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the

Sec. 301.6231(c)-7T  Bankruptcy and receivership (temporary).

    (a) Bankruptcy. The treatment of items as partnership items with 
respect to a partner named as a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding will 
interfere with the effective and efficient enforcement of the internal 
revenue laws. Accordingly, partnership items of such a partner arising 
in any partnership taxable year ending on or before the last day of the 
latest taxable year of the partner with respect to which the United 
States could file a claim for income tax due in the bankruptcy 
proceeding shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the date the 
petition naming the partner as debtor is filed in bankruptcy.
    (b) Receivership. The treatment of items as partnership items with 
respect to a partner for whom a receiver has been appointed in any 
receivership proceeding before any court of the United States or of any 
State or the District of Columbia will interfere with the effective and 
efficient enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, 
partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable 
year ending on or before the last day of the latest taxable year of the 
partner with respect to which the United States could file a claim for 
income tax due in the receivership proceeding shall be treated as 
nonpartnership items as of the date a receiver is appointed in any

Sec. 301.6231(d)-1T  Time for determining profits interest of partners for purposes of sections 6223(b) and 6231(a)(11) (temporary).

    (a) Partner owns interest at close of year. For purposes of section 
6223(b) (relating to special rules for partnerships with more than 100 
partners) and section 6231(a)(11) (relating to 5-percent groups), except 
as otherwise provided in this section, the profits interest held by a 
partner, directly or indirectly through one or more pass-thru partners, 
in a partnership (the ``audit partnership'') to which subchapter C of 
chapter 63 of the Code applies shall be determined at the close of the 
audit partnership's taxable year.
    (b) Partner does not own interest at close of year. If the entire 
direct and indirect interest of a partner in an audit partnership is 
terminated by virtue of a disposition by such partner of such interest 
(or by virtue of the disposition of an interest held by one or more 
pass-thru partners through which the partner holds an interest), then 
the profits interest of such partner in the audit partnership shall be 
measured as of the moment before the disposition causing such 
termination. The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to a 
termination if subsequent to such termination and before the close of 
the audit partnership's taxable year the partner acquires a direct or 
indirect interest in the audit partnership.
    (c) Disposition of last remaining portion of interest is disposition 
of entire interest. If a partner (or a pass-thru partner through which a 
partner holds an interest) makes several partial dispositions of an 
interest in an audit partnership during a taxable year of the audit 
partnership, paragraph (b) of this section will apply with respect to 
the disposition which causes a termination of the partner's entire 
direct and indirect interest in the audit partnership.
    (d) No profits interest in certain cases. If--
    (1) The interest of a partner in a partnership is entirely disposed 
of before the close of the taxable year of the partnership, and
    (2) No items of the partnership for that taxable year are required 
to be taken into account by the partner,

that partner has no profits interest in the partnership for that taxable 
year. For example, if a partner dies before the close of the taxable 
year of the partnership, generally no items of the partnership for that 
taxable year are required to be taken into account on the final return 
of the deceased partner under Sec. 1.706-1(c)(3); consequently, the 
deceased partner has no profits interest in the partnership for that 
taxable year.
    (e) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples. Assume in all examples that there have been no 
re-acquisitions prior to the close of the audit partnership's taxable 
year.

    Example 1. B holds an interest in partnership P through T, a pass-
thru partner. P uses a fiscal year ending June 30 as P's taxable year; B 
and T use the calendar year as the taxable year. As of the close of P's 
taxable year ending June 30, 1985, T holds an interest in P and B holds 
an interest in P through T. The profits interest held by B in P through 
T for that year is determined as of June 30, 1985.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that B sold 
the entire interest that B held in P through T on November 5, 1984. The 
profits interest held by B in P through T for P's taxable year ending 
June 30, 1985, is determined as of the moment before the sale on 
November 5, 1984.
    Example 3. C holds an interest in partnership P through T, a pass-
thru partner. C, P, and T all use the calendar year as the taxable year. 
T disposes of T's interest in P on June 5, 1985. The profits interest 
held by C in P through T for 1985 is determined as of the moment before 
the disposition on June 5, 1985.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C sold 
her entire interest in T (and, therefore, her entire interest that she 
held in P through T) on March 15, 1985. The profits interest held by C 
in P through T for 1985 is determined as of the moment before the sale 
on March 15, 1985.
    Example 5. On January 1, 1985, D held a 2 percent profits interest 
in partnership P. Both D and P use the calendar year as the taxable 
year. On August 1, 1985, D transfers three-fourths of D's profits 
interest in P to E. On September 1, 1985, D sells his remaining .5 
profits interest in P to F. For purposes of sections 6223(b) and 
6231(a)(11), D had a .5 percent profits interest in P for 1985.

[[Page 164]]

    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example 5, except that on 
January 1, 1985, D also held a 1 percent profits interest in partnership 
P through T, a pass-thru partner which also uses the calendar year as 
the taxable year. In addition to the sale to E on August 1, 1985, D sold 
a portion of his interest in T on December 1, 1985, such that after the 
sale, D held a .2 percent profits interest in P through T. D made no 
other transfers of interests in either P or T. For purposes of sections 
6223(b) and 6231(a)(11), D had a .7 percent profits interest in P for 
1985.

Sec. 301.6231(e)-1T  Effect of a determination with respect to a nonpartnership item on the determination of a partnership item (temporary).

    The determination of an item after it has become a nonpartnership 
item with respect to a partner is not controlling in the determination 
of that item with respect to other partners. Thus, for example, the 
determination by a court in a separate proceeding relating to a partner 
that a certain partnership expenditure was deductible does not bind 
either the Service or the other partners in a later partnership or other 
proceeding.

Sec. 301.6231(e)-2T  Judicial decision not a bar to certain adjustments (temporary).

    A court decision with respect to a partner's income tax liability 
attributable to nonpartnership items shall not be a bar to further 
proceedings with respect to that partner's income tax liability if that 
partner's partnership items become nonpartnership items after the 
appropriate time to include such nonpartnership items in the earlier 
court proceeding has passed. Thus, the Service could issue a later 
deficiency notice for the same taxable year with respect to that partner 
or that partner could bring a refund suit with respect to those items 
that have become nonpartnership items.

    (i) The tax matters partner of that partnership resides outside the 
United States, or
    (ii) The books and records of that partnership are maintained 
outside the United States.
    (b) Computational adjustment permitted if return is not filed after 
mailing of notice. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, if--
    (1) This section applies with respect to a partnership for a 
partnership taxable year,
    (2) The Service mails a notice to a partner that the losses and 
credits arising from that partnership for that year will be disallowed 
to that partner unless the partnership files a return for that year 
within 60 days after the date on which the notice is mailed, and
    (3) The partnership fails to file a return for that year within that 
60-day period, the Service may, without conducting a partnership-level 
proceeding, mail a notice of computational adjustment to that partner to 
reflect the disallowance of any loss (including a capital loss) or 
credit arising from that partnership for that year.
    (c) Restriction on notices under paragraph (b). Neither the notice 
referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section nor the notice of 
computational adjustment referred to in paragraph (b) of this section 
may be mailed on a day on which--
    (1) The tax matters partner of the partnership resides within the 
United States, and
    (2) The books and records of the partnership are maintained within 
the United States.

Thus, if this section applies with respect to a partnership for a 
taxable year solely because the tax matters partner of that partnership 
resided outside the United States for a period after the close of that 
taxable year and the tax matters partner later takes up residence within 
the United States, no notice may be mailed under paragraph (b) of this 
section while the tax matters partner resides within the United States.

[[Page 165]]

    (d) No disallowance in certain circumstances. If the person to whom 
the notice referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section establishes 
to the satisfaction of the Service--
    (1) That the losses and credits arising from the partnership for the 
year are proper, and
    (2) That the partner has made a good faith effort to have the 
partnership file the required return,

the Service may allow the losses and credits in whole or in part.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6233-1T  Extension to entities filing partnership returns, etc. (temporary).

    (a) Entities filing a partnership return. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the provisions of subchapter C of 
chapter 63 of the Code (``subchapter C'') and the regulations thereunder 
shall apply with respect to any taxable year of an entity for which such 
entity files a partnership return as well as to such entity's items for 
that taxable year and to any person holding an interest in such entity 
at any time during that taxable year. Any final partnership 
administrative adjustment or judicial determination resulting from a 
proceeding under subchapter C with respect to such taxable year may 
include a determination that the entity is not a partnership for such 
taxable year as well as determinations with respect to all items of the 
entity which would be partnership items, as defined in section 
6231(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder, if such entity had been a 
partnership in such taxable year (including, for example, any amounts 
taxable to an entity determined to be an association taxable as a 
corporation). Thus, a final determination under subchapter C that an 
entity that filed a partnership return is an association taxable as a 
corporation will serve as a basis for a computational adjustment 
reflecting the disallowance of any loss or credit claimed by a purported 
partner with respect to that entity.
    (b) Entities filing an S corporation return. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the provisions of subchapter D of 
chapter 63 of the Code (``subchapter D'') and the regulations thereunder 
shall apply with respect to any taxable year of an entity for which such 
entity files a return as an S corporation as well as to such entity's 
items for that taxable year and to any person holding an interest in 
such entity at any time during that taxable year. Any final S 
corporation administrative adjustment or judicial determination 
resulting from a proceeding under subchapter D with respect to such 
taxable year may include a determination that the entity is not an S 
corporation for such taxable year as well as determinations with respect 
to all items of the entity which would be subchapter S items, as defined 
in section 6245 and the regulations thereunder, if such entity had been 
an S corporation for such taxable year (including, for example, any 
amounts taxable to an entity determined to be taxable as a C 
corporation).
    (c) Partnership or S corporation return filed but no entity found to 
exist--(1) Partnership return filed. Paragraph (a) of this section shall 
apply where a partnership return is filed for a taxable year but it is 
determined that there is no entity for such taxable year. For purposes 
of applying paragraph (a) of this section, the partnership return shall 
be treated as if it was filed by an entity. However, any final 
partnership administrative adjustment or judicial determination 
resulting from a proceeding under subchapter C with respect to such 
taxable year may also include a determination that there is no entity 
for such taxable year.
    (2) S corporation return filed. Paragraph (b) of this section shall 
apply where an S corporation return is filed for a taxable year but it 
is determined that there is no entity for such taxable year. For 
purposes of applying paragraph (b) of this section, the S corporation 
return shall be treated as if it was filed by an entity. However, any 
final S corporation administrative adjustment or judicial determination 
resulting from a proceeding under subchapter D with respect to such 
taxable year may also include a determination that there is no entity 
for such taxable year.
    (d) Exceptions--(1) Partnership proceedings. Paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply to:

[[Page 166]]

    (i) Entities for any taxable year in which such entity would be 
excepted from the provisions of subchapter C under section 6231(a)(1)(B) 
and the regulations thereunder (relating to the exception for small 
partnerships) if such entity were a partnership for such taxable year, 
and
    (ii) Entities for any taxable year for which a partnership return 
was filed for the sole purpose of making the election described in 
section 761(a).
    (2) S corporation proceedings. [Reserved]
    (e) Effective dates. Paragraphs (a), (c)(1), and (d)(1) of this 
section shall apply with respect to any taxable year beginning after 
September 3, 1982, and with respect to any taxable year beginning on or 
before and ending after September 3, 1982, if with respect to that 
taxable year there is an agreement entered into pursuant to section 
407(a)(3) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. 
Paragraphs (b) and (c)(2) of this section shall apply with respect to 
any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1982.

[T.D. 8128, 52 FR 6795, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6241-1T  Tax treatment determined at corporate level.

    (a) In general. For a taxable year of an S corporation beginning 
after December 31, 1982, a shareholder's treatment of a subchapter S 
item (as defined in Sec. 301.6245-1T) on the shareholder's return may 
not be changed except as provided in sections 6241-6245 of the Code and 
the regulations thereunder. Thus, for example, if a shareholder treats 
an item on the shareholder's return consistently with the treatment of 
that item on the S corporation return, the Internal Revenue Service 
generally cannot adjust the treatment of that item on the shareholder's 
return except through a corporate-level proceeding. Similarly, the 
shareholder may not put a subchapter S item in issue in a proceeding 
relating to nonsubchapter S items. For example, the shareholder may not 
offset a potential increase in taxable income based on changes in 
nonsubchapter S items by a potential decrease based on subchapter S 
items.
    (b) Restrictions inapplicable after items become nonsubchapter S 
items. Section 6241 and paragraph (a) of this section cease to apply to 
items arising from an S corporation with respect to a shareholder when 
those items cease to be subchapter S items with respect to that 
shareholder under section 6231(b)(1) (as extended to and made applicable 
to subchapter S items under section 6244).
    (c) S corporation--(1) In general. For purposes of subchapter D of 
chapter 63 of the Code, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the term ``S corporation'' means any corporation required to 
file a return under section 6037(a).
    (2) Exception for small S corporations--(i) Effective date. This 
paragraph (c)(2) shall apply to any taxable year of an S corporation the 
due date of the return for which (determined without regard to 
extensions) is on or after January 30, 1987.
    (ii) Five or fewer shareholders. For purposes of this paragraph (c), 
an S corporation shall not include a small S corporation. A small S 
corporation is defined as an S corporation with 5 or fewer shareholders, 
each of whom is a natural person or an estate. For purposes of this 
paragraph (c)(2), a husband and wife (and their estates) are treated as 
one shareholder. If stock (owned other than by a husband and wife) is 
owned by tenants in common or joint tenants, each tenant in common or 
joint tenant is considered to be a shareholder of the corporation. The 
limitation is applied to the number of natural persons and estates that 
were shareholders at any one time during the taxable year of the 
corporation. Thus, for example, an S corporation that at no time during 
the taxable year had more than 5 shareholders may be treated as a small 
S corporation even if, because of transfers of interests in the 
corporation, 6 or more natural persons or estates owned stock in the 
corporation for some portion of the taxable year.
    (iii) Special rule. The exception provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section does not apply to an S corporation for a taxable year if 
any shareholder in the corporation during that taxable year is a pass-
through shareholder. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), a pass-
through shareholder is--
    (A) A trust;

[[Page 167]]

    (B) A nominee; or
    (C) Other similar pass-through persons through whom other persons 
have an ownership interest in the stock of the S corporation. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, a shareholder's estate shall not be 
treated as a pass-through shareholder.
    (iv) Determination made annually. The determination of whether an S 
corporation meets the requirements for the exception under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section shall be made for each taxable year of the 
corporation. Thus, an S corporation which does not qualify as a small S 
corporation in one taxable year may qualify as a small S corporation in 
another taxable year if the requirements for the exception under 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are met with respect to that other 
taxable year.
    (v) Election to have subchapter D of chapter 63 apply--(A) In 
general. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a small S 
corporation may elect to have the provisions of subchapter D of chapter 
63 of the Code apply with respect to that corporation.
    (B) Method of election. A small S corporation shall make the 
election described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section for a 
taxable year of the corporation by attaching a statement to the 
corporate return for the first taxable year for which the election is to 
be effective. The statement shall be identified as an election under 
Sec. 301.6241-1T(c)(2)(v)(A), shall be signed by all persons who were 
shareholders of that corporation at any time during the corporate 
taxable year to which the return relates, and shall be filed at the time 
(determined with regard to any extensions of time for filing) and place 
prescribed for filing the corporate return.
    (C) Years covered by election. The election shall be effective for 
the taxable year of the corporation to which the return relates and all 
subsequent taxable years of the corporation unless revoked with the 
consent of the Commissioner.

[T.D. 8122, 52 FR 3002, Jan. 30, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6245-1T  Subchapter S items.

    (a) In general. For purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, the following items which are required to be taken into 
account for the taxable year of an S corporation under subtitle A of the 
Code are more appropriately determined at the corporate level than at 
the shareholder level and, therefore, are subchapter S items:
    (1) The S corporation aggregate and each shareholder's share of, and 
any factor necessary to determine, each of the following:
    (i) Items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the 
corporation;
    (ii) Expenditures by the corporation not deductible in computing its 
taxable income (for example, charitable contributions);
    (iii) Items of the corporation that may be tax preference items 
under section 57(a) for any shareholder;
    (iv) Items of income of the corporation that are exempt from tax;
    (v) Corporate liabilities (including determinations of the amount of 
the liability, whether the corporate liability is to a shareholder of 
the corporation, and changes from the preceding year); and
    (vi) Other amounts determinable at the corporate level with respect 
to corporate assets, investments, transactions, and operations necessary 
to enable the S corporation or the shareholders to determine--
    (A) The general business credit provided by section 38;
    (B) Recapture under section 47 of the credit provided by section 38;
    (C) Amounts at risk in any activity to which section 465 applies;
    (D) The depletion allowance under section 613A with respect to oil 
and gas wells;
    (E) Amortization of reforestation expenses under section 194;
    (F) The credit provided by section 34 for certain uses of gasoline 
and special fuels; and
    (G) The taxes imposed at the corporate level, such as the taxes 
imposed under section 56, 1374, or 1375;
    (2) Any factor necessary to determine whether the entity is an S 
corporation under section 1361, such as the number, eligibility, and 
consent of shareholders and the classes of stock;
    (3) Any factor necessary to determine whether the entity has 
properly elected

[[Page 168]]

to be an S corporation under section 1362 for the taxable year;
    (4) Any factor necessary to determine whether and when the S 
corporation election of the entity has been revoked or terminated under 
section 1362 for the taxable year (for example, the existence and amount 
of subchapter C earnings and profits, and passive investment income); 
and
    (5) Items relating to the following transactions, to the extent that 
a determination of such items can be made from determinations that the 
corporation is required to make with respect to an amount, the character 
of an amount, or the percentage of stock ownership of a shareholder in 
the corporation, for purposes of the corporation's books and records or 
for purposes of furnishing information to a shareholder:
    (i) Contributions to the corporation; and
    (ii) Distributions from the corporation.
    (b) Factors that affect the determination of subchapter S items. The 
term ``subchapter S item'' includes the accounting practices and the 
legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of the 
existence, amount, timing, and characterization of items of income, 
credit, gain, loss, deduction, etc. Examples of these determinations 
are: The S corporation's method of accounting, taxable year, and 
inventory method; whether an election was made by the corporation; 
whether corporate property is a capital asset, section 1231 property, or 
inventory; whether an item is currently deductible or must be 
capitalized; whether corporate activities had been engaged in with the 
intent to make a profit for purposes of section 183; whether the 
corporation qualified for the credit for increasing research activities 
under section 41; and whether the corporation qualified for the credit 
for clinical testing expenses for a rare disease or condition under 
section 28.
    (c) Illustrations--(1) In general. This paragraph (c) illustrates 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The determinations 
illustrated in this paragraph (c) that the corporation is required to 
make are not exhaustive; there may be additional determinations that the 
corporation is required to make which relate to a determination listed 
in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The critical element is that the 
corporation is required to make a determination with respect to a matter 
for the purposes stated; failure by the corporation actually to make a 
determination (for example, because it does not maintain proper books 
and records) does not prevent an item from being a subchapter S item.
    (2) Contributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for 
purposes of furnishing information to a shareholder, the S corporation 
must determine:
    (i) The character of the amount received by the corporation (for 
example, whether it is a contribution, loan, or repayment of a loan);
    (ii) The amount of money received by the corporation; and
    (iii) The basis to the corporation of contributed property 
(including necessary preliminary determinations, such as the 
shareholder's basis in the contributed property).

To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a contribution 
can be made from these and similar determinations that the corporation 
is required to make, that item is a subchapter S item. To the extent 
that the determination requires other information, however, that item is 
not a subchapter S item. Such other information would include those 
factors used in determining whether there is recapture under section 47 
by the contributing shareholder of the general business credit because 
of the contribution of property in circumstances in which that 
determination is irrelevant to the corporation.
    (3) Distributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for 
purposes of furnishing information to a shareholder, the S corporation 
must determine:
    (i) The character of the amount transferred to a shareholder (for 
example, whether it is a dividend, compensation, loan, or repayment of a 
loan);
    (ii) The amount of money distributed to a shareholder;
    (iii) The fair market value of property distributed to a 
shareholder;

[[Page 169]]

    (iv) The adjusted basis to the corporation of distributed property; 
and
    (v) The character of corporation property (for example, whether an 
item is inventory or a capital asset).

To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a distribution 
can be made from these and similar determinations that the corporation 
is required to make, that item is a subchapter S item. To the extent 
that the determination requires other information, however, that item is 
not a subchapter S item. Such other information would include the 
determination of a shareholder's basis in the shareholder's stock or in 
the indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder.
    (d) Cross reference. For the definition of subchapter S item for 
purposes of the windfall profit tax, see Sec. 51.6245-1T.
    (e) Effective date. This section shall apply to taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1982.

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 301.6301-1   Collection authority.

    The taxes imposed by the internal revenue laws shall be collected by 
district directors of internal revenue. See, however, section 6304, 
relating to the collection of certain taxes under the provisions of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. ch. 4).


<R05>
Sec. 301.6302-1   Mode or time of collection of taxes.

    (a) Employment and excise taxes. For provisions relating to the mode 
or time of collection of certain employment and excise taxes and the use 
of Federal Reserve banks and authorized commercial banks in connection 
with the payment thereof, see the regulations relating to the particular 
tax.
    (b) Income taxes. (1) For provisions relating to the use of Federal 
Reserve banks or authorized commercial banks in depositing income and 
estimated income taxes of certain corporations, see Sec. 1.6302-1 of 
this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).
    (2) For provisions relating to the use of Federal Reserve banks or 
authorized commercial banks in depositing the tax required to be 
withheld under chapter 3 of the Code on nonresident aliens and foreign 
corporations and tax-free covenant bonds, see Sec. 1.6302-2 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6303-1   Notice and demand for tax.

    (a) General rule. Where it is not otherwise provided by the Code, 
the district director or the director of the regional service center 
shall, after the making of an assessment of a tax pursuant to section 
6203, give notice to each person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the 
amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be given as soon 
as possible and within 60 days. However, the failure to give notice 
within 60 days does not invalidate the notice. Such notice shall be left 
at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person, or shall be 
sent by mail to such person's last known address.
    (b) Assessment prior to last date for payment. If any tax is 
assessed prior to the last date prescribed for payment of such tax, 
demand that such tax be paid will not be made before such last date, 
except where it is believed collection would be jeopardized by delay.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6305-1  Assessment and collection of certain liability.

    (a) Scope. Section 6305(a) requires the Secretary of the Treasury or 
his delegate to assess and collect amounts which have been certified by 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the amount of a 
delinquency determined under a court order, or an order of an 
administrative process established under State law, for support and 
maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with whom the child 
is living. These amounts, referred to as ``child and spousal support'', 
are to be collected in the same manner and with the same powers 
exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate in the 
collection of an employment tax which would be jeopardized by delay. 
However, where the assessment is the first assessment against an 
individual for a delinquency described in this paragraph for a 
particular individual or individuals, the collection is to be stayed for 
a period of 60 days following

[[Page 170]]

notice and demand. In addition, no interest or penalties (with the 
exception of the penalties imposed by sections 6332(c)(2) and 6657) 
shall be assessed or collected on the amounts, paragraphs (4), (6) and 
(8) of section 6334(a) (relating to property exempt from levy) shall not 
apply; and, there shall be exempt from levy so much of the salary, 
wages, or other income of the individual which is subject to garnishment 
pursuant to a judgment entered by a court for the support of his or her 
minor children. Section 6305(b) provides that sole jurisdiction for any 
action brought to restrain or review assessment and collection of the 
certified amounts shall be in a State court or a State administrative 
agency.
    (b) Assessment and collection--(1) General rule. Upon receipt of a 
certification or recertification from the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services or his delegate under section 452(b) of Title IV of the Social 
Security Act as amended (relating to collection of child and spousal 
support obligations with respect to an individual), the district 
director or his delegate shall assess and collect the certified amount 
(or recertified amount). Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the amount so certified shall be assessed and collected in the 
same manner, with the same powers, and subject to the same limitations 
as if the amount were an employment tax the collection of which would be 
jeopardized by delay. However, the provisions of subtitle F with respect 
to assessment and collection of taxes shall not apply with respect to 
assessment and collection of a certified amount where such provisions 
are clearly inappropriate to, and incompatible with, the collection of 
certified amounts generally. For example, section 6861(g) which allows 
the Secretary or his delegate to abate a jeopardy assessment if he finds 
a jeopardy does not exist will not apply.
    (2) Method of assessment. An assessment officer appointed by the 
district director pursuant to Sec. 301.6203-1 to make assessments of tax 
shall also make assessments of certified amounts. The assessment of a 
certified amount shall be made by the assessment officer signing the 
summary record of assessment. The date of assessment is the date the 
summary record is signed by the assessment officer. The summary record, 
through supporting records as necessary, shall provide--
    (i) The assessed amount;
    (ii) The name, social security number, and last known address of the 
individual owing the assessed amount;
    (iii) A designation of the assessed amount as a certified amount, 
together with the date on which the amount was certified and the name, 
position, and governmental address of the officer of the Department of 
Health and Human Services who certified the amount;
    (iv) The period to which the child and spousal support obligation 
represented by the certified amount relates;
    (v) The State in which was entered the court or administrative order 
giving rise to the child and spousal support obligation represented by 
the certified amount;
    (vi) The name of the person or persons to whom the child and spousal 
support obligation represented by the certified amount is owed; and
    (vii) The name of the child or children or the parent of the child 
or children for whose benefit the child and spousal support obligation 
exists.

Upon request, the individual assessed shall be furnished a copy of 
pertinent parts of this assessment which set forth the information 
listed in subdivision (i) through (vii) of this paragraph (b)(2).
    (3) Supplemental assessments and abatements. If any assessment is 
incomplete or incorrect in any material respect, the district director 
or his delegate may make a supplemental assessment or abatement but only 
for the purpose of completing or correcting the original assessment. A 
supplemental assessment will not be used as a substitute for an 
additional assessment against an individual.
    (4) Method of collection. (i) The district director or his delegate 
shall make notice and demand for immediate payment of certified amounts. 
Upon failure or refusal to pay such amounts, collection by levy shall be 
lawful without regard to the 10-day waiting period provided in section 
6331(a). However, in the case of certain first assessments, paragraph 
(c)(4) of

[[Page 171]]

this section provides a rule for a stay of collection for 60 days. For 
purposes of collection, refunds of any internal revenue tax owed to the 
individual may be offset against a certified amount.
    (ii) The district director or his delegate shall make diligent and 
reasonable efforts to collect certified amounts as if such amounts were 
taxes. He shall have no authority to compromise a proceeding by 
collection of only part of a certified amount in satisfaction of the 
full certified amount owing. However, he may arrange for payment of a 
certified amount by installments where advisable.
    (iii) The district director or his delegate may offset the amount of 
any overpayment of any internal revenue tax (as described in section 
301.6401-1) to be refunded to the person making the overpayment by the 
amount of any past-due support (as defined in the regulations under 
section 6402) owed by the person making the overpayment. The amounts 
offset under section 6402(c) may be amounts of child and spousal support 
certified (or recertified) for collection under section 6305 and this 
section or they may be amounts of past-due support of which the 
Secretary of the Treasury has been notified under section 6402(c) and 
the regulations under that section.
    (5) Credits or refunds. In the case of any overpayment of a 
certified amount, the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, within 
the period of limitations for credit or refund of employment taxes, may 
credit the amount of the overpayment against any liability in respect of 
an internal revenue tax on the part of the individual who made the 
overpayment and shall refund any balance to the individual. However, the 
full amount of any overpayment collected by levy upon property described 
in paragraph (c)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section shall be 
refunded to the individual. For purposes of applying this subparagraph, 
the rules of Sec. 301.6402-2 apply where appropriate.
    (6) Disposition of certified amounts collected. Any certified amount 
collected shall be deposited in the general fund of the United States, 
and the officer of the Department of Health and Human Services who 
certified the amount shall be promptly notified of its collection. There 
shall be established in the Treasury, pursuant to section 452 of Title 
IV of the Social Security Act as amended, a revolving fund which shall 
be available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his 
delegate, without fiscal year limitation, for distribution to the States 
in accordance with the provisions of section 457 of the Act. Section 
452(c)(2) of the Act appropriates to this revolving fund out of any 
monies not otherwise appropriated, amounts equal to the certified 
amounts collected under this paragraph reduced by the amounts credited 
or refunded as overpayments of the certified amounts so collected. The 
certified amounts deposited shall be transferred at least quarterly from 
the general fund of the Treasury to the revolving fund on the basis of 
estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Proper 
adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred to the 
extent prior estimates were in excess of or less than the amounts 
required to be transferred. See, however, paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section for the special rule requiring retention in the general fund of 
certain penalties which may be collected.
    (c) Additional limitations and conditions--(1) Interest and 
penalties. No interest, penalties or additional amounts, other than 
normal and reasonable collection costs, may be assessed or collected in 
addition to the certified amount, other than the penalty imposed by 
section 6332(c)(2) for failure to surrender property subject to levy and 
the penalty imposed by section 6657 for the tender of bad checks. Any 
such penalties and collection costs, if collected, will not be treated 
as part of the certified amount and will be retained by the United 
States as a part of its general fund. No interest shall be allowed or 
paid on any overpayment of a certified amount.
    (2) Property not exempt from levy. In addition to property not 
exempt from levy under section 6334(c) and the regulations thereunder, 
the following property shall not be exempt from a levy to collect a 
certified amount:
    (i) Unemployment benefits described in section 6334(a)(4);

[[Page 172]]

    (ii) Certain annuities and pension payments described in section 
6334(a)(6); or
    (iii) Salary, wages, or other income described in section 
6334(a)(8).
    (3) Property exempt from levy. In addition to property exempt from 
levy under section 6334(a) and the regulations thereunder, other than 
property described in paragraph (c)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section, there shall be exempt from levy to collect a certified amount 
so much of the salary, wages, or other income of an individual as is 
withheld therefrom in garnishment pursuant to judgment entered by a 
court of competent jurisdiction for the support of minor children of the 
individual.
    (4) First assessment. In the case of a first assessment against an 
individual for a certified amount in whole or part for the benefit of a 
particular child or children or the child or children and their parent, 
the collection of the certified amount shall be stayed for the period of 
60 days immediately following notice and demand as described in section 
6303. However, no other stay of the collection of a certified amount may 
be granted. Thus, the provisions of section 6863(a), relating to bonds 
to stay collection of jeopardy assessments, shall not apply to the 
collection of certified amounts.
    (5) Priority of liens. A lien for a certified amount shall be valid 
as against a lien for taxes imposed by section 6321 only if the date of 
assessment of the certified amount precedes the date of assessment of 
the taxes. However, no amount collected by levy upon property described 
in paragraph (c)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section may be applied 
other than in whole or partial satisfaction of certified amounts. In the 
case of two liens for certified amounts, the lien for the certified 
amount which is first assessed shall be valid as against the lien for 
the certified amount which is later assessed.
    (6) Statute of limitations on collections. The periods of limitation 
on collection of taxes after assessment prescribed by section 6502 shall 
apply to the collection of certified (or recertified) amounts. Such 
periods of limitation with respect to a certified amount shall terminate 
upon recertification of the amount, and the period of limitation 
prescribed by section 6502 shall then apply and commence to run with 
respect to the recertified amount.
    (d) Review of assessments and collections--(1) Federal courts. No 
court of the United States established under article I or article III of 
the Constitution has jurisdiction of any legal or equitable action to 
restrain or review the assessment or collection of certified amounts by 
the district director or his delegate. See, however, paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section for the rule that the prohibition of this paragraph (d)(1) 
does not preclude courts established for the District of Columbia from 
exercising jurisdiction over certain actions.
    (2) Secretary of the Treasury. Neither the Secretary of the Treasury 
nor his delegate may subject to review the assessment or collection of 
certified amounts in any legal, equitable, or administrative proceeding.
    (3) State courts. This paragraph (d) does not preclude a State court 
or appropriate State agency, as the case may be, from exercising 
jurisdiction over a legal, equitable, or administrative action against 
the State by an individual to determine his liability for any certified 
amount assessed against him and collected, or to recover any such 
certified amount collected, under section 6305 and this section. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ``State'' includes the 
District of Columbia.
    (e) Internal Revenue regional service centers. For purposes of this 
section, the terms ``district director or his delegate'' and ``district 
director'' include the director of the Internal Revenue service center 
or his delegate, as the case may be.

                           Receipt of Payment


<R05>
Sec. 301.6311-1   Payment by check or money order.

    (a) Authority to receive--(1) In general. (i) District directors, 
Service Center directors, and Compliance Center directors (director) may 
accept checks or drafts drawn on any financial institution incorporated 
under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, the 
District of Columbia, or any possession of the United States, or money 
orders in payment for internal revenue taxes, provided the checks, 
drafts, or money orders are collectible in United States currency at 
par, and subject to the further provisions contained in this section. 
The director may accept the checks, drafts, or money orders in payment 
for internal revenue stamps to the extent and under the conditions 
prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A check or money order 
in payment for internal revenue taxes or internal revenue stamps should 
be made payable to the Internal Revenue Service. A check or money order 
is payable at par only if the full amount thereof is payable without any 
deduction for exchange or other charges. As used in this section, the 
term ``money order'' means: (a) U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph 
money order; (b) money order issued by a domestic building and loan 
association (as defined in section 7701(a)(19)) or by a similar 
association incorporated under the laws of a possession of the United 
States; (c) a money order issued by such other organization as the 
Commissioner may designate; and (d) a money order described in 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in cases therein described. 
However, the director may refuse to accept any personal check whenever 
he or she has good reason to believe that such check will not be honored 
upon presentment.
    (ii) An American citizen residing in a country with which the United 
States maintains direct exchange of money orders on a domestic basis may 
pay his tax by postal money order of such country. For a list of such 
countries, see section 171.27 of the Postal Manual of the United States.
    (iii) If one check or money order is remitted to cover two or more 
persons' taxes, the remittance should be accompanied by a letter of 
transmittal clearly identifying--
    (a) Each person whose tax is to be paid by the remittance;
    (b) The amount of the payment on account of each such person; and
    (c) The kind of tax paid.
    (2) Payment for internal revenue stamps. The director may accept 
checks, drafts, and money orders described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section in payment for internal revenue stamps. However, the director 
may refuse to accept any personal check whenever he or she has good 
reason to believe that such check will not be honored upon presentment.
    (b) Checks or money orders not paid--(1) Ultimate liability. The 
person who tenders any check (whether certified or uncertified, 
cashier's, treasurer's, or other form of check or draft) or money order 
in payment for taxes or stamps is not released from his or her liability 
until the check, draft, or money order is paid; and, if the check, 
draft, or money order is not duly paid, the person shall also be liable 
for all legal penalties and additions, to the same extent as if such 
check, draft, or money order had not been tendered.
    (2) Liability of financial institutions and others. If any 
certified, treasurer's, or cashier's check, or other guaranteed draft, 
or money order, is not duly paid, the United States shall have a lien 
for the amount of such check or draft upon all assets of the financial 
institution on which drawn, or for the amount of such money order upon 
the assets of the issuer thereof. The unpaid amount shall be paid out of 
such assets in preference to any other claims against such financial 
institution or issuer except the necessary costs and expenses of 
administration and the reimbursement of the United States for the amount 
expended in the redemption of the circulating notes of such financial 
institution. In addition, the Government has the right to exact payment 
from the person required to make the payment.
    (c) Payment in nonconvertible foreign currency. For rules relating 
to payment of income taxes and taxes under the Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act in nonconvertible foreign currency, see

[[Page 174]]

section 6316 and the regulations thereunder.
    (d) Financial institution. For purposes of section 6311 and this 
section, financial institution includes but is not limited to--
    (1) A bank or trust company (as defined in section 581);
    (2) A domestic building and loan association (as defined in section 
7701(a)(19));
    (3) A mutual savings bank (including but not limited to a mutual 
savings bank as defined in section 591(b));
    (4) A credit union (including both state and federal credit unions, 
and including but not limited to a credit union as defined in section 
501(c)(14)); and
    (5) A regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)).

<R05>
Sec. 301.6312-1   Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, and Treasury bills acceptable in payment of internal revenue taxes or stamps.

    (a) Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or 
Treasury bills of any series (not including interim receipts issued by 
Federal reserve banks in lieu of definitive certificates, notes, or 
bills) may be tendered at or before maturity in payment of internal 
revenue taxes due on the date (or in payment for stamps purchased on the 
date), on which the certificates, notes, or bills mature, or in payment 
of internal revenue taxes due on a specified prior date, but only if 
such certificates, notes, or bills, according to the express terms of 
their issue, are made acceptable in payment of such taxes or for the 
purchase of stamps. If the taxes for which the certificates, notes, or 
bills are tendered in payment become due, or the stamps are purchased, 
on the same date as that on which such certificates, notes, or bills 
mature, they will be accepted at par plus accrued interest, if any, 
payable with the principal (not represented by coupons attached) in 
payment of such taxes or stamps. If the taxes for which the 
certificates, notes, or bills are tendered in payment become due, or the 
stamps are purchased, on a date prior to that on which the certificates, 
notes, or bills mature, they will be accepted at the value specified in 
the terms under which such certificates, notes, or bills were issued. 
All interest coupons attached to Treasury certificates of indebtedness 
or Treasury notes shall be detached by the taxpayer before such 
certificates or notes are tendered in payment of taxes or stamps.
    (b) Receipts given by a district director for Treasury certificates 
of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or Treasury bills received in payment 
of internal revenue taxes or for stamps as provided in this section 
shall contain an adequate description of such certificates, notes, or 
bills, and a statement of the value, including accrued interest, if any, 
payable with the principal (not represented by coupons attached), at 
which accepted, and shall show that the certificates, notes, or bills 
are tendered by the taxpayer and received by the district director, 
subject to no conditions, qualification, or reservation whatsoever, in 
payment of an amount of taxes or for stamps no greater than such value. 
Any certificate, note, or bill offered in payment of internal revenue 
taxes or for stamps subject to any condition, qualification, or 
reservation, or for any greater amount than the value at which 
acceptable in payment of taxes or stamps, as specified in the terms 
under which such certificate, note, or bill was issued, shall not be 
deemed to be duly tendered and shall be returned to the taxpayer.
    (c) For the purpose of saving taxpayers the expense of transmitting 
Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or Treasury bills 
to the office of the district director in whose district the taxes are 
payable, or stamps are to be purchased, taxpayers desiring to pay taxes, 
or purchase stamps, with such certificates, notes, or bills acceptable 
in payment of taxes or for the purchase of stamps may deposit such 
certificates, notes, or bills with a Federal reserve bank or branch, or 
with the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, Treasury 
Building, Washington, D.C. In such cases, the Federal reserve bank or 
branch, or the Office of the Treasurer of the United

[[Page 175]]

States, shall issue a receipt in the name of the district director, 
describing the certificates, notes, or bills by par or dollar face 
amount and stating on the face of the receipt that the certificates, 
notes, or bills represented thereby are held by the bank or branch, or 
the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, for redemption at the 
value specified in the terms under which the certificates, notes, or 
bills were issued, and for application of the proceeds in payment of 
taxes due or for the purchase of stamps on a specified date by the 
taxpayer named therein.
    (d) In the case of payments of tax required to be deposited with 
Government depositaries by regulations under section 6302 of the Code, 
certificates, notes, or bills referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section may be deposited with a Federal Reserve bank or branch, or with 
the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, in part or full 
satisfaction of such tax liability. As in the case of all remittances of 
amounts so required to be deposited, each such deposit of certificates, 
notes, or bills shall be accompanied by the appropriate deposit form in 
accordance with the regulations under section 6302. In such cases, 
notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, receipts for 
such certificates, notes or bills shall no longer be issued in the name 
of the district director.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6312-2   Certain Treasury savings notes acceptable in payment of certain internal revenue taxes.

    According to the express terms of their issue, the following series 
of Treasury savings notes are presently acceptable in payment of income 
taxes (current and back, personal and corporation taxes, and excess 
profits taxes) and estate and gift taxes (current and back):

    (a) Treasury Savings Notes, Series A,
    (b) Treasury Savings Notes, Series B,
    (c) Treasury Savings Notes, Series C.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6313-1   Fractional parts of a cent.

    In the payment of any tax not payable by stamp, a fractional part of 
a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, 
in which case it shall be increased to one cent. Fractional parts of a 
cent shall not be disregarded in the computation of taxes.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6314-1   Receipt for taxes.

    (a) In general. The district director or the director of a service 
center shall upon request, issue a receipt for each tax payment made 
(other than a payment for stamps sold and delivered). In addition, the 
district director or the director of a service center shall issue a 
receipt for each payment of 1 dollar or more made in cash, whether or 
not requested. In the case of payments made by check, the canceled check 
is usually a sufficient receipt. No receipt shall be issued in lieu of a 
stamp representing a tax, whether the payment is in cash or otherwise.
    (b) Duplicate receipt for payment of estate taxes. Upon request, the 
district director or the director of a service center will issue 
duplicate receipts to the person paying the estate tax, either of which 
will be sufficient evidence of such payment and entitle the executor to 
be credited with the amount by any court having jurisdiction to audit or 
settle his accounts. For definition of the term ``executor'', see 
section 2203.

4, 301.6316-5, and 301.6316-6 means the income tax imposed for the 
taxable year by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and as 
used in Sec. 301.6316-7 means the Federal Insurance Contributions Act 
taxes imposed by chapter 21 of the Code (or by the corresponding 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). The term ``tax'', as 
used in Secs. 301.6316-3 and 301.6316-9 shall relate to either of such 
taxes, whichever is appropriate.
    (b) The term nonconvertible foreign currency means currency of the 
government of a foreign country which, owing to (1) monetary, exchange, 
or other restrictions imposed by the foreign country, (2) an agreement 
entered into with the United States of America, or (3) the terms and 
conditions of the U.S. Government grant, is not convertible into U.S.

Sec. 301.6316-3   Allocation of tax attributable to foreign currency.

    (a) Adjusted gross income ratio. The portion of the tax which is 
attributable to amounts received in nonconvertible foreign currency 
shall, for purposes of applying Sec. 301.6316-1 to the currency of each 
foreign country, be the amount by which:
    (1) The amount which bears the same ratio to the entire tax for the 
taxable year as (i) the taxpayer's adjusted gross income received in 
that currency

[[Page 177]]

bears to (ii) the adjusted gross income determined under section 62 by 
taking into account the entire gross income and all deductions allowable 
under that section without distinction as to amounts received in foreign 
currency, exceeds
    (2) The total of the allowable credits against tax, and payments on 
account of tax, which are properly allocable to the amount of that 
currency included in gross income.
    (b) Example. (1) For the calendar year 1955 Mr. Jones and his wife 
filed a joint return on which the adjusted gross income is as follows,

    (2) The following amounts are allowable as properly deductible from 
adjusted gross income, no determination being made as to whether or not 
any part of them is properly allocable to the Fulbright grant:


Deduction for personal exemptions..............................   $3,000
Charitable contributions.......................................      500
Interest expense...............................................      400
Taxes..........................................................      300

    (3) For the taxable year the following amounts are allowable as 
credits against the tax, or as payments on account of the tax:


Foreign tax credit for foreign taxes paid on Fulbright grant..   $300.00

    (4) The portion of the tax which is attributable to amounts received 
in nonconvertible foreign currency is $33.49, determined as follows:


Adjusted gross income..............................           $14,000.00

    (b) Statements required. (1) A statement, prepared by the taxpayer, 
and certified by the foundation, commission, or other person having 
control of the payments made to the taxpayer in nonconvertible foreign 
currency, shall be attached to the return showing that for the taxable 
year involved the taxpayer is entitled to pay tax in foreign currency in

amount thereof paid in nonconvertible foreign currency. It shall also 
state that with respect to the grant or compensation the applicable 
percentage requirement of Sec. 301.6316-1 is satisfied.
    (2) The taxpayer shall also attach to the return a detailed 
statement showing (i) the computation, in the manner prescribed by 
Sec. 301.6316-3, of the portion of the tax attributable to amounts 
received in nonconvertible foreign currency and (ii) the rates of 
exchange used in determining the tax liability in U.S. dollars. See 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6316-5.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6316-5   Manner of paying tax by foreign currency.

    (a) Time and place to pay. The unpaid tax required to be shown on a 
return filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6316-4, whether payable in 
whole or in part in foreign currency, is due and payable to the Director 
of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 
20225, at the time the return is filed. However, see paragraph (d) of 
this section with respect to the depositing of the foreign currency with 
the disbursing officer of the Department of State.
    (b) Certified statement. Every taxpayer who desires to pay tax in 
foreign currency under the provisions of Sec. 301.6316-1 shall first 
obtain the certified statement referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of 
Sec. 301.6316-4.
    (c) Determination of the tax. In determining the tax payable for the 
taxable year in U.S. dollars, the taxpayer, with respect to amounts 
described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6316-1, or amounts described in 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6316-1 received before November 1, 1965, shall 
use the rates of exchange which most clearly reflect the correct tax 
liability in dollars, whether it be the official rate, the open market 
rate, or any other appropriate rate. With respect to amounts described 
in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6316-1 received on or after November 1, 
1965, the taxpayer shall use the official rate of exchange in 
determining the tax payable for the taxable year in U.S. dollars. After 
determining the correct tax liability in U.S. dollars the taxpayer shall 
then ascertain, in accordance with the principles of Sec. 301.6316-3, 
the portion of the tax which is attributable to amounts received in 
nonconvertible foreign currency.
    (d) Deposit of foreign currency with disbursing officer. (1) After 
the portion of the tax which is attributable to amounts received in 
nonconvertible foreign currency is determined in U.S. dollars, the 
amount so determined shall be deposited in the same nonconvertible 
foreign currency with the disbursing officer of the Department of State 
for the foreign country where the fund is located from which the 
payments in nonconvertible foreign currency are made to the taxpayer. 
The amount of foreign currency to be deposited shall be that amount 
which, when converted at the rate of exchange used on the date of 
deposit by that disbursing officer for the acquisition of such currency 
for his official disbursements, equals the portion of the tax so 
determined in U.S. dollars.
    (2) The disbursing officer may rely upon the taxpayer for the 
determination of the amount of tax payable in foreign currency but may 
not accept any such currency for deposit until the taxpayer has 
presented for inspection the certified statement referred to in 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 301.6316-4. Upon acceptance of foreign currency 
for deposit the disbursing officer shall give the taxpayer a receipt in 
duplicate showing the name and address of the depositor, the date of the 
deposit, the amount of foreign currency deposited, and its equivalent in 
U.S. dollars on the date of deposit.
    (3) Every taxpayer making a deposit of foreign currency in 
accordance with this paragraph shall attach to the return required to be 
filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6316-4, in part or full payment of the 
taxes shown thereon, the original of the receipt given by the disbursing 
officer and shall pay to the Director of International Operations in 
U.S. dollars the balance, if any, of the tax shown to be due. Tender of 
such receipt to the Director of International Operations shall be 
considered as payment of tax in an amount equal to the U.S. dollars 
represented by the receipt.
    (4) A taxpayer shall make the deposit required by this paragraph in 
ample time to permit him to attach the receipt to his return for filing 
within the time prescribed by section 6072 or 6081

Sec. 301.6316-6   Declarations of estimated tax.

    (a) Filing of declaration. A declaration of estimated tax in respect 
of amounts on which the tax is to be paid in foreign currency under the 
provisions of Sec. 301.6316-1 shall be filed with the Director of 
International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 
20225, and shall have attached thereto the statements required by 
paragraph (b) (1) and (2)(i) of Sec. 301.6316-4 in respect of the tax 
return except that the statement certified by the foundation, 
commission, or other person having control of the payments to the 
taxpayer in nonconvertible foreign currency may be based upon amounts 
expected to be received by the taxpayer during the taxable year if they 
are not in fact known at the time of certification. A copy of this 
certified statement shall be retained by the taxpayer for the purpose of 
exhibiting it to the disbursing officer when making installment deposits 
of foreign currency under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section. For the time for filing declarations of estimated tax, see 
sections 6073 and 6081 and Secs. 1.6073-1 to 1.6073-4, inclusive, and 
Secs. 1.6081-1 and 1.6081-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).
    (b) Determination of estimated tax-- (1) Allocation of tax 
attributable to foreign currency. In determining the amount of estimated 
tax for purposes of this section, all items of income, deduction, and 
credit, whether or not attributable to amounts received in 
nonconvertible foreign currency, shall be taken into account. The 
portion of the estimated tax which is attributable to amounts to be 
received during the taxable year in nonconvertible foreign currency 
shall be determined consistently with the manner prescribed by 
Sec. 301.6316-3.
    (2) Example. (i) For the calendar year 1955 Mr. Jones and his wife 
filed a joint declaration of estimated tax in the determination of which 
the adjusted gross income was estimated to be as follows, after amounts 
to be received in foreign currency had been properly translated into 
U.S. dollars for tax computation purposes:

Fulbright grant to be received by Mr. Jones in nonconvertible           
 foreign currency..............................................   $8,000
Dividends to be received by Mr. Jones entitled to dividends-

    Total estimated adjusted gross income......................   13,000
                                                                        

    (ii) The following amounts were determined to be allowable as 
properly deductible from estimated adjusted gross income, no 
determination being made as to whether or not any part of them was 
properly allocable to the Fulbright grant:

Deduction for personal exemptions..............................   $3,000
Charitable contributions.......................................      300
Interest expense...............................................      400
Taxes..........................................................      300
                                                                --------
    Total allowable deductions.................................    4,000
                                                                        

    (iii) The following estimated amounts were determined to be 
allowable as credits against the tax for the taxable year:

    Total allowable estimated credits..............               619.80
                                                                        

    (iv) The portion of the estimated tax which is attributable to

 entire estimated adjusted gross income

of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
    (c) Payment of tax--(1) Determination of the tax. In determining in

    If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the 
same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional

that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in

[[Page 182]]

favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property,

person. For purposes of section 6321 and this section, the term ``any 
tax'' shall include a State individual income tax which is a ``qualified 
tax'', as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6361-4. The lien attaches 
to all property and rights to property belonging to such person at any 
time during the period of the lien, including any property or rights to 
property acquired by such person after the lien arises. Solely for 
purposes of sections 6321 and 6331, any interest in restricted land held 
in trust by the United States for an individual noncompetent Indian (and 
not for a tribe) shall not be deemed to be property, or a right to 
property, belonging to such Indian. For the method of allocating amounts 
collected pursuant to a lien between the Federal Government and a State 
or States imposing a qualified tax with respect to which the lien

    (a) Invalidity of lien without notice. The lien imposed by section 
6321 is not valid against any purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of 
Sec. 301.6323(h)--1), holder of a security interest (as defined in 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(h)--1), mechanic's lienor (as defined in 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1), or judgment lien creditor (as 
defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) until a notice of lien 
is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1). Except as provided by 
section 6323, if a person becomes a purchaser, holder of a security 
interest, mechanic's lienor, or judgment lien creditor after a notice of 
lien is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the interest 
acquired by such person is subject to the lien imposed by section 6321.

afforded a security interest arising after tax lien filing, which 
interest is covered by a commercial transactions financing agreement, 
real property construction or improvement financing agreement, or an

Sec. 301.6323(b)-1  Protection for certain interests even though notice filed.

    (a) Securities--(1) In general. Even though a notice of a lien 
imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, 
the lien is not valid with respect to a security (as defined in 
paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) against--
    (i) A purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) 
of the security who at the time of purchase did not have actual notice 
or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the 
existence of the lien;
    (ii) A holder of a security interest (as defined in paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) in the security who did not have actual notice or 
knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the 
existence of the lien at the time the security interest came into 
existence or at the time such security interest was acquired from a 
previous holder for a consideration in money or money's worth; or
    (iii) A transferee of an interest protected under subdivision (i) or 
(ii) of this subparagraph to the same extent the lien is invalid against 
his transferor.

For purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, no person can 
improve his position with respect to the lien by

[[Page 183]]

reacquiring the interest from an intervening purchaser or holder of a 
security interest against whom the lien is invalid.
    (2) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. On May 1, 1969, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a 
notice of lien is filed with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. On 
May 20, 1969. A sells 100 shares of common stock in X corporation to B, 
who, on the date of the sale, does not have actual notice or knowledge 
of the existence of the lien. Because B purchased the stock without 
actual notice or knowledge of the lien, under subdivision (i) of 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the stock purchased by B is not 
subject to the lien.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on May 
30, 1969, B sells the 100 shares of common stock in X corporation to C 
who on May 5, 1969, had actual notice of the existence of the tax lien 
against A. Because the X stock when purchased by B was not subject to 
the lien, under subdivision (iii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, 
the stock purchased by C is not subject to the lien. C succeeds to B's 
rights, even though C had actual notice of the lien before B's purchase.
    Example 3. On June 1, 1970, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a 
notice of lien is filed with respect to D's delinquent tax liability. D 
owns 20 $1,000 bonds issued by the Y company. On June 10, 1970, D 
obtains a loan from M bank for $5,000 using the Y company bonds as 
collateral. At the time the loan is made M bank does not have actual 
notice or knowledge of the existence of the tax lien. Because M bank did 
not have actual notice or knowledge of the lien when the security 
interest came into existence, under subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) 
of this paragraph, the tax lien is not valid against M bank to the 
extent of its security interest.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3 except that on June 
19, 1970, M bank assigns the chose in action and its security interest 
to N, who had actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien on 
June 1, 1970. Because the security interest was not subject to the lien 
to the extent of M bank's security interest, the security interest held 
by N is to the same extent entitled to priority over the tax lien 
because N succeeds to M bank's rights. See subdivision (iii) of 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

    Example 5. On July 1, 1970, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a 
notice of lien is filed with respect to E's delinquent tax liability. E 
owns ten $1,000 bonds issued by the Y company. On July 5, 1970, E 
borrows $4,000 from F and delivers the bonds to F as collateral for the 
loan. At the time the loan is made, F has actual knowledge of the 
existence of the tax lien and, therefore, holds the security interest 
subject to the lien on the bonds. On July 10, 1970, F sells the security 
interest to G for $4,000 and delivers the Y company bonds pledged as 
collateral. G does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence 
of the lien on July 10, 1970. Because G did not have actual notice or 
knowledge of the lien at the time he purchased the security interest, 
under subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the tax 
lien is not valid against G to the extent of his security interest.

    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that, 
instead of purchasing the security interest from F on July 10, 1970, G 
lends $4,000 to F and takes a security interest in F's security interest 
in the bonds on that date. Because G became the holder of a security 
interest in a security interest after notice of lien was filed and does 
not directly have a security interest in a security, the security 
interest held by G is not entitled to a priority over the tax lien under 
the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

    (b) Motor vehicles--(1) In general. Even though a notice of a lien 
imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, 
the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) 
of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) of a motor vehicle (as defined in paragraph (c) 
of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) if--
    (i) At the time of the purchase, the purchaser did not have actual 
notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) 
of the existence of the lien, and
    (ii) Before the purchaser obtains such notice or knowledge, he has 
acquired actual possession of the motor vehicle and has not thereafter 
relinquished actual possession to the seller or his agent.
    (2) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example (1). A, a delinquent taxpayer against whom a notice of tax 
lien has been filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, sells his 
automobile (which qualifies as a motor vehicle under paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) to B, an automobile dealer. B takes actual 
possession of the automobile and does not thereafter relinquish actual 
possession to the seller or his agent. Subsequent to his purchase, B 
learns of the existence of the tax lien against A. Even though notice of 
lien was filed before the purchase, the lien is not valid against B, 
because B did not know of the existence of the lien before the purchase 

[[Page 184]]

and before acquiring actual possession of the vehicle.

    Example (2). C is a wholesaler of used automobiles. A notice of lien 
has been filed with respect to C's delinquent tax liability in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to such filing, D, a used 
automobile dealer, purchases and takes actual possession of 20 
automobiles (which qualify as motor vehicles under the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) from C at an auction and places 
them on his lot for sale. C does not reacquire possession of any of the 
automobiles. At the time of his purchase, D does not have actual notice 
or knowledge of the existence of the lien against C. Even though notice 
of lien was filed before D's purchase, the lien was not valid against D 
because D did not know of the existence of the lien before the purchase 
and before acquiring actual possession of the vehicles.

    (3) Cross reference. For provisions relating to additional 
circumstances in which the lien imposed by section 6321 may not be valid 
against the purchaser of tangible personal property (including a motor 
vehicle) purchased at retail, see paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Personal property purchased at retail--(1) In general. Even 
though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance 
with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as 
defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) of tangible personal 
property purchased at a retail sale (as defined in subparagraph (2) of 
this paragraph (c)) unless at the time of purchase the purchaser intends 
the purchase to (or knows that the purchase will) hinder, evade, or 
defeat the collection of any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954.
    (2) Definition of retail sale. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``retail sale'' means a sale, made in the ordinary course of the 
seller's trade or business, of tangible personal property of which the 
seller is the owner. Such term includes a sale in customary retail 
quantities by a seller who is going out of business, but does not 
include a bulk sale or an auction sale in which goods are offered in 
quantities substantially greater than are customary in the ordinary 
course of the seller's trade or business or an auction sale of goods the 
owner of which is not in the business of selling such goods.
    (3) Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. A purchases a refrigerator from the M company, a retail 
appliance dealer. Prior to such purchase, a notice of lien was filed 
with respect to M's delinquent tax liability in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. At the time of the purchase A knows of the existence 
of the lien. However, A does not intend the purchase to hinder, evade, 
or defeat the collection of any internal revenue tax, and A does not 
have any reason to believe that the purchase will affect the collection 
of any internal revenue tax. Even though notice of lien was filed before 
the purchase, the lien is not valid against A because A in good faith 
purchased the refrigerator at retail in the ordinary course of the M 
company's business.

    (d) Personal property purchased in casual sale--(1) In general. Even 
though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance 
with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as 
defined in Sec. 301.6323(h)-1(f)) of household goods, personal effects, 
or other tangible personal property of a type described in 
Sec. 301.6334-1 (which includes wearing apparel; school books; fuel, 
provisions, furniture, arms for personal use, livestock, and poultry 
(whether or not the seller is the head of a family); and books and tools 
of a trade, business, or profession (whether or not the trade, business, 
or profession of the seller)), purchased, other than for resale, in a 
casual sale for less than $250 (excluding interest and expenses 
described in Sec. 301.6323(e)-1). For purposes of this paragraph, a 
casual sale is a sale not made in the ordinary course of the seller's 
trade or business.
    (2) Limitation. This paragraph applies only if the purchaser does 
not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 301.6323(i)-1)--
    (i) Of the existence of the tax lien, or
    (ii) That the sale is one of a series of sales.

For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a sale is one of 
a series of sales if the seller plans to dispose of, in separate 
transactions, substantially all of his household goods, personal 
effects, and other tangible personal property described in 
Sec. 301.6334-1.
    (3) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:


[[Page 185]]


    Example 1. A, an attorney's widow, sells a set of law books for $200 
to B, for B's own use. Prior to the sale a notice of lien was filed with 
respect to A's delinquent tax liability in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. B has no actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien. 
In addition, B does not know that the sale is one of a series of sales. 
Because the sale is a casual sale for less than $250 and involves books 
of a profession (tangible personal property of a type described in 
Sec. 301.6334-1, irrespective of the fact that A has never engaged in 
the legal profession), the tax lien is not valid against B even though a 
notice of lien was filed prior to the time of B's purchase.

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that B 
purchases the books for resale in his second-hand bookstore. Because B 
purchased the books for resale, he purchased the books subject to the 
lien.

    Example 3. In an advertisement appearing in a local newspaper, G 
indicates that he is offering for sale a lawn mower, a used television 
set, a desk, a refrigerator, and certain used dining room furniture. In 
response to the advertisement, H purchases the dining room furniture for 
$200. H does not receive any information which would impart notice of a 
lien, or that the sale is one of a series of sales, beyond the 
information contained in the advertisement. Prior to the sale a notice 
of lien was filed with respect to G's delinquent tax liability in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Because H had no actual notice or 
knowledge that substantially all of G's households goods were being 
sold, or that the sale is one of a series of sales and because the sale 
is a casual sale for less than $250, H does not purchase the dining room 
furniture subject to the lien. The household goods are of a type 
described in Sec. 301.6334-1(a)(2) irrespective of whether G is the head 
of a family or whether all such household goods offered for sale exceed 
$500 in value.

    (e) Personal property subject to possessory liens. Even though a 
notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a holder of a lien on 
tangible personal property which under local law secures the reasonable 
price of the repair or improvement of the property if the property is, 
and has been, continuously in the possession of the holder of the lien 
from the time the possessory lien arose. For example, if local law gives 
an automobile repairman the right to retain possession of an automobile 
he has repaired as security for payment of the repair bill and the 
repairman retains continuous possession of the automobile until his lien 
is satisfied, a tax lien filed in accordance with section 6323(f)(1) 
which has attached to the automobile will not be valid to the extent of 
the reasonable price of the repairs. It is immaterial that the notice of 
tax lien was filed before the repairman undertook his work or that he 
knew of the lien before undertaking the work.
    (f) Real property tax and special assessment liens--(1) In general. 
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against the 
holder of another lien upon the real property (regardless of when such 
other lien arises), if such other lien is entitled under local law to 
priority over security interests in real property which are prior in 
time and if such other lien on real property secures payment of--
    (i) A tax of general application levied by any taxing authority 
based upon the value of the property;
    (ii) A special assessment imposed directly upon the property by any 
taxing authority, if the assessment is imposed for the purpose of 
defraying the cost of any public improvement; or
    (iii) Charges for utilities or public services furnished to the 
property by the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, 
or an instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing.
    (2) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. A owns Blackacre in the city of M. A notice of lien 
affecting Blackacre is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. 
Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, the city of M acquires a 
lien against Blackacre to secure payment of real estate taxes. Such 
taxes are levied against all property in the city in proportion to the 
value of the property. Under local law, the holder of a lien for real 
property taxes is entitled to priority over a security interest in real 
property even though the security interest is prior in time. Because the 
real property tax lien held by the city of M secures payment of a tax of 
general application and is entitled to priority over security interests 
which are prior in time, the lien held by the city of M is entitled to 
priority over the Federal tax lien with respect to Blackacre.

    Example 2. B owns Whiteacre in N county. A notice of lien affecting 
Whiteacre is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to 
the filing of the notice of lien, N county constructs a sidewalk, paves 
the street, and

[[Page 186]]

installs water and sewer lines adjacent to Whiteacre. In order to defray 
the cost of these improvements, N county imposes upon Whiteacre a 
special assessment which under local law results in a lien upon 
Whiteacre that is entitled to priority over security interests that are 
prior in time. Because the special assessment lien is (i) entitled under 
local law to priority over security interests which are prior in time, 
and (ii) imposed directly upon real property to defray the cost of a 
public improvement, the special assessment lien has priority over the 
Federal tax lien with respect to Whiteacre.

    Example 3. C owns Greenacre in town O. A notice of lien affecting 
Greenacre is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Town O 
furnishes water and electricity to Greenacre and periodically collects a 
fee for these services. Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, 
town O supplies water and electricity to Greenacre, and C fails to pay 
the charges for these services. Under local law, town O acquires a lien 
to secure charges for the services, and this lien has priority over 
security interests which are prior in time. Because the lien of town O 
(i) is for services furnished to the real property and (ii) has priority 
over earlier security interests, town O's lien has priority over the 
Federal tax lien with respect to Greenacre.

    (g) Residential property subject to a mechanic's lien for certain 
repairs and improvements--(1) In general. Even though a notice of a lien 
imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, 
the lien is not valid against a mechanic's lienor (as defined in 
Sec. 301.6323(h)-(b)) who holds a lien for the repair or improvement of 
a personal residence if--
    (i) The residence is occupied by the owner and contains no more than 
four dwelling units, and
    (ii) The contract price on the prime contract with the owner for the 
repair or improvement (excluding interest and expenses described in 
Sec. 301.6323(e)-1) is not more than $1,000.

For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the amounts of 
subcontracts under the prime contract with the owner are not to be taken 
into consideration for purposes of computing the $1,000 prime contract 
price. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the 
contractor undertakes his work or that he knew of the lien before 
undertaking the work.
    (2) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. A owns a building containing four apartments, one of 
which he occupies as his personal residence. A notice of lien which 
affects the building is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. 
Thereafter, A enters into a contract with B in the amount of $800, which 
includes labor and materials, to repair the roof of the building. B 
purchases roofing shingles from C for $300. B completes the work and A 
fails to pay B the agreed amount. In turn, B fails to pay C for the 
shingles. Under local law, B and C acquire mechanic's liens on A's 
building. Because the contract price on the prime contract with A is not 
more than $1,000 and under local law B and C acquire mechanic's liens on 
A's building, the liens of B and C have priority over the Federal tax 
lien.

    Example 2. Assume that same facts as in example 1, except that the 
amount of the prime contract between A and B is $1,100. Because the 
amount of the prime contract with the owner, A, is in excess of $1,000, 
the tax lien has priority over the entire amount of each of the 
mechanic's liens of B and C, even though the amount of the contract 
between B and C is $300.

    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that A and 
B do not agree in advance upon the amount due under the prime contract 
but agree that B will perform the work for the cost of materials and 
labor plus 10 percent of such cost. When the work is completed, it is 
determined that the total amount due is $850. Because the prime contract 
price is not more than $1,000 and under local law B and C acquire 
mechanic's liens on A's residence, the liens of B and C have priority 
over the Federal tax lien.

    (h) Attorney's liens--(1) In general. Even though notice of a lien 
imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, 
the lien is not valid against an attorney who, under local law, holds a 
lien upon, or a contract enforceable against, a judgment or other amount 
in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action. The priority afforded 
an attorney's lien under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount of 
the attorney's reasonable compensation for obtaining the judgment or 
procuring the settlement. For purposes of this paragraph, reasonable 
compensation means the amount customarily allowed under local law for an 
attorney's services for litigating or settling a similar case or 
administrative claim. However, reasonable compensation shall be 
determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each 
individual case. It is immaterial that the

[[Page 187]]

notice of tax lien is filed before the attorney undertakes his work or 
that the attorney knows of the tax lien before undertaking his work. 
This paragraph does not apply to an attorney's lien which may arise from 
the defense of a claim or cause of action against a taxpayer except to 
the extent such lien is held upon a judgment or other amount arising 
from the adjudication or settlement of a counterclaim in favor of the 
taxpayer. In the case of suits against the taxpayer, see Sec. 301.6325-
1(d)(2) for rules relating to the subordination of the tax lien to 
facilitate tax collection.
    (2) Claim or cause of action against the United States. Paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section does not apply to an attorney's lien with respect 
to--
    (i) Any judgment or other fund resulting from the successful 
litigation or settlement of an administrative claim or cause of action 
against the United States to the extent that the United States, under 
any legal or equitable right, offsets its liability under the judgment 
or settlement against any liability of the taxpayer to the United 
States, or
    (ii) Any amount credited against any liability of the taxpayer in 
accordance with section 6402.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. A notice of lien is filed against A in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequently, A is struck by an automobile and 
retains B, an attorney to institute suit on A's behalf against the 
operator of the automobile. B knows of the tax lien before he begins his 
work. Under local law, B is entitled to a lien upon any recovery in 
order to secure payment of his fee. A is awarded damages of $10,000. B 
charges a fee of $3,000 which is the fee customarly allowed under local 
law in similar cases and which is found to be reasonable under the 
circumstances of this particular case. Because, under local law, B holds 
a lien for the amount of his reasonable compensation for obtaining the 
judgment, B's lien has priority over the Federal tax lien.

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that before 
suit is instituted A and the owner of the automobile settle out of court 
for $7,500. B charges a reasonable and customary fee of $1,800 for 
procuring the settlement and under local law holds a lien upon the 
settlement in order to secure payment of the fee. Because, under local 
law, B holds a lien for the amount of his reasonable compensation for 
obtaining the settlement, B has priority over the Federal tax lien.

    Example 3. In accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien 
in the amount of $8,000 is filed against C, a contractor. Subsequently C 
retains D, an attorney, to initiate legal proceedings to recover the 
amount allegedly due him for construction work he has performed for the 
United States. C and D enter into an agreement which provides that D 
will receive a reasonable and customary fee of $2,500 as compensation 
for his services. Under local law, the agreement will give rise to a 
lien which is enforceable by D against any amount recovered in the suit. 
C is successful in the suit and is awarded $10,000. D claims $2,500 of 
the proceeds as his fee. The United States, however, exercises its right 
of set-off and applies $8,000 of the $10,000 award to satisfy C's tax 
liability. Because the $10,000 award resulted from the successful 
litigation of a cause of action against the United States, B's contract 
for attorney's fees is not enforceable against the amount recovered to 
the extent the United States offsets its liability under the judgment 
against C's tax liability. It is immaterial that D had no notice or 
knowledge of the tax lien at the time he began work on the case.

    (i) Certain insurance contracts--(1) In general. Even though a 
notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a life 
insurance, endowment, or annuity contract, against an organization which 
is the insurer under the contract, at any time--
    (1) Before the insuring organization has actual notice or knowledge 
(as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of 
the tax lien,
    (ii) After the insuring organization has actual notice or knowledge 
of the lien (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1), with 
respect to advances (including contractual interest thereon as provided 
in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(e)-1) required to be made 
automatically to maintain the contract in force under an agreement 
entered into before the insuring organization had such actual notice or 
knowledge, or
    (iii) After the satisfaction of a levy pursuant to section 6332(b), 
unless and until the district director delivers to the insuring 
organization a notice (for example, another notice of levy, a letter, 
etc.), executed after the date of such satisfaction, that the lien 
exists.


[[Page 188]]


Delivery of the notice described in subdivision (iii) of this 
subparagraph may be made by any means, including regular mail, and 
delivery of the notice shall be effective only from the time of actual 
receipt of the notification by the insuring organization. The provisions 
of this paragraph are applicable to matured as well as unmatured 
insurance contracts.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On May 1, 1964, the X insurance company issues a life 
insurance policy to A. On June 1, 1970, a tax assessment is made against 
A, and on June 2, 1970, a notice of lien with respect to the assessment 
is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. On July 1, 1970, without 
actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien, the X company makes a 
``policy loan'' to A. Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, the 
loan, including interest (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(a) of Sec. 301.6323(e)-1), will have priority over the tax lien because 
X company did not have actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien at the 
time the policy loan was made.

    Example 2. On May 1, 1964, B enters into a life insurance contract 
with the Y insurance company. Under one of the provisions of the 
contract, in the event a premium is not paid, Y is to advance out of the 
cash loan value of the policy the amount of an unpaid premium in order 
to maintain the contract in force. The contract also provides for 
interest on any advances so made. On June 1, 1971, a tax assessment is 
made against B, and on June 2, 1971, in accordance with section 6323(f)-
1, a notice of lien is filed. On July 1, 1971, B fails to pay the 
premium due on that date, and Y makes an automatic premium loan to keep 
the policy in force. At the time the automatic premium loan is made, Y 
had actual knowledge of the tax lien. Under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this 
paragraph, the lien is not valid against Y with respect to the advance 
(and the contractual interest thereon), because the advance was required 
to be made automatically under an agreement entered into before Y had 
actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien.

    Example 3. On May 1, 1964, C enters into a life insurance contract 
with the Z insurance company. On January 4, 1971, an assessment is made 
against C for $5,000 unpaid income taxes, and on January 11, 1971, in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. On 
January 29, 1971, a notice of levy with respect to C's delinquent tax is 
served on Z company. The amount which C could have had advanced to him 
from Z company under the contract on the 90th day after service of the 
notice of levy on Z company is $2,000. The Z company pays $2,000 
pursuant to the notice of levy, thereby satisfying the levy upon the 
contract in accordance with Sec. 6332(b). On February 1, 1973, Z company 
advances $500 to C, which is the increment in policy loan value since 
satisfaction of the levy of January 29, 1971. On February 5, 1973, a new 
notice of levy for the unpaid balance of the delinquent taxes, executed 
after the first levy was satisfied, is served upon Z company. Because 
the new notification was not received by Z company until after the 
policy loan was made, under paragraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, the 
tax lien is not valid against Z company with respect to the policy loan 
(including interest thereon in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 301.6323(e)-1).

    Example 4.  On June 1, 1973, a tax assessment is made against D and 
on June 2, 1973, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien 
with respect to the assessment is filed. On July 2, 1973, D executes an 
assignment of his rights, as the insured, under an insurance contract to 
M bank as security for a loan. M bank holds its security interest 
subject to the lien because it is not an insurer entitled to protection 
under section 6323(b)(9) and did not become a holder of the security 
interest prior to the filing of the notice of lien for purposes of 
section 6323(a). It is immaterial that a notice of levy had not been 
served upon the insurer before the assignment to M bank was made.

    (j) Passbook loans--(1) In general. Even though a notice of a lien 
imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, 
the lien is not valid against an institution described in section 581 or 
591 to the extent of any loan made by the institution which is secured 
by a savings deposit, share, or other account evidenced by a passbook 
(as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (j)) if the 
institution has been continuously in possession of the passbook from the 
time the loan is made. This paragraph applies only to a loan made 
without actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of the lien. Even though an 
original passbook loan is made without actual notice or knowledge of the 
existence of the lien, this paragraph does not apply to any additional 
loan made after knowledge of the lien is acquired by the institution 
even if it continues to retain the passbook from the time the original 
passbook loan is made.
    (2) Definition of passbook. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
``passbook'' includes--

[[Page 189]]

    (i) Any tangible evidence of a savings deposit, share, or other 
account which, when in the possession of the bank or other savings 
institution, will prevent a withdrawal from the account to the extent of 
the loan balance, and
    (ii) Any procedure or system, such as an automatic data processing 
system, the use of which by the bank or other savings institution will 
prevent a withdrawal from the account to the extent of the loan balance.

    (3) Example. On June 1, 1970, a tax assessment is made against A and 
on June 2, 1970, a notice of lien with respect to the assessment is 
filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. A owns a savings account at 
the M bank with a balance of $1,000. On June 10, 1970, A borrows $300 
from the M bank using the savings account as security therefor. The M 
bank is continuously in possession of the passbook from the time the 
loan is made and does not have actual notice or knowledge of the lien at 
the time of the loan. The tax lien is not valid against M bank with 
respect to the passbook loan of $300 and accrued interest and expenses 
entitled to priority under Sec. 301.6323(e)-1. Upon service of a notice 
of levy, the M bank must pay over the savings account balance in excess 
of the amount of its protected interest in the account as determined on 
the date of levy.

Sec. 301.6323(c)-1   Protection for commercial transactions financing agreements.

    (a) In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 
6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not 
valid with respect to a security interest which:
    (1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,
    (2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of a commercial 
transactions financing agreement entered into before the tax lien 
filing, and
    (3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as 
of the time of the tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.

See paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the 
terms ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing,'' respectively. For 
purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment 
lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1.
    (b) Commercial transactions financing agreement. For purposes of 
this section, the term ``commercial transactions financing agreement'' 
means a written agreement entered into by a person in the course of his 
trade or business--
    (1) To make loans to the taxpayer (whether or not at the option of 
the person agreeing to make such loans) to be secured by commercial 
financing security acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of 
his trade or business, or
    (2) To purchase commercial financing security, other than inventory, 
acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or 
business.

Such an agreement qualifies as a commercial transactions financing 
agreement only with respect to loans or purchases made under the 
agreement before (i) the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing or, 
(ii) the time when the lender or purchaser has actual notice or 
knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the tax 
lien filing, if earlier. For purposes of this paragraph, a loan or 
purchase is considered to have been made in the course of the lender's 
or purchaser's trade or business if such person is in the business of 
financing commercial transactions (such as a bank or commercial factor) 
of if the agreement is incidental to the conduct of such person's trade 
or business. For example, if a manufacturer finances the accounts 
receivable of one of his customers, he is considered to engage in such 
financing in the course of his trade or business. The extent of the 
priority of the lender or purchaser over the tax lien is the amount of 
his disbursements made before the 46th day after the date the notice of 
tax lien is filed, or made before the day (before such 46th day) on 
which the lender or purchaser has actual notice or knowledge of the 
filing of the notice of the tax lien.
    (c) Commercial financing security. (1) In general. The term 
``commercial financing security'' means--
    (i) Paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions.
    (ii) Accounts receivable (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph (c)),
    (iii) Mortgages on real property, and
    (iv) Inventory.


[[Page 190]]


For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``paper of a kind ordinarily 
arising in commercial transactions'' in general includes any written 
document customarily used in commercial transactions. For example, such 
written documents include paper giving contract rights (as defined in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)), chattel paper, documents of 
title to personal property, and negotiable instruments or securities. 
The term ``commercial financing security'' does not include general 
intangibles such as patents or copyrights. A mortgage on real estate 
(including a deed of trust, contract for sale, and similar instrument) 
may be commercial financing security if the taxpayer has an interest in 
the mortgage as a mortgagee or assignee. The term ``commercial financing 
security'' does not include a mortgage where the taxpayer is the 
mortgagor or realty owned by him. For purposes of this subparagraph, the 
term ``inventory'' includes raw materials and goods in process as well 
as property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the 
ordinary course of his trade or business.
    (2) Definitions. For purposes of Secs. 301.6323(d)-1, 301.6323(h)-1 
and this section--
    (i) A contract right is any right to payment under a contract not 
yet earned by performance and not evidenced by an instrument or chattel 
paper, and
    (ii) An account receivable is any right to payment for goods sold or 
leased or for services rendered which is not evidenced by an instrument 
or chattel paper.
    (d) Qualified property. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, qualified property consists solely of commercial financing 
security acquired by the taxpayer-debtor before the 46th day after the 
date of tax lien filing: Commercial financing security acquired before 
such day may be qualified property even though it is acquired by the 
taxpayer after the lender received actual notice or knowledge of the 
filing of the tax lien. For example, although the receipt of actual 
notice or knowledge of the filing of the notice of the tax lien has the 
effect of ending the period within which protected disbursements may be 
made to the taxpayer, property which is acquired by the taxpayer after 
the lender receives actual notice or knowledge of such filing and before 
such 46th day, which otherwise qualifies as commercial financing 
security, becomes commercial financing security to which the priority of 
the lender extends for loans made before he received the actual notice 
or knowledge. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section) is acquired by a taxpayer at the time, and to the 
extent, a right to payment is earned by performance. Chattel paper, 
documents of title, negotiable instruments, securities, and mortgages on 
real estate are acquired by a taxpayer when he obtains rights in the 
paper or mortgage. Inventory is acquired by the taxpayer when title 
passes to him. A contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section) is acquired by a taxpayer when the contract is made. 
Identifiable proceeds, which arise from the collection or disposition of 
qualified property by the taxpayer, are considered to be acquired at the 
time such qualified property is acquired if the secured party has a 
continuously perfected security interest in the proceeds under local 
law. The term ``proceeds'' includes whatever is received when collateral 
is sold, exchanged, or collected. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``identifiable proceeds'' does not include money, checks and the 
like which have been commingled with other cash proceeds. Property 
acquired by the taxpayer after the 45th day following tax lien filing, 
by the expenditure of proceeds, is not qualified property.
    (e) Purchaser treated as acquiring security interest. A person who 
purchases commercial financing security, other than inventory, pursuant 
to a commercial transactions financing agreement is treated, for 
purposes of this section, as having acquired a security interest in the 
commercial financing security. In the case of a bona fide purchase at a 
discount, a purchaser of commercial financing security who satisfies the 
requirements of this section has priority over the tax lien to the full 
extent of the security.

[[Page 191]]

    (f) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) On June 1, 1970, a tax is assessed against M, a tool 
manufacturer, with respect to his delinquent tax liability. On June 15, 
1970, M enters into a written financing agreement with X, a bank. The 
agreement provides that, in consideration of such sums as X may advance 
to M, X is to have a security interest in all of M's presently owned and 
subsequently acquired commercial paper, accounts receivable, and 
inventory (including inventory in the manufacturing stages and raw 
materials). On July 6, 1970, notice of the tax lien is filed in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. On August 3, 1970, without actual 
notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, X advances $10,000 to M. On 
August 5, 1970, M acquires additional inventory through the purchase of 
raw materials. On August 20, 1970, M has accounts receivable, arising 
from the sale of tools, amounting to $5,000. Under local law, X's 
security interest arising by reason of the $10,000 advance on August 3, 
1970, has priority, with respect to the raw materials and accounts 
receivable, over a judgment lien against M arising July 6, 1970 (the 
date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.
    (ii) Because the $10,000 advance was made before the 46th day after 
the tax lien filing, and the accounts receivable in the amount of $5,000 
and the raw materials were acquired by M before such 46th day, X's 
$10,000 security interest in the accounts receivable and the inventory 
has priority over the tax lien. The priority of X's security interest 
also extends to the proceeds, received on or after the 46th day after 
the tax lien filing, from the liquidation of the accounts receivable and 
inventory held by M on August 20, 1970, if X has a continuously 
perfected security interest in identifiable proceeds under local law. 
However, the priority of X's security interest will not extend to other 
property acquired with such proceeds.

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on July 
15, 1970, X has actual knowledge of the tax lien filing. Because an 
agreement does not qualify as a commercial transactions financing 
agreement when a disbursement is made after tax lien filing with actual 
knowledge of the filing, X's security interest will not have priority 
over the tax lien with respect to the $10,000 advance made on August 3, 
1970.

    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that, 
instead of additional inventory, on August 5, 1970, M acquires an 
account receivable as the result of the sale of machinery which M no 
longer needs in his business. Even though the account receivable was 
acquired by taxpayer M before the 46th day after tax lien filing, the 
tax lien will have priority over X's security interest arising in the 
account receivable pursuant to the earlier written agreement because the 
account receivable was not acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary 
course of his trade or business.

    Example 4.  Pursuant to a written agreement with the N Manufacturing 
Company entered into on January 4, 1971, Y a commercial factor, 
purchases the accounts receivable arising out of N's regular sales to 
its customers. On November 1, 1971, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-
1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to N's delinquent tax 
liability. On December 6, 1971, Y, without actual notice or knowledge of 
the tax lien filing, purchases all of the accounts receivable resulting 
from N's November 1971 sales. Y has taken appropriate steps under local 
law so that the December 6, 1971, purchase is protected against a 
judgment lien arising November 1, 1971 (the date of tax lien filing) out 
of an unsecured obligation. Because the purchaser of commercial 
financing security, other than inventory, is treated as having acquired 
a security interest in commercial financing security, and because Y 
otherwise meets the requirements of this section, the tax lien is not 
valid with respect to Y's December 6, 1971, purchase of N's accounts 
receivable.

Sec. 301.6323(c)-2   Protection for real property construction or improvement financing agreements.

    (a) In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 
6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not 
valid with respect to a security interest which:
    (1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,
    (2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of a real property 
construction or improvement financing agreement entered into before the 
tax lien filing, and
    (3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as 
of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.

For purposes of this section, it is immaterial that the holder of the 
security interest had actual notice or knowledge of the lien at the time 
disbursements are made pursuant to such an agreement. See paragraphs (a) 
and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for general definitions of the terms 
``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing.'' For purposes of this 
section, a judgment lien is a lien

[[Page 192]]

held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of 
Sec. 301.6323(h)-1.
    (b) Real property construction or improvement financing agreement. 
For purposes of this section, the term ``real property construction or 
improvement financing agreement'' means any written agreement to make 
cash disbursements (whether or not at the option of the party agreeing 
to make such disbursements):
    (1) To finance the construction, improvement, or demolition of real 
property if the agreement provides for a security interest in the real 
property with respect to which the construction, improvement, or 
demolition has been or is to be made;
    (2) To finance a contract to construct or improve, or demolish real 
property if the agreement provides for a security interest in the 
proceeds of the contract; or
    (3) To finance the raising or harvesting of a farm crop or the 
raising of livestock or other animals if the agreement provides for a 
security interest in any property subject to the lien imposed by section 
6321 at the time of tax lien filing, in the crop raised or harvested, or 
in the livestock or other animals raised.

For purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (b), 
construction or improvement may include demolition. For purposes of any 
agreement described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b), the 
furnishing of goods and services is treated as the disbursement of cash.
    (c) Qualified property. For purposes of this section, the term 
``qualified property'' includes only--
    (1) In the case of an agreement described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, the real property with respect to which the construction 
or improvement has been or is to be made;
    (2) In the case of an agreement described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, the proceeds of the contract to construct or improve real 
property; or
    (3) In the case of an agreement described in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section, property subject to the lien imposed by section 6321 at 
the time of tax lien filing, the farm crop raised or harvested, or the 
livestock or other animals raised.
    (d) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. A, in order to finance the construction of a dwelling on 
a lot owned by him, mortgages the property to B. The mortgage, executed 
January 4, 1971, includes an agreement that B will make cash 
disbursements to A as the construction progresses. On February 1, 1971, 
in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with 
respect to A's delinquent tax liability. A continues the construction, 
and B makes cash disbursements on June 10, 1971, and December 10, 1971. 
Under local law B's security interest arising by virtue of the 
disbursements is protected against a judgment lien arising February 1, 
1971 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. 
Because B is the holder of a security interest coming into existence by 
reason of cash disbursements made pursuant to a written agreement, 
entered into before tax lien filing, to make cash disbursements to 
finance the construction of real property, and because B's security 
interest is protected, under local law, against a judgment lien arising 
as of the time of tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, B's 
security interest has priority over the tax lien.

    Example 2. (i) C is awarded a contract for the demolition of several 
buildings. On March 3, 1969, C enters into a written agreement with D 
which provides that D will make cash disbursements to finance the 
demolition and also provides that repayment of the disbursements is 
secured by any sums due C under the contract. On April 1, 1969, in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with 
respect to C's delinquent tax liability. With actual notice of the tax 
lien, D makes cash disbursements to C on August 1, September 1, and 
October 1, 1969. Under local law D's security interest in the proceeds 
of the contract with respect to the disbursements is entitled to 
priority over a judgment lien arising on April 1, 1969 (the date of tax 
lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.
    (ii) Because D's security interest arose by reason of disbursements 
made pursuant to a written agreement, entered into before tax lien 
filing, to make cash disbursements to finance a contract to demolish 
real property, and because D's security interest is valid under local 
law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of tax lien filing 
out of an unsecured obligation, the tax lien is not valid with respect 
to D's security interest in the proceeds of the demolition contract.

    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 2 and, in addition, 
assume that, as further security for the cash disbursements, the March 
3, 1969 agreement also provides for a security interest in all of C's 
demolition

[[Page 193]]

equipment. Because the protection of the security interest arising from 
the disbursements made after tax lien filing under the agreement is 
limited under section 6323(c)(3) to the proceeds of the demolition 
contract and because, under the circumstances, the security interest in 
the equipment is not otherwise protected under section 6323, the tax 
lien will have priority over D's security interest in the equipment.

    Example 4. (i) On January 2, 1969, F and G enter into a written 
agreement, whereby F agrees to provide G with cash disbursements, seed, 
fertilizer, and insecticides as needed by G, in order to finance the 
raising and harvesting of a crop on a farm owned by G. Under the terms 
of the agreement F is to have a security interest in the crop, the farm, 
and all other property then owned or thereafter acquired by G. In 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, on January 10, 1969, a notice of 
lien is filed with respect to G's delinquent tax liability. On March 3, 
1969, with actual notice of the tax lien, F makes a cash disbursement of 
$5,000 to G and furnishes him seed, fertilizer, and insecticides having 
a value of $10,000. Under local law F's security interest, coming into 
existence by reason of the cash disbursement and the furnishing of 
goods, has priority over a judgment lien arising January 10, 1969 (the 
date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.
    (ii) Because F's security interest arose by reason of a disbursement 
(including the furnishing of goods) made under a written agreement which 
was entered into before tax lien filing and which constitutes an 
agreement to finance the raising or harvesting of a farm crop, and 
because F's security interest is valid under local law against a 
judgment lien arising as of the time of tax lien filing out of an 
unsecured obligation, the tax lien is not valid with respect to F's 
security interest in the crop even though a notice of lien was filed 
before the security interest arose. Furthermore, because the farm is 
property subject to the tax lien at the time of tax lien filing, F's 
security interest with respect to the farm also has priority over the 
tax lien.

    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in example 4 and in addition 
that on October 1, 1969, G acquires several tractors to which F's 
security interest attaches under the terms of the agreement. Because the 
tractors are not property subject to the tax lien at the time of tax 
lien filing, the tax lien has priority over F's security interest in the 
tractors.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6323(c)-3   Protection for obligatory disbursement agreements.

    (a) In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 
6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not 
valid with respect to a security interest which:
    (1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,
    (2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of an obligatory 
disbursement agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and
    (3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as 
of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.

See paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the 
terms ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing.'' For purposes of 
this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor 
as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1.
    (b) Obligatory disbursement agreement. For purposes of this section 
the term ``obligatory disbursement agreement'' means a written 
agreement, entered into by a person in the course of his trade or 
business, to make disbursements. An agreement is treated as an 
obligatory disbursement agreement only with respect to disbursements 
which are required to be made by reason of the intervention of the 
rights of a person other than the taxpayer. The obligation to pay must 
be conditioned upon an event beyond the control of the obligor. For 
example, the provisions of this section are applicable where an issuing 
bank obligates itself to honor drafts or other demands for payment on a 
letter of credit and a bank, in good faith, relies upon that letter of 
credit in making advances. The provisions of this section are also 
applicable, for example, where a bonding company obligates itself to 
make payments to indemnify against loss or liability and, under the 
terms of the bond, makes a payment with respect to a loss. The priority 
described in this section is not applicable, for example, in the case of 
an accommodation endorsement by an endorser who assumes his obligation 
other than in the course of his trade or business.
    (c) Qualified property. Except as provided under paragraph (d) of 
this section, the term ``qualified property,'' for purposes of this 
section, means property subject to the lien imposed by section 6321 at 
the time of tax lien filing and, to the extent that the acquisition

[[Page 194]]

is directly traceable to the obligatory disbursement, property acquired 
by the taxpayer after tax lien filing.
    (d) Special rule for surety agreements. Where the obligatory 
disbursement agreement is an agreement insuring the performance of a 
contract of the taxpayer and another person, the term ``qualified 
property'' shall be treated as also including--
    (1) The proceeds of the contract the performance of which was 
insured, and
    (2) If the contract the performance of which was insured is a 
contract to construct or improve real property, to produce goods, or to 
furnish services, any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in 
the performance of the insured contract.

For example, a surety company which holds a security interest, arising 
from cash disbursements made after tax lien filing under a payment or 
performance bond on a real estate construction project, has priority 
over the tax lien with respect to the proceeds of the construction 
contract and, in addition, with respect to any tangible personal 
property used by the taxpayer in the construction project if its 
security interest in the tangible personal property is protected under 
local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time the tax lien 
was filed, out of an unsecured obligation.
    (3) Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. (i) On January 2, 1969, H, an appliance dealer, in order 
to finance the acquisition from O of a large inventory of appliances, 
enters into a written agreement with Z, a bank. Under the terms of the 
agreement, in return for a security interest in all of H's inventory, 
presently owned and subsequently acquired, Z issues an irrevocable 
letter of credit to allow H to make the purchase. On December 31, 1968 
and January 10, 1969, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, separate 
notices of lien are filed with respect to H's delinquent tax 
liabilities. On March 31, 1969, Z honors the letter of credit. Under 
local law, Z's security interest in both existing and after-acquired 
inventory is protected against a judgment lien arising on or after 
January 10, 1969, out of an unsecured obligation. Under local law, Z's 
security interest in the inventory purchased under the letter of credit 
qualifies as a purchase money security interest and is valid against 
persons acquiring security interests in or liens upon such inventory at 
any time.
    (ii) Because Z's security interest in H's inventory did not arise 
under a written agreement entered into before the filing of notice of 
the first tax lien on December 31, 1968, that lien is superior to Z's 
security interest except to the extent of Z's purchase money security 
interest. Because Z's interest qualifies as a purchase money security 
interest with respect to the inventory purchased under the letter of 
credit, the tax liens attach under section 6321 only to the equity 
acquired by H, and the rights of Z in the inventory so purchased as 
superior even to the lien filed on December 31, 1968, without regard to 
this section.
    (iii) Because Z's security interest arose by reason of disbursements 
made under a written agreement which was entered into before the filing 
of notice of the second tax lien on January 10, 1969, and which 
constitutes an agreement to make disbursements required to be made by 
reason of the intervention of the rights of O, a person other than the 
taxpayer, and because Z's security interest is valid under local law 
against a judgment lien arising as of the time of such tax lien filing 
on January 10, 1969, out of an unsecured obligation, the second tax lien 
is, under this section, not valid with respect to Z's security interest 
in inventory owned by H on January 10, 1969, as well as any after-
acquired inventory directly traceable to Z's disbursements (apart from 
such greater protection as Z enjoys, with respect to the latter, under 
its purchase money security interest). No protection against the second 
tax lien is provided under this section with respect to a security 
interest in any other inventory acquired by H after January 10, 1969, 
because such other inventory is neither subject to the tax lien at the 
time of tax lien filing nor directly traceable to Z's disbursements.

    Example 2. On June 1, 1971, K is awarded a contract to construct an 
office building. At the same time, S, a surety company, agrees in 
writing to insure the performance of the contract. The agreement 
provides that in the event S must complete the job as the result of a 
default by K, S will be entitled to the proceeds of the contract. In 
addition, the agreement provides that S is to have a security interest 
in all property belonging to K. On December 1, 1971, prior to the 
completion of the building, K defaults. On the same date, under 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to K's 
delinquent tax liability. S completes the building on June 1, 1972. 
Under local law S's security interest in the proceeds of the contract 
and S's security interest in the property of K are entitled to priority 
over a judgment lien arising December 1, 1971 (the date of tax lien 
filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because, for purposes of an 
obligatory disbursement agreement which is a surety agreement, the 
security interest may be in the proceeds of the insured contract, S's 
security interest in the

[[Page 195]]

proceeds of the contract has priority over the tax lien even though a 
notice of lien was filed before S's security interest arose. 
Furthermore, because the insured contract was a contract to construct 
real property, S's security interest in any of K's tangible personal 
property used in the performance of the contract also has priority over 
the tax lien.

    Example 3. (i) On February 2, 1970, L enters into an agreement with 
M, a contractor, to construct an apartment building on land owned by L. 
Under a separate agreement, N bank agrees to furnish funds on a short-
term basis to L for the payment of amounts due to M during the course of 
construction. Simultaneously, X, a financial institution, makes a 
binding commitment to N bank and L to provide long-term financing for 
the project after its completion. Under its commitment, X is obligated 
to pay off the balance of the construction loan held by N bank upon the 
execution by L of a new promissory note secured by a mortgage deed of 
trust upon the improved property. On September 4, 1970, in accordance 
with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed with respect 
to L's delinquent tax liability. On September 8, 1970. X obtains actual 
notice of the tax lien filing. On September 14, 1970, the documents 
creating X's security interest are executed and recorded, N bank's lien 
for its construction loan is released, and X makes the required 
disbursements to N bank. Under local law, X's security interest is 
protected against a judgment lien arising on September 4, 1970 (the time 
of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.
    (ii) Because X's security interest arose by reason of a disbursement 
made under a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, 
which constitutes an agreement to make disbursements required to be made 
by reason of the intervention of the rights of N bank, a person other 
than the taxpayer, and because X's security interest is valid under 
local law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of the tax lien 
filing out of an unsecured obligation, the tax lien is not valid with 
respect to X's security interest to the extent of the disbursement to N 
bank. The obligatory disbursement is protected under section 6323(c)(4) 
even if X is not subrogated to N bank's rights or X's agreement is not 
itself a real property construction financing agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6323(d)-1   45-day period for making disbursements.

    (a) In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 
6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not 
valid with respect to a security interest which comes into existence, 
after tax lien filing, by reason of disbursements made before the 46th 
day after the date of tax lien filing, or if earlier, before the person 
making the disbursements has actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien 
filing, but only if the security interest is--
    (1) In property which is subject, at the time of tax lien filing, to 
the lien imposed by section 6321 and which is covered by the terms of a 
written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, and
    (2) Protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of 
the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.

For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), a contract right 
(as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is subject, at 
the time of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 if the 
contract has been made by such time. An account receivable (as defined 
in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is subject, at the time 
of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 if, and to the 
extent, a right to payment has been earned by performance at such time. 
For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a), a judgment lien 
is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) 
of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1. For purposes of this section, it is immaterial 
that the written agreement provides that the disbursements are to be 
made at the option of the person making the disbursements. See 
paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the 
terms ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing,'' respectively. See 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1 for certain circumstances under 
which a person is deemed to have actual notice or knowledge of a fact.
    (b) Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On December 1, 1967, an assessment is made against A with 
respect to his delinquent tax liability. On January 2, 1968, A enters 
into a written agreement with B whereby B agrees to lend A $10,000 in 
return for a security interest in certain property owned by A. On 
January 10, 1968, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1 notice of the 
tax lien affecting the property is filed. On February

[[Page 196]]

1, 1968, B, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, 
disburses the loan to A. Under local law, the security interest arising 
by reason of the disbursement is entitled to priority over a judgment 
lien arising January 10, 1968 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an 
unsecured obligation. Because the disbursement was made before the 46th 
day after tax lien filing, because the disbursement was made pursuant to 
a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, and because the 
resulting security interest is protected under local law against a 
judgment lien arising as of the date of tax lien filing out of an 
unsecured obligation, B's $10,000 security interest has priority over 
the tax lien.

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that when B 
disburses the $10,000 to A on February 10, 1968, B has actual knowledge 
of the tax lien filing. Because the disbursement was made with actual 
knowledge of tax lien filing, B's security interest does not have 
priority over the tax lien even though the disbursement was made before 
the 46th day after the tax lien filing. Furthermore, B is not protected 
under Sec. 301.6323(a)-1(a) as a holder of a security interest because 
he had not parted with money or money's worth prior to the time the 
notice of tax lien was filed (January 10, 1968) even though he had made 
a firm commitment to A before that time.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6323(e)-1  Priority of interest and expenses.

    (a) In general. If the lien imposed by section 6321 is not valid as 
against another lien or security interest, the priority of the other 
lien or security interest also extends to each of the following items to 
the extent that under local law the item has the same priority as the 
lien or security interest to which it relates:

    (1) Any interest or carrying charges (including finance, service, 
and similar charges) upon the obligation secured,
    (2) The reasonable charges and expenses of an indenture trustee 
(including, for example, the trustee under a deed of trust) or agent 
holding the security interest for the benefit of the holder of the 
security interest,
    (3) The reasonable expenses, including reasonable compensation for 
attorneys, actually incurred in collecting or enforcing the obligation 
secured,
    (4) The reasonable costs of insuring, preserving, or repairing the 
property to which the lien or security interest relates,
    (5) The reasonable costs of insuring payment of the obligation 
secured (including amounts paid by the holder of the security interest 
for mortgage insurance, such as that issued by the Federal Housing 
Administration), and
    (6) Amounts paid to satisfy any lien on the property to which the 
lien or security interest relates, but only if the lien so satisfied is 
entitled to priority over the lien imposed by section 6321.

    (b) Collection expenses. The reasonable expenses described in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section include expenditures incurred by the 
protected holder of the lien or security interest to establish the 
priority of his interest or to collect, by foreclosure or otherwise, the 
amount due him from the property subject to his lien. Accordingly, the 
amount of the encumbrance which is protected is increased by the amounts 
so expended by the holder of the security interest.
    (c) Costs of insuring, preserving, etc. The reasonable costs of 
insuring, preserving, or repairing described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section include expenditures by the holder of a security interest for 
fire and casualty insurance on the property subject to the security 
interest and amounts paid by the holder of the lien or security interest 
to repair the property. Such reasonable costs also include the amounts 
paid by the holder of the lien or security interest in a leasehold to 
the lessor of the leasehold to preseve the leasehold subject to the lien 
or security interest. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security 
interest which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by 
the holder of the lien or security interest.
    (d) Satisfaction of liens. The amounts described in paragraph (a)(6) 
of this section include expenditures incurred by the protected holder of 
a lien or security interest to discharge a statutory lien for State 
sales taxes on the property subject to his lien or security interest if 
both his lien or security interest and the sales tax lien have priority 
over a Federal tax lien. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security 
interest is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the 
lien or security interest even though under local law the holder of the 
lien or security interest is not subrogated to the rights of the holder 
of the State sales tax lien. However, if the holder of the lien or 
security interest is subrogated, within the meaning of paragraph (b) of

[[Page 197]]

Sec. 301.6323(i)-1, to the rights of the holder of the sales tax lien, 
he will also be entitled to any additional protection afforded by 
section 6323(i)(2).

[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35506, Aug. 23, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1  Place for filing notice; form.

    (a) Place for filing. The notice of lien referred to in 
Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed as follows:
    (1) Under State laws--(i) Real property. In the case of real 
property, notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the 
county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of 
the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated 
under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Personal property. In the case of personal property, whether 
tangible or intangible, the notice shall be filed in one office within 
the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as 
designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to 
the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) With the clerk of the United States district court. Whenever a 
State has not by law designated one office which meets the requirements 
of subparagraph (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this paragraph (a), the notice 
shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the U.S. district court for 
the judicial district in which the property subject to the lien is 
deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. 
For example, a State has not by law designated one office meeting the 
requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (a), if more than 
one office is designated within the State, county, or other governmental 
subdivision for filing notices with respect to all real property located 
in such State, county, or other governmental subdivision. A State has 
not by law designated one office meeting the requirements of 
subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (a), if more than one office is 
designated in the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for 
filing notices with respect to all of the personal property of a 
particular taxpayer. A state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal 
law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a 
designation by state law of an office for filing liens against personal 
property. Thus, if state law provides that a notice of lien affecting 
personal property must be filed in the office of the county clerk for 
the county in which the taxpayer resides and also adopts a federal law 
that requires a notice of lien to be filed in another location in order 
to attach to a specific type of property, the state is considered to 
have designated only one office for the filing of the notice of lien, 
and to protect its lien the Internal Revenue Service need only file its 
notice in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the 
taxpayer resides.
    (3) With the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia.  If the 
property subject to the lien imposed by section 5321 is deemed situated, 
under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, in the District 
of Columbia, the notice shall be filed in the office of the Recorder of 
Deeds of the District of Columbia.
    (b) Situs of property subject to lien. For purposes of paragraph (a) 
of this section, property is deemed situated as follows:
    (1) Real property. Real property is deemed situated at its physical 
location.
    (2) Personal property. Personal property, whether tangible or 
intangible, is deemed situated at the residence of the taxpayer at the 
time the notice of lien is filed.

For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b), the residence of 
a corporation or partnership is deemed to be the place at which the 
principal executive office of the business is located, and the residence 
of a taxpayer whose residence is not within the United States is deemed 
to be in the District of Columbia.
    (c) National filing system.  The filing of federal tax liens is to 
be governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to 
any other federal law that may establish a national system for filing 
liens and encumbrances against a particular type of personal property. 
Thus, for example, the Service is not subject to the requirements 
established by the Federal Aviation

[[Page 198]]

Agency for filing liens against civil aircraft in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma.
    (d) Form--(1) In general. The notice referred to in 
Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed on Form 668, ``Notice of Federal Tax 
Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws''. Such notice is valid notwithstanding 
any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of 
lien. For example, omission from the notice of lien of a description of 
the property subject to the lien does not affect the validity thereof 
even though State law may require that the notice contain a description 
of the property subject to the lien.
    (2) Form 668 defined. The term ``Form 668'' generally means a paper 
form. However, if a state in which a notice referred to in 
Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 is filed permits a notice of Federal tax lien to be 
filed by the use of an electronic or magnetic medium, the term ``Form 
668'' includes a Form 668 filed by the use of any electronic or magnetic 
medium permitted by that state. A Form 668 must identify the taxpayer, 
the tax liability giving rise to the lien, and the date the assessment 
arose regardless of the method used to file the notice of Federal tax 
lien.
    (e) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. The law of State X provides that notices of Federal tax 
lien affecting personal property are to be filed in the Office of the 
Recorder of Deeds of the county where the taxpayer resides. The laws of 
State X also provide that notices of lien affecting real property are to 
be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county where the real 
property is located. On June 1, 1970, in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed in county M with respect 
to the delinquent tax liability of A. At the time the notice is filed, A 
is a resident of county M and owns real property in that county. One 
year later A moves to county N and one year after that A moves to county 
O. Because the situs of personal property is deemed to be at the 
residence of the taxpayer at the time the notice of lien is filed, the 
notice continues to be effectively filed with respect to A's personal 
property even though A no longer resides in county M. Furthermore, 
because the situs of real property is deemed to be at its physical 
location, the notice of lien also continues to be effectively filed with 
respect to A's real property.

    Example 2. B is a resident of Canada but owns personal property in 
the United States. On January 4, 1971, in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with the Office of the 
Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia. On January 2, 1973, B 
changes his residence to State Y in the United States. Because the 
residence of a taxpayer who is not a resident of the United States is 
deemed to be in the District of Columbia and the situs of personal 
property is deemed to be at the residence of the taxpayer at the time of 
filing, the lien continues to be effectively filed with respect to the 
personal property of B located in the United States even though B has 
returned to the United States and taken up residence in State Y and even 
though B has at no time been in the District of Columbia.

    Example 3. The law of State Z in effect before July 1, 1967, 
provides that notices of lien affecting real property are to be filed in 
the office of the recorder of deeds of the county in which the real 
property is located, but that if the real property is registered under 
the Torrens system of title registration the notice is to be filed with 
the registrar of titles rather than the recorder of deeds. The law of 
State Z in effect after June 30, 1967, provides that all notices of lien 
affecting real property are to be filed with the recorder of deeds of 
the county in which the real property is located. Accordingly, where the 
Torrens system is adopted by a county in State Z, there were before July 
1, 1967, two offices designated for filing notices of Federal tax lien 
affecting real property in the county because one office was designated 
for Torrens real property and another office was designated for non-
Torrens real property. Because State Z had not designated one office 
within the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing 
notices before July 1, 1967, with respect to all real property located 
in the State, county, or governmental subdivision, before July 1, 1967, 
the place for filing notices of lien under this section, affecting 
property located in counties adopting the Torrens system, was with the 
clerk of the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the 
real property is located. However, after June 30, 1967, the place for 
filing notices of lien under this section, affecting both Torrens and 
non-Torrens real property in counties adopting the Torrens system is 
with the recorder of deeds for each such county. Notices of lien filed 
under this section with the clerk of the U.S. district court before July 
1, 1967, remain validly filed whether or not refiled with the recorder 
of deeds after the change in State law or upon refiling during the 
required refiling period.

    Example 4. The law of State W provides that notices of lien 
affecting personal property of corporations and partnerships are to be 
filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Notices of lien affecting 
personal property of any other person are to be filed in the office of 
the clerk of court for the

[[Page 199]]

county where the person resides. Because the State law designates only 
one filing office within State W with respect to personal property of 
any particular taxpayer, notices of lien filed under this section, 
affecting personal property, shall be filed in the office designated 
under State law.
    Example 5. The law of State F provides that notices of lien 
affecting personal property are to be filed with the clerk of the 
circuit court in the county in which the personal property is located. 
State F has conformed state law to federal law to provide that all 
instruments affecting title to an interest in any civil aircraft of the 
United States must be recorded in the Office of the Federal Aviation 
Administrator (FAA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On July 1, 1990, a tax 
lien arises against ABC airline, which owns aircraft situated in State 
F. The Internal Revenue Service files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien with 
the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the aircraft is 
located but does not file the notice with the FAA in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma. Because the FAA system adopted by State F does not constitute 
a second place of filing pursuant to section 6323(f), the federal tax 
lien is validly filed.
    Example 6. Assume the same facts as Example 5 except that State F 
did not reenact or conform state law to the FAA requirements. The result 
is the same because the filing of federal tax liens is governed solely 
by the Internal Revenue Code, and is not subject to any other national 
filing system.

Sec. 301.6323(g)-1  Refiling of notice of tax lien.

    (a) In general--(1) Requirement to refile. In order to continue the 
effect of a notice of lien, the notice must be refiled in the place 
described in paragraph (b) of this section during the required refiling 
period (described in paragraph (c) of this section). In the event that 
two or more notices of lien are filed with respect to a particular tax 
assessment, the failure to comply with the provisions of paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) and (c) of this section in respect of one of the notices of 
lien does not affect the effectiveness of the refiling of any other 
notice of lien. Except for the filing of a notice of lien required by 
paragraph (bb)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to a change of 
residence) the validity of any refiling of a notice of lien is not 
affected by the refiling or nonrefiling of any other notice of lien.
    (2) Effect of refiling. A timely refiled notice of lien is effective 
as of the date on which the notice of lien to which it relates was 
effective.
    (3) Effect of failure to refile If the district director fails to 
refile a notice of lien in the manner described in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, the notice of lien is not effective, after the 
expiration of the required refiling period, as against any person 
without regard to when the interest of the person in the property 
subject to the lien was acquired. However, the failure of the district 
director to refile a notice of lien during the required refiling period 
will not, following the expiration of the refiling period, affect the 
effectiveness of the notice with respect to:
    (i) Property which is the subject matter of a suit, to which the 
United States is a party, commenced prior to the expiration of the 
required refiling period, or
    (ii) Property which has been levied upon by the United States prior 
to the expiration of the refiling period.

However, if a suit or levy referred to in the preceding sentence is 
dismissed or released and the property is subject to the lien at such 
time, a notice of lien with respect to the property is not effective 
after the suit or levy is dismissed or released unless refiled during 
the required refiling period. Failure to refile a notice of lien does 
not affect the existence of the lien.
    (4) Filing of new notice. If a notice of lien is not refiled, and if 
the lien remains in existence, the Internal Revenue Service may 
nevertheless file a new notice of lien either on the form prescribed for 
the filing of a notice of lien or on the form prescribed for refiling a 
notice of lien. This new filing must meet the requirements of section 
6323(f) and Sec. 301.6323(f)-1 and is effective from the date on which 
such filing is made. I11(b) Place for refiling notice of lien--(1) In 
general. A notice of lien refiled during the required refiling period 
(described in paragraph (c) of this section) shall be effective only--
    (i) If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the 
prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was

[[Page 200]]

filed under the provisions of section 6323; and
    (ii) In any case in which 90 days or more prior to the date the 
refiling of the notice of lien under subdivision (i) is completed, the 
Internal Revenue Service receives written information (in the manner 
described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)) concerning a change 
in the taxpayer's residence, if a notice of such lien is also filed in 
accordance with section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii) in the State in which such new 
residence is located (or, if such new residence is located without the 
United States, in the District of Columbia).

A notice of lien is considered as refiled in the office in which the 
prior notice or refiled notice was filed under the provisions of section 
6323 if it is refiled in the office which, pursuant to a change in the 
applicable local law, assumed the functions of the office in which the 
prior notice or refiled notice was filed. If on or before the 90th day 
referred to in subdivision (ii) more than one written notice is received 
concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, a notice of lien is 
required by this subdivision to be filed only with respect to the 
residence shown on the written notice received on the most recent date. 
Subdivision (ii) is applicable regardless of whether the taxpayer 
resides at the new residence on the date the refiling of notice of lien 
under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is completed.
    (2) Notice of change of taxpayer's residence--(i) In general. Except 
as provided in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, for 
purposes of this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence 
will be effective only if it (A) is received, in writing, from the 
taxpayer or his representative by the district director or the service 
center director having jurisdiction where the original notice of lien 
was filed, (B) relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and 
(C) states the taxpayer's name and the address of his new residence. 
Although it is not necessary that a written notice contain the 
taxpayer's identifying number authorized by section 6109, it is 
preferable that it include such number. For purposes of this 
subdivision, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence shown on a 
return or an amended return (including a return of the same tax) will 
not be effective to notify the Internal Revenue Service.
    (ii) Notice received before August 23, 1976. For purposes of this 
section, a notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence will also be 
effective if it (A) is received, in writing, by any office of the 
Internal Revenue Service before August 23, 1976, from the taxpayer or 
his representative, (B) relates to an unpaid tax liability of the 
taxpayer, and (C) states the taxpayer's name and the address of his new 
residence.
    (iii) By return or amended return. For purposes of this section, in 
the case of a notice of lien which relates to an assessment of tax made 
after December 31, 1966, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence 
will also be effective if it is contained in a return or amended return 
of the same type of tax filed with the Internal Revenue Service by the 
taxpayer or his representative which on its face indicates that there is 
a change in the taxpayer's address and correctly states the taxpayer's 
name, the address of his new residence, and his identifying number 
required by section 6109.
    (iv) Other rules applicable. Except as provided in subdivisions (i), 
(ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph, no communication (either written 
or oral) to the Internal Revenue Service will be considered effective as 
notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence under this section, whether 
or not the Service has actual notice or knowledge of the taxpayer's new 
residence. For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of 
change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the 
notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received 
by the Internal Revenue Service without reference to the provisions of 
section 7502.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M and 
owns real property in State N. In accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, 
notices of lien are filed in States M and N. In order to continue the 
effect of the notice of lien filed in M, the Internal Revenue Service 
must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien 
with the appropriate office in M but is not required to refile the

[[Page 201]]

notice of lien with the appropriate office in N. Similarly, in order to 
continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in State N, the Internal 
Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the 
notice of lien with the appropriate office in N but is not required to 
refile the notice of lien with the appropriate office in M.

    Example 2. B, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M. In 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed in 
that State. One year before the beginning of the required refiling 
period, B establishes his residence in State N, and B immediately 
notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In 
order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in M, the 
Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling 
period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in M, and (ii) 
the appropriate office in N, because B properly notified the Internal 
Revenue Service of his change in residence to N more than 89 days prior 
to the date refiling of the notice of lien in M is completed. Even if 
the Internal Revenue Service had acquired actual notice or knowledge of 
B's change in residence by other means, if B had not properly notified 
the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence, the effect of 
the notice of lien in State M could have been continued without any 
refiling in State N.

    Example 3. C, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State O. In 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed in 
that State. Four years before the required refiling period, C 
establishes his residence in State P, and C immediately notifies the 
Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Three years before 
the required refiling period, C establishes his residence in State R, 
and again C immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his 
change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) 
of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien 
filed in O, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the 
required refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate 
office in O, and (ii) the appropriate office in R. Refiling in R is 
required because the notice received by the Service of C's change in 
residence to R was the most recent notice received more than 89 days 
prior to the date refiling in O is completed. The notice of lien is not 
required to be filed in P, even though C properly notified the Internal 
Revenue Service of his change in residence to P, because such notice is 
not the most recent one received.

    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C does 
not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to R 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 
In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, the 
Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling 
period, the notice of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O, and 
(ii) the appropriate office in P. Refiling in P is required because C 
properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in 
residence to P, even though C is not a resident of P on the date 
refiling of the notice of lien in O is completed. The Internal Revenue 
Service is not required to file a notice of lien in R because C did not 
properly notify the Service of his change in residence to R.

    Example 5. D, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M and 
owns real property in States N and O. In accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the Internal Revenue Service files notices of lien 
in M, N, and O States. Five years and 6 months after the date of the 
assessment shown on the notice of lien, D establishes his residence in 
P, and at that time the Internal Revenue Service received from D a 
notification of his change in residence in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. On a date which is 5 
years and 7 months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice 
of lien, the Internal Revenue Servbice properly refiles notices of lien 
in M, N, and O which refilings are sufficient to continue the effect of 
each of the notice of lien. The Internal Revenue Service is not required 
to file a notice of lien in P because D did not notify the Internal 
Revenue Service of his change of residence to P more than 89 days prior 
to the date each of the refilings in M, N, and O was completed.

    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that the 
refiling of the notice of lien in O occurs 100 days after D notifies the 
Internal Revenue Service of hischange in residence to P in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In order to 
continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, in addition to 
refiling the notice of lien in O, the Internal Revenue Service must also 
refile, during the required refiling period, a notice of lien in P 
because D properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change 
of residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date the refiling in O 
was completed. However, the Internal Revenue Service is not required to 
refile the notice of lien in P to maintain the effect of the notices of 
lien in M and N because D did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of 
his change in residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date the 
refilings in M and N were completed.

    Example 7. E, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State T. 
Because T has not designated one office in the case of personal property 
for filing notices of lien in accordance with the provisions of section 
6323(f)(1)(A)(ii), the Internal Revenue Service

[[Page 202]]

properly files a notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United 
States district court. However, solely as a matter of convenience for 
those who may have occasion to search for notices of lien, and not as a 
matter of legal effectiveness, the Internal Revenue Service also files 
notice of lien with the recorder of deeds of the county in T where E 
resides. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service sends a copy of the 
notice of lien to the X life insurance company to give the company 
actual notice of the notice of lien. In order to continue the effect of 
the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service must refile the notice 
of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district court 
during the required refiling period. In order to continue the effect of 
the notice of the lien, it is not necessary to refile the notice of lien 
with the Recorder of Deeds of the county where E resides, because the 
refiling of the notice of lien with the recorder of deeds does not 
constitute a proper filing for the purposes of section 6323(f). In 
addition, to continue the effect of the notice of lien under this 
section it is not necessary to send a copy of the notice of lien to the 
X life insurance company, because the sending of a notice of lien to an 
insurance company does not constitute a proper filing for the purposes 
of section 6323(f).

    (c) Required refiling period--(1) In general. For the purpose of 
this section, except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
(c), the term ``required refiling period'' means--
    (i) The 1-year period ending 30 days after the expiration of 6 years 
after the date of the assessment of the tax, and
    (ii) The 1-year period ending with the expiration of 6 years after 
the close of the preceding required refiling period for such notice of 
lien.
    (2) Tax assessments made before January 1, 1962. If the assessment 
of the tax is made before January 1, 1962, the first required refiling 
period shall be the calendar year 1967. Thus, to maintain the 
effectiveness of any notice of lien on file which relates to a lien 
which arose before January 1, 1962, the Internal Revenue Service will 
refile the notice of lien during the calendar year 1967.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On March 1, 1963, an assessment of tax is made against B, 
a delinquent taxpayer, and a lien for the amount of the assessment 
arises on that date. On July 1, 1963, in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. The notice of lien filed 
on July 1, 1963, is effective through March 31, 1969. The first required 
refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 1, 1968, and ends 
on March 31, 1969. A refiling of the notice of lien during that period 
will extend the effectiveness of the notice of lien filed on July 1, 
1963, through March 31, 1975. The second required refiling period for 
the notice of lien begins on April 1, 1974, and ends of March 31, 1975.

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that 
although the Internal Revenue Service fails to refile a notice of lien 
during the first required refiling period (April 1, 1963, through March 
31, 1969), a notice of lien is filed on June 2, 1971, in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Because of this filing, the notice of lien filed on 
June 2, 1971, is effective as of June 2, 1971. That notice must be 
refiled during the 1-year period ending on March 31, 1975, if it is to 
continue in effect after March 31, 1975.

    Example 3. On April 1, 1960, an assessment of tax is made against B, 
a delinquent taxpayer, and a tax lien for the amount of the assessment 
arises on that date. On June 1, 1962, in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. Because the assessment of 
tax was made before January 1, 1962, the notice of lien filed on June 1, 
1962, is effective through December 31, 1967. The first required 
refiling period for the notice of lien is the calendar year 1967. A 
refiling of the notice of lien during 1967 will extend the effectiveness 
of the notice of lien filed on June 1, 1962, through December 31, 1973.

    Except as otherwise provided by Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 the definitions

[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35509, Aug. 23, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6323(h)-1  Definitions.

    (a) Security interest--(1) In general. The term ``security 
interest'' means any interest in property acquired by contract for the 
purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation or 
indemnifying against loss or liability. A security interest exists at 
any time--
    (i) If, at such time, the property is in existence and the interest 
has become protected under local law against a subsequent judgment lien 
(as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a)) arising out of 
an unsecured obligation; and

[[Page 203]]

    (ii) To the extent that, at such time, the holder has parted with 
money or money's worth (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph 
(a)).

For purposes of this subparagraph, a contract right (as defined in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is in existence when the 
contract is made. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is in existence when, and to the 
extent, a right to payment is earned by performance.

A security interest must be in existence, within the meaning of this 
paragraph, at the time as of which its priority against a tax lien is 
determined. For example, to be afforded priority under the provisions of 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 a security interest must be in 
existence within the meaning of this paragraph before a notice of lien 
is filed.
    (2) Protection against a subsequent judgment lien. (i) For purposes 
of this paragraph, a security interest is deemed to be protected against 
a subsequent judgment lien on--
    (A) The date on which all actions required under local law to 
establish the priority of a security interest against a judgment lien 
have been taken, or
    (B) If later, the date on which all required actions are deemed 
effective, under local law, to establish the priority of the security 
interest against a judgment lien.

For purposes of this subdivision, the dates described in (A) and (B) of 
this subdivision (i) shall be determined without regard to any rule or 
principle of local law which permits the relation back of any requisite 
action to a date earlier than the date on which the action is actually 
performed. For purposes of this paragraph, a judgment lien is a lien 
held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. (i) Under the law of State X, a security interest in 
negotiable instruments, stocks, bonds, or other securities may be 
perfected, and hence protected against a judgment lien, only by the 
secured party taking possession of the instruments or securities. 
However, a security interest in such intangible personal property is 
considered to be temporarily perfected for a period of 21 days from the 
time the security interest attaches, to the extent consideration other 
than past consideration is given under a written security agreement. 
Under the law of X, a security interest attaches to such collateral when 
there is an agreement between the creditor and debtor that the interest 
attaches, the debtor has rights in the property, and consideration is 
given by the creditor. Under the law of X, in the case of temporary 
perfection, the security interest in such property is protected during 
the 21-day period against a judgment lien arising, after the security 
interest attaches, out of an unsecured obligation. Upon expiration of 
the 21-day period, the holder of the security interest must take 
possession of the collateral to continue perfection.
    (ii) Because the security interest is protected during the 21-day 
period against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured 
obligation, and because the taking of possession before the conclusion 
of the period of temporary perfection is not considered, for purposes of 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, to be a requisite action which 
relates back to the beginning of such period, the requirements of this 
paragraph are satisfied. However, because taking possession is a 
condition precedent to continued perfection, possession of the 
collateral is a requisite action to establish such priority after 
expiration of the period of temporary perfection. If there is a lapse of 
perfection for failure to take possession, the determination of when the 
security interest exists (for purposes of protection against the tax 
lien) is made without regard to the period of temporary perfection.

    (3) Money or money's worth. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
``money or money's worth'' includes money, a security (as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section), tangible or intangible property, 
services, and other consideration reducible to a money value. Money or 
money's worth also includes any consideration which otherwise would 
constitute money or money's worth under the preceding sentence which was 
parted with before the security interest would otherwise exist if, under 
local law, past consideration is sufficient to support an agreement 
giving rise to a security interest. A relinquishing or promised 
relinquishment of dower, curtesy, or of a statutory estate created in 
lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other marital rights is not a 
consideration in money or money's worth. Nor is love and affection,

[[Page 204]]

promise of marriage, or any other consideration not reducible to a money 
value a consideration in money or money's worth.
    (4) Holder of a security interest. For purposes of this paragraph, 
the holder of a security interest is the person in whose favor there is 
a security interest. For provisions relating to the treatment of a 
purchaser of commercial financing security as a holder of a security 
interest, see Sec. 301.6323(c)-1(e).
    (b) Mechanic's lienor--(1) In general. The term ``mechanic's 
lienor'' means any person who under local law has a lien on real 
property (or on the proceeds of a contract relating to real property) 
for services, labor, or materials furnished in connection with the 
construction or improvement (including demolition) of the property. A 
mechanic's lienor is treated as having a lien on the later of--
    (i) The date on which the mechanic's lien first becomes valid under 
local law against subsequent purchasers of the real property without 
actual notice, or
    (ii) The date on which the mechanic's lienor begins to furnish the 
services, labor, or materials.
    (2) Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. On February 1, 1968, A lets a contract for the construction 
of an office building on property owned by him. On March 1, 1968, in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien for delinquent 
Federal taxes owed by A is filed. On April 1, 1968, B, a lumber dealer, 
delivers lumber to A's property. On May 1, 1968, B records a mechanic's 
lien against the property to secure payment of the price of the lumber. 
Under local law, B's mechanic's lien is valid against subsequent 
purchasers of real property without notice from February 1, 1968, which 
is the date the construction contract was entered into. Because the date 
on which B's mechanic's lien is valid under local law against subsequent 
purchasers is February 1, and the date on which B begins to furnish the 
materials is April 1, the date on which B becomes a mechanic's lienor 
within the meaning of this paragraph is April 1, the later of these two 
dates. Under paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(a)-1, B's mechanic's lien 
will not have priority over the Federal tax lien, even though under 
local law the mechanic's lien relates back to the date of the contract.

    (c) Motor vehicle. (1) The term ``motor vehicle'' means a self-
propelled vehicle which is registered for highway use under the laws of 
any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country.
    (2) A motor vehicle is ``registered for highway use'' at the time of 
a sale if immediately prior to the sale it is so registered under the 
laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country. Where 
immediately prior to the sale of a motor vehicle by a dealer, the dealer 
is permitted under local law to operate it under a dealer's tag, 
license, or permit issued to him, the motor vehicle is considered to be 
registered for highway use in the name of the dealer at the time of the 
sale.
    (d) Security. The term ``security'' means any bond, debenture, note, 
or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by a 
corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof, with 
interest coupons or in registered form, share of stock, voting trust 
certificate, or any certificate of interest or participation in, 
certificate of deposit or receipt for, temporary or interim certificate 
for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the 
foregoing; negotiable instrument; or money.
    (e) Tax lien filing. The term ``tax lien filing'' means the filing 
of notice of the lien imposed by section 6321 in accordance with 
Sec. 301.6323(f)-1.
    (f) Purchaser--(1) In general. The term ``purchaser'' means a person 
who, for adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth (as 
defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (f)), acquires an interest 
(other than a lien or security interest) in property which is valid 
under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.
    (2) Interest in property. For purposes of this paragraph, each of 
the following interest is treated as an interest in property, if it is 
not a lien or security interest:
    (i) A lease of property,
    (ii) A written executory contract to purchase or lease property,
    (iii) An option to purchase or lease property and any interest 
therein, or
    (iv) An option to renew or extend a lease of property.
    (3) Adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the term ``adequate

[[Page 205]]

and full consideration in money or money's worth'' means a consideration 
in money or money's worth having a reasonable relationship to the true 
value of the interest in property acquired. See paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section for definition of the term ``money or money's worth.'' Adequate 
and full consideration in money or money's worth may include the 
consideration in a bona fide bargain purchase. The term also includes 
the consideration in a transaction in which the purchaser has not 
completed performance of his obligation, such as the consideration in an 
installment purchase contract, even though the purchaser has not 
completed the installment payments.
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. A enters into a contract for the purchase of a house and 
lot from B. Under the terms of the contract A makes a down payment and 
is to pay the balance of the purchase price in 120 monthly installments. 
After payment of the last installment, A is to receive a deed to the 
property. A enters into possession, which under local law protects his 
interest in the property against subsequent purchasers without actual 
notice. After A has paid five monthly installments, a notice of lien for 
Federal taxes is filed against B in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. 
Because the contract is an executory contract to purchase property and 
is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual 
notice, A qualifies as a purchaser under this paragraph.

    Example 2. C owns a residence which he leases to his son-in-law, D, 
for a period of 5 years commencing January 1, 1968. The lease provides 
for payment of $100 a year, although the fair rental value of the 
residence is $2,500 a year. The lease is recorded on December 31, 1967. 
On March 1, 1968, a notice of tax lien for unpaid Federal taxes of C is 
filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Under local law, D's 
interest is protected against subsequent purchasers without actual 
notice. However, because the rental paid by D has no reasonable 
relationship to the value of the interest in property acquired, D does 
not qualify as a purchaser under this paragraph.

    (g) Judgment lien creditor. The term ``judgment lien creditor'' 
means a person who has obtained a valid judgment, in a court of record 
and of competent jurisdiction, for the recovery of specifically 
designated property or for a certain sum of money. In the case of a 
judgment for the recovery of a certain sum of money, a judgment lien 
creditor is a person who has perfected a lien under the judgment on the 
property involved. A judgment lien is not perfected until the identity 
of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the 
lien are established. Accordingly, a judgment lien does not include an 
attachment or garnishment lien until the lien has ripened into judgment, 
even though under local law the lien of the judgment relates back to an 
earlier date. If recording or docketing is necessary under local law 
before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring 
liens on real property, a judgment lien under such local law is not 
perfected with respect to real property until the time of such 
recordation or docketing. If under local law levy or seizure is 
necessary before a judgment lien becomes effective against third parties 
acquiring liens on personal property, then a judgment lien under such 
local law is not perfected until levy or seizure of the personal 
property involved. The term ``judgment'' does not include the 
determination of a quasi-judicial body or of an individual acting in a 
quasi-judicial capacity such as the action of State taxing authorities.

[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35511, Aug. 23, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6323(i)-1  Special rules.

    (a) Actual notice or knowledge. For purposes of subchapter C 
(section 6321 and following), chapter 64 of the Code, an organization is 
deemed, in any transaction, to have actual notice or knowledge of any 
fact from the time the fact is brought to the attention of the 
individual conducting the transaction, and in any event from the time 
the fact would have been brought to the individual's attention if the 
organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due 
diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating 
significant information to the person conducting the transaction and 
there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not 
require an individual acting for the organization to communicate 
information unless such communication is part of his regular duties or 
unless he has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction

[[Page 206]]

would be materially affected by the information.
    (b) Subrogation--(1) In general. Where, under local law, one person 
is subrogated to the rights of another with respect to a lien or 
interest, such person shall be subrogated to such rights for purposes of 
any lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324. Thus, if a tax lien imposed by 
section 6321 or 6324 is not valid with respect to a particular interest 
as against the holder of that interest, then the tax lien also is not 
valid with respect to that interest as against any person who, under 
local law, is a successor in interest to the holder of that interest.
    (2) Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. On February 1, 1968, an assessment is made and a tax lien 
arises with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. On February 25, 
1968, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is 
properly filed. On March 1, 1968, A negotiates a loan from B, the 
security for which is a second mortgage on property owned by A. The 
first mortgage on the property is held by C and has priority over the 
tax lien. Upon default by A, C begins proceedings to foreclose upon the 
first mortgage. On September 1, 1968, B pays the amount of principal and 
interest in default to C in order to protect the second mortgage against 
the pending foreclosure of C's senior mortgage. Under local law, B is 
subrogated to C's rights to the extent of the payment to C. Therefore, 
the tax lien is invalid against B to the extent he became subrogated to 
C's rights even though the tax lien is valid against B's second mortgage 
on the property.

    (c) Disclosure of amount of outstanding lien. If a notice of lien 
has been filed (see Sec. 301.6323(f)-1), the amount of the outstanding 
obligation secured by the lien is authorized to be disclosed as a matter 
of public record on Form 668 ``Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal 
Revenue Laws.'' The amount of the outstanding obligation secured by the 
lien remaining unpaid at the time of an inquiry is authorized to be 
disclosed to any person who has a proper interest in determining this 
amount. Any person who has a right in the property or intends to obtain 
a right in the property by purchase or otherwise will, upon presentation 
by him of satisfactory evidence be considered to have a proper interest. 
Any person desiring this information may make his request to the office 
of the Internal Revenue Service named on the notice of lien with respect 
to which the request is made. The request should clearly describe the 
property subject to the lien, identify the applicable lien, and give the 
reasons for requesting the information.

Sec. 301.6324-1   Special liens for estate and gift taxes; personal liability of transferees and others.

    (a) Estate tax. (1) A lien for estate tax attaches at the date of 
the decedent's death to every part of the gross estate, whether or not 
the property comes into possession of the duly qualified executor or 
administrator. The lien attaches to the extent of the tax shown to be 
due by the return and of any deficiency in tax found to be due upon 
review and audit. If the estate tax is not paid when due, then the 
spouse, transferee, trustee (except the trustee of an employee's trust 
which meets the requirements of section 401(a)), surviving tenant, 
person in possession of the property by reason of the exercise, 
nonexercise, or release of a power of appointment, or beneficiary, who 
receives, or has on the date of the decedent's death, property included 
in the gross estate under sections 2034 to 2042, inclusive, shall be 
personally liable for the tax to the extent of the value, at the time of 
the decedent's death, of the property.
    (2) Unless the tax is paid in full or becomes unenforceable by 
reason of lapse of time, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, the lien upon the entire property constituting the 
gross estate continues for a period of 10 years after the decedent's 
death, except that the lien shall be divested with respect to--
    (i) The portion of the gross estate used for the payment of charges 
against the estate and expenses of its administration allowed by any 
court having jurisdiction thereof;
    (ii) Property included in the gross estate under sections 2034 to 
2042, inclusive, which is transferred by (or transferred by the 
transferee of) the spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, person 
in possession of the property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or

[[Page 207]]

release of a power of appointment, or beneficiary to a purchaser or 
holder of a security interest. In such case a like lien attaches to all 
the property of the spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, 
person in possession, beneficiary, or transferee of any such person, 
except the part which is transferred to a purchaser or a holder of a 
security interest. See section 6323(h) (1) and (6) and the regulations 
thereunder, respectively, for the definitions of ``security interest'' 
and ``purchaser'';
    (iii) The portion of the gross estate (or any interest therein) 
which has been transferred to a purchaser or holder of a security 
interest if payment is made of the full amount of tax determined by the 
district director pursuant to a request of the fiduciary (executor, in 
the case of the estate of a decedent dying before January 1, 1971) for 
discharge from personal liability as authorized by section 2204 
(relating to discharge of fiduciary from personal liability) but there 
is substituted a like lien upon the consideration received from the 
purchaser or holder of a security interest; and
    (iv) Property as to which the district director has issued a 
certificate releasing a lien under section 6325(a) and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (b) Lien for gift tax. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, a lien attaches upon all gifts made during the period for which 
the return was filed (see Sec. 25.6019-1 of this chapter) for the amount 
of tax imposed upon the gifts made during such period. The lien extends 
for a period of 10 years from the time the gifts are made, unless the 
tax is sooner paid in full or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse 
of time. If the tax is not paid when due, the donee of any gift becomes 
personally liable for the tax to the extent of the value of his gift. 
Any part of the property comprised in the gift transferred by the donee 
(or by a transferee of the donee) to a purchaser or holder of a security 
interest is divested of the lien, but a like lien, to the extent of the 
value of the gift, attaches to all the property (including after-
acquired property) of the donee (or the transferee) except any part 
transferred to a purchaser or holder of a security interest. See section 
6323(h) (1) and (6) and the regulations thereunder, respectively, for 
the definitions of ``security interest'' and ``purchaser.''
    (c) Exceptions. (1) A lien described in either paragraph (a) or 
paragraph (b) of this section is not valid against a mechanic's lienor 
(as defined in section 6323(h) (2) and the regulations thereunder) and, 
subject to the conditions set forth under section 6323(b) (relating to 
protection for certain interests even though notice filed), is not valid 
with respect to any lien or interest described in section 6323(b) and 
the regulations thereunder.
    (2) If a lien described in either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of 
this section is not valid against a lien or security interest (as 
defined in section 6323(h) (1) and the regulations thereunder), the 
priority of the lien or security interest extends to any item described 
in section 6323(e) (relating to priority of interest and expenses) to 
the extent that, under local law, the item has the same priority as the 
lien or security interest to which it relates.
    (d) Application of lien imposed by section 6321. The general lien 
under section 6321 and the special lien under subsection (a) or (b) of 
section 6324 for the estate or gift tax are not exclusive of each other, 
but are cumulative. Each lien will arise when the conditions precedent 
to the creation of such lien are met and will continue in accordance 
with the provisions applicable to the particular lien. Thus, the special 
lien may exist without the general lien being in force, or the general 
lien may exist without the special lien being in force, or the general 
lien and the special lien may exist simultaneously, depending upon the 
facts and pertinent statutory provisions applicable to the respective 
liens.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6324A-1  Election of and agreement to special lien for estate tax deferred under section 6166 or 6166A.

    (a) Election of lien. If payment of a portion of the estate tax is 
deferred under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal 
by Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981), an executor of a decedent's 
estate who seeks to be discharged from personal liability may

[[Page 208]]

elect a lien in favor of the United States in lieu of the bonds required 
by sections 2204 and 6165. This election is made by applying to the 
Internal Revenue Service office where the estate tax return is filed at 
any time prior to payment of the full amount of estate tax and interest 
due. The application is to be a notice of election requesting the 
special lien provided by section 6324A and is to be accompanied by the 
agreement described in paragraph (b) (1) of this section.
    (b) Agreement to lien--(1) In general. A lien under this section 
will not arise unless all parties having any interest in all property 
designated in the notice of election as property to which the lien is to 
attach sign an agreement in which they consent to the creation of the 
lien. (Property so designated need not be property included in the 
decedent's estate.) The agreement is to be attached to the notice in 
which the lien under section 6324A is elected. It must be in a form that 
is binding on all parties having any interest on the property and must 
contain the following:
    (i) The decedent's name and taxpayer identification number as they 
appear on the estate tax return;
    (ii) The amount of the lien;
    (iii) The fair market value of the property to be subject to the 
lien as of the date of the decedent's death and the date of the election 
under this section;
    (iv) The amount, as of the date of the decedent's death and the date 
of the election, of all encumbrances on the property, including 
mortgages and any lien under section 6324B;
    (v) A clear description of the property which is to be subject to 
the lien, and in the case of property other than land, a statement of 
its estimated remaining useful life; and
    (vi) Designation of an agent (including the agent's address) for the 
beneficiaries of the estate and the consenting parties to the lien for 
all dealings with the Internal Revenue Service on matters arising under 
section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by Economic 
Recovery Tax Act of 1981), or under section 6324A.
    (2) Persons having an interest in designated property. An interest 
in property is any interest which as of the date of the election can be 
asserted under applicable local law so as to affect the disposition of 
any property designated in the agreement required under this section. 
Any person in being at the date of the election who has any such 
interest in the property, whether present or future, or vested or 
contingent, must enter into the agreement. Included among such persons 
are owners of remainder and executory interests, the holders of general 
or special powers of appointment, beneficiaries of a gift over in 
default of exercise of any such power, co-tenants, joint tenants, and 
holders of other undivided interests when the decedent held a joint or 
undivided interest in the property, and trustees of trusts holding any 
interest in the property. An heir who has the power under local law to 
caveat (challenge) a will and thereby affect disposition of the property 
is not, however, considered to be a person with an interest in property 
under section 6324A solely by reason of that right. Likewise, creditors 
of an estate are not such persons solely by reason of their status as 
creditors.
    (3) Consent on behalf of interested party. If any person required to 
enter into the agreement provided for by this paragraph either desires 
that an agent act for him or her or cannot legally bind himself or 
herself due to infancy or other incompetency, a representative 
authorized under local law to bind the interested party in an agreement 
of this nature is permitted to sign the agreement on his or her behalf.
    (4) Duties of agent designated in agreement. The Internal Revenue 
Service will contact the agent designated in the agreement under 
paragraph (b)(1) on all matters relating to continued qualification of 
the estate under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal 
by Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981) and on all matters relating to the 
special lien arising under section 6324A. It is the duty of the agent as 
attorney-in-fact for the parties with interests in the property subject 
to the lien under section 6324A to furnish the Service with any 
requested information and to notify the Service of any event giving rise 
to acceleration of the deferred amount of tax.

[[Page 209]]

    (c) Partial substitution of bond for lien. If the amount of unpaid 
estate tax plus interest exceeds the value (determined for purposes of 
section 6324A(b)(2)) of property listed in the agreement under paragraph 
(b) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service may condition the 
release from personal liability upon the executor's submitting an 
agreement listing additional property or furnishing an acceptable bond 
in the amount of such excess.
    (d) Relation of sections 6324A and 2204. The lien under section 
6324A is deemed to be a bond under section 2204 for purposes of 
determining an executor's release from personal liability. If an 
election has been made under section 6324A, the executor may not 
substitute a bond pursuant to section 2204 in lieu of that lien. If a 
bond has been supplied under section 2204, however, the executor may, by 
filing a proper notice of election and agreement, substitute a lien 
under section 6324A for any part or all of such bond.
    (e) Relation of sections 6324A and 6324. If there is a lien under 
this section on any property with respect to an estate, that lien is in 
lieu of the lien provided by section 6324 on such property with respect 
to the same estate.
    (f) Section 6324A lien to be in lieu of bond under section 6165. The 
lien under section 6324A is in lieu of any bond otherwise required under 
section 6165 with respect to tax to be paid in installments under 
section 6166 or section 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by 
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981).
    (g) Special rule for estates for which elections under section 6324A 
are made on or before August 30, 1980. If a lien is elected under 
section 6324A on or before August 30, 1980, the original election may be 
revoked. To revoke an election, the executor must file a notice of 
revocation containing the decedent's name, date of death, and taxpayer 
identification number with the Internal Revenue Service office where the 
original estate tax return for the decedent was filed. The notice must 
be filed on or before January 31, 1981 (or if earlier, the date on which 
the period of limitation for assessment expires).

<R05>
Sec. 301.6325-1   Release of lien or discharge of property.

    (a) Release of lien--(1) Liability satisfied or unenforceable. Any 
district director may issue a certificate of release of a lien imposed 
with respect to any internal revenue tax, whenever he finds that the 
entire liability for the tax has been satisfied or has become 
unenforceable as a matter of law (and not merely uncollectible or 
unenforceable as a matter of fact). Tax liabilities frequently are 
unenforceable in fact for the time being, due to the temporary 
nonpossession by the taxpayer of discoverable property or property 
rights. In all cases the liability for the payment of the tax continues 
until satisfaction of the tax in full or until the expiration of the 
statutory period for collection, including such extension of the period 
for collection as may be agreed upon in writing by the taxpayer and the 
district director.
    (2) Bond accepted. The district director may, in his discretion, 
issue a certificate of release of any tax lien if he is furnished and 
accepts a bond that is conditioned upon the payment of the amount 
assessed (together with all interest in respect thereof), within the 
time agreed upon in the bond, but not later than 6 months before the 
expiration of the statutory period for collection, including any period 
for collection agreed upon in writing by the district director and the 
taxpayer. For provisions relating to bonds, see sections 7101 and 7102 
and Secs. 301.7101-1 and 301.7102-1.
    (b) Discharge of specific property from the lien--(1) Property 
double the amount of the liability. (i) The district director may, in 
his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the

[[Page 210]]

property subject to a lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Code if he 
determines that the fair market value of that part of the property 
remaining subject to the lien is at least double the sum of the amount 
of the unsatisfied liability secured by the lien and of the amount of 
all other liens upon the property which have priority over the lien. In 
general, fair market value is that amount which one ready and willing 
but not compelled to buy would pay to another ready and willing but not 
compelled to sell the property.
    (ii) The following example illustrates a case in which a certificate 
of discharge may not be given under this subparagraph:

    Example. The Federal tax liability secured by a lien is $1,000. The 
fair market value of all property which after the discharge will 
continue to be subject to the Federal tax lien is $10,000. There is a 
prior mortgage on the property of $5,000, including interest, and the 
property is subject to a prior lien of $100 for real estate taxes. 
Accordingly, the taxpayer's equity in the property over and above the 
amount of the mortgage and real estate taxes is $4,900, or nearly five 
times the amount required to pay the assessed tax on which the Federal 
tax lien is based. Nevertheless, a discharge under this subparagraph is 
not permissible. In the illustration, the sum of the amount of the 
Federal tax liability ($1,000) and of the amount of the prior mortgage 
and the lien for real estate taxes ($5,000+$100=$5,100) is $6,100. 
Double this sum is $12,200, but the fair market value of the remaining 
property is only $10,000. Hence, a discharge of the property is not 
permissible under this subparagraph, since the Code requires that the 
fair market value of the remaining property be at least double the sum 
of two amounts, one amount being the outstanding Federal tax liability 
and the other amount being all prior liens upon such property. In order 
that the discharge may be issued, it would be necessary that the 
remaining property be worth not less than $12,200.

    (2) Part payment; interest of United States valueless--(i) Part 
payment. The district director may, in his discretion, issue a 
certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a lien 
imposed under chapter 64 of the Code if there is paid over to him in 
partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the lien an amount 
determined by him to be not less than the value of the interest of the 
United States in the property to be so discharged. In determining the 
amount to be paid, the district director will take into consideration 
all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the expenses to 
which the Government has been put in the matter. In no case shall the 
amount to be paid be less than the value of the interest of the United 
States in the property with respect to which the certificate of 
discharge is to be issued.
    (ii) Interest of the United States valueless. The district director 
may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of 
the property subject to the lien if he determines that the interest of 
the United States in the property to be so discharged has no value.
    (iii) Valuation of interest of United States. For purposes of this 
subparagraph, in determining the value of the interest of the United 
States in the property, or any part thereof, with respect to which the 
certificate of discharge is to be issued, the district director shall 
give consideration to the value of the property and the amount of all 
liens and encumbrances thereon having priority over the Federal tax 
lien. In determining the value of the property, the district director 
may, in his discretion, give consideration to the forced sale value of 
the property in appropriate cases.
    (3) Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale. A 
district director may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of 
discharge of any part of the property subject to a lien imposed under 
chapter 64 of the Code if such part of the property is sold and, 
pursuant to a written agreement with the district director, the proceeds 
of the sale are held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the 
United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the lien 
or claim had with respect to the discharged property. This subparagraph 
does not apply unless the sale divests the taxpayer of all right, title, 
and interest in the property sought to be discharged. Any reasonable and 
necessary expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the property 
and the administration of the sale proceeds shall be paid by the 
applicant or from the proceeds of the sale before satisfaction of any 
lien or claim of the United States.

[[Page 211]]

    (4) Application for certificate of discharge. Any person desiring a 
certificate of discharge under this paragraph shall submit an 
application in writing to the district director responsible for 
collection of the tax. The application shall contain such information as 
the district director may require.
    (c) Estate or gift tax liability fully satisfied or provided for--
(1) Certificate of discharge. If the district director determines that 
the tax liability for estate or gift tax has been fully satisfied, he 
may issue a certificate of discharge of any or all property from the 
lien imposed thereon. If the district director determines that the tax 
liability for estate or gift tax has been adequately provided for, he 
may issue a certificate discharging particular items of property from 
the lien. If a lien has arisen under section 6324B (relating to special 
lien for additional estate tax attributable to farm, etc., valuation) 
and the district director determines that the liability for additional 
estate tax has been fully secured in accordance with Sec. 20.6324B-1(c) 
of this chapter, the district director may issue a certificate of 
discharge of the real property from the section 6324B lien. The issuance 
of such a certificate is a matter resting within the discretion of the 
district director, and a certificate will be issued only in case there 
is actual need therefor. The primary purpose of such discharge is not to 
evidence payment or satisfaction of the tax, but to permit the transfer 
of property free from the lien in case it is necessary to clear title. 
The tax will be considered fully satisfied only when investigation has 
been completed and payment of the tax, including any deficiency 
determined, has been made.
    (2) Application for certificate of discharge. An application for a 
certificate of discharge of property from the lien for estate or gift 
tax should be filed with the district director responsible for the 
collection of the tax. It should be made in writing under penalties of 
perjury and should explain the circumstances that require the discharge, 
and should fully describe the particular items for which the discharge 
is desired. Where realty is involved each parcel sought to be discharged 
from the lien should be described on a separate page and each such 
description submitted in duplicate. In the case of an estate tax lien, 
the application should show the applicant's relationship to the estate, 
such as executor, heir, devisee, legatee, beneficiary, transferee, or 
purchaser. If the estate or gift tax return has not been filed, a 
statement under penalties of perjury may be required showing (i) the 
value of the property to be discharged, (ii) the basis for such 
valuation, (iii) in the case of the estate tax, the approximate value of 
the gross estate and the approximate value of the total real property 
included in the gross estate, (iv) in the case of the gift tax, the 
total amount of gifts made during the calendar year and the prior 
calendar years subsequent to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1932 
and the approximate value of all real estate subject to the gift tax 
lien, and (v) if the property is to be sold or otherwise transferred, 
the name and address of the purchaser or transferee and the 
consideration, if any, paid or to be paid by him.
    (3) For provisions relating to transfer certificates in the case of 
nonresident estates, see Sec. 20.6325-1 of this chapter (Estate Tax 
Regulations).
    (d) Subordination of lien--(1) By payment of the amount 
subordinated. A district director may, in his discretion, issue a 
certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under chapter 64 of the 
Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien if there is paid 
over to the district director an amount equal to the amount of the lien 
or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United 
States. For this purpose, the tax lien may be subordinated to another 
lien or interest on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, if a notice 
of a Federal tax lien is filed and a delinquent taxpayer secures a 
mortgage loan on a part of the property subject to the tax lien and pays 
over the proceeds of the loan to a district director after an 
application for a certificate of subordination is approved, the district 
director will issue a certificate of subordination. This certificate 
will have the effect of subordinating the tax lien to the mortgage.
    (2) To facilitate tax collection--(i) In general. A district 
director may, in his

[[Page 212]]

discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under 
chapter 64 of the Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien 
if the district director believes that the subordination of the lien 
will ultimately result in an increase in the amount realized by the 
United States from the property subject to the lien and will facilitate 
the ultimate collection of the tax liability.
    (ii) Examples. The provisions of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

     Example 1. A, a farmer needs money in order to harvest his crop. A 
Federal tax lien, notice of which has been filed, is outstanding with 
respect to A's property. B, a lending institution is willing to make the 
necessary loan if the loan is secured by a first mortgage on the farm 
which is prior to the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the district 
director believes that ultimately the amount realizable from A's 
property will be increased and the collection of the tax liability will 
be facilitated by the availability of cash when the crop is harvested 
and sold. In this case, the district director may, in his discretion, 
subordinate the tax lien on the farm to the mortgage securing the crop 
harvesting loan.
    Example 2. C owns a commercial building which is deteriorating and 
in unsalable condition. Because of outstanding Federal tax liens, 
notices of which have been filed, C is unable to finance the repair and 
rehabilitation of the building. D, a contractor, is willing to do the 
work if his mechanic's lien on the property is superior to the Federal 
tax liens. Upon examination, the district director believes that 
ultimately the amount realizable from C's property will be increased and 
the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by arresting 
deterioration of the property and restoring it to salable condition. In 
this case, the district director may, in his discretion, subordinate the 
tax lien on the building to the mechanic's lien.
    Example 3. E, a manufacturer of electronic equipment, obtains 
financing from F, a lending institution, pursuant to a security 
agreement, with respect to which a financing statement was duly filed 
under the Uniform Commercial Code on June 1, 1970. On April 15, 1971, F 
gains actual notice or knowledge that notice of a Federal tax lien had 
been filed against E on March 31, 1971, and F refuses to make further 
advances unless its security interest is assured of priority over the 
Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the district director believes that 
ultimately the amount realizable from E's property will be increased and 
the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated if the work in 
process can be completed and the equipment sold. In this case, the 
district director may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien to 
F's security interest for the further advances required to complete the 
work.
    Example 4. Suit is brought against G by H, who claims ownership of 
property the legal title to which is held by G. A Federal tax lien 
against G, notice of which has previously been filed, will be 
enforceable against the property if G's title is confirmed. Because 
section 6323(b)(8) is inapplicable, J, an attorney, is unwilling to 
defend the case for G unless he is granted a contractual lien on the 
property, superior to the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the 
district director believes that the successful defense of the case by G 
will increase the amount ultimately realizable from G's property and 
will facilitate collection of the tax liability. In this case, the 
district director may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien to 
J's contractual lien on the disputed property to secure J's reasonable 
fees and expenses.

    (3) Subordination of section 6324B lien. The district director may 
issue a certificate of subordination with respect to a lien imposed by 
section 6324B if the district director determines that the interests of 
the United States will be adequately secured after such subordination. 
For example, A, a qualified heir of qualified real property, needs to 
borrow money for farming purposes. If the current fair market value of 
the real property is $150,000, the amount of the claim to which the 
special lien is to be subordinated is $40,000, the potential liability 
for additional tax (as defined in section 2032A(c)) is less than 
$55,000, and there are no other facts to indicate that the interest of 
the United States will not be adequately secured, the district director 
may issue a certificate of subordination. The result would be the same 
if the loan were for bona fide purposes other than farming.
    (4) Application for certificate of subordination. Any person 
desiring a certificate of subordination under this paragraph shall 
submit an application therefor in writing to the district director 
responsible for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain 
such information as the district director may require.
    (e) Nonattachment of lien. If a district director determines that, 
because of confusion of names or otherwise, any person (other than the 
person against whom the tax was assessed) is or may

[[Page 213]]

be injured by the appearance that a notice of lien filed in accordance 
with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1 refers to such person, the district director may 
issue a certificate of nonattachment. Such certificate shall state that 
the lien, notice of which has been filed, does not attach to the 
property of such person. Any person desiring a certificate of 
nonattachment under this paragraph shall submit an application therefor 
in writing to the district director responsible for the collection of 
the tax. The application shall contain such information as the district 
director may require.
    (f) Effect of certificate--(1) Conclusiveness. Except as provided in 
subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, if a certificate is issued 
under section 6325 by a district director and the certificate is filed 
in the same office as the notice of lien to which it relates (if the 
notice of lien has been filed), the certificate shall have the following 
effect--
    (i) In the case of a certificate of release issued under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the tax 
lien referred to in the certificate is extinguished;
    (ii) In the case of a certificate of discharge issued under 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the certificate shall be 
conclusive that the property covered by the certificate is discharged 
from the tax lien;
    (iii) In the case of a certificate of subordination issued under 
paragraph (d) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that 
the lien or interest to which the Federal tax lien is subordinated is 
superior to the tax lien; and
    (iv) In the case of a certificate of nonattachment issued under 
paragraph (e) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that 
the lien of the United States does not attach to the property of the 
person referred to in the certificate.
    (2) Revocation of certificate of release or nonattachment--(i) In 
general. If a district director determines that either--
    (a) A certificate of release or a certificate of nonattachment of 
the general tax lien imposed by section 6321 was issued erroneously or 
improvidently, or
    (b) A certificate of release of such lien was issued in connection 
with a compromise agreement under section 7122 which has been breached,

and if the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the 
tax liability has not expired, the district director may revoke the 
certificate and reinstate the tax lien. The provisions of this 
subparagraph do not apply in the case of the lien imposed by section 
6324 relating to estate and gift taxes.
    (ii) Method of revocation and reinstatement. The revocation and 
reinstatement described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is 
accompanied by--
    (a) Mailing notice of the revocation to the taxpayer at his last 
known address, and
    (b ) Filing notice of the revocation of the certificate in the same 
office in which the notice of lien to which it relates was filed (if the 
notice of lien has been filed).
    (iii) Effect of reinstatement--(a) Effective date. A tax lien 
reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph is 
effective on and after the date the notice of revocation is mailed to 
the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (ii)(a) of 
this subparagraph, but the reinstated lien is not effective before the 
filing of notice of revocation, in accordance with the provisions of 
subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph, if the filing is required by 
reason of the fact that a notice of the lien had been filed.
    (b) Treatment of reinstated lien. As of the effective date of 
reinstatement, a reinstated lien has the same force and effect as a 
general tax lien imposed by section 6321 which arises upon assessment of 
a tax liability. The reinstated lien continues in existence until the 
expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment of 
the tax liability to which it relates. The reinstatement of the lien 
does not retroactively reinstate a previously filed notice of lien. The 
reind lien became effective.
    (iv) Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated 
by the following example:

    Example. On March 1, 1967, an assessment of an unpaid Federal tax 
liability is made against A. On March 1, 1968, notice of the Federal tax 
lien, which arose at the time of

[[Page 214]]

assessment, is filed. On April 1, 1968, A executes a bona fide mortgage 
on property belonging to him to B. On May 1, 1968, a certificate of 
release of the tax lien is erroneously issued and is filed by A in the 
same office in which the notice of lien was filed. On June 3, 1968, the 
lien is reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this 
subparagraph. On July 1, 1968, A executes a bona fide mortgage on 
property belonging to him to C. On August 1, 1968, a notice of the lien 
which was reinstated is properly filed in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. The mortgages of both B and C will have priority 
over the rights of the United States with respect to the tax liability 
in question. Because a reinstated lien continues in existence only until 
the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after 
assessment of the tax liability to which the lien relates, in the 
absence of any extension or suspension of the period of limitation on 
collection after assessment, the reinstated lien will become 
unenforceable by reason of lapse of time after February 28, 1973.

    (3) Certificates void under certain conditions. Notwithstanding any 
other provisions of subtitle F of the Code, any lien for Federal taxes 
attaches to any property with respect to which a certificate of 
discharge has been issued if the person liable for the tax reacquires 
the property after the certificate has been issued. Thus, if property 
subject to a Federal tax lien is discharged therefrom and is later 
reacquired by the delinquent taxpayer at a time when the lien is still 
in existence, the tax lien attaches to the reacquired property and is 
enforceable against it as in the case of after-acquired property 
generally.
    (g) Filing of certificates and notices. If a certificate or notice 
described in this section may not be filed in the office designated by 
State law in which the notice of lien imposed by section 6321 (to which 
the certificate or notice relates) is filed, the certificate or notice 
is effective if filed in the office of the clerk of the United States 
district court for the judicial district in which the State office where 
the notice of lien is filed is situated.

(Secs. 6324B (90 Stat. 1861, 26 U.S.C. 6324B) and 7805 (68A Stat. 917, 
26 U.S.C. 7805))

<R05>
Sec. 301.6326-1  Administrative appeal of the erroneous filing of notice of federal tax lien.

    (a) In general. Any person may appeal to the district director of 
the district in which a notice of federal tax lien was filed on the 
property or rights to property of such person for a release of lien 
alleging an error in the filing of notice of lien. Such appeal may be 
used only for the purpose of correcting the erroneous filing of a notice 
of lien, not to challenge the underlying deficiency that led to the 
imposition of a lien. If the district director determines that the 
Internal Revenue Service has erroneously filed the notice of any federal 
tax lien, the district director shall expeditiously, and, to the extent 
practicable, within 14 days after such determination, issue a 
certificate of release of lien. The certificate of release of such lien 
shall include a statement that the filing of notice of lien was 
erroneous.
    (b) Appeal alleging an error in the filing of notice of lien. For 
purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an appeal of the filing of 
notice of federal tax lien must be based on any one of the following 
allegations:
    (1) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien, plus any interest 
and additions to tax associated with said liability, was satisfied prior 
to the filing of notice of lien;
    (2) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in 
violation of the deficiency procedures set forth in section 6213 of the 
Internal Revenue Code;
    (3) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in 
violation of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code); 
or
    (4) The statutory period for collection of the tax liability that 
gave rise to the lien expired prior to the filing of notice of federal 
tax lien.
    (c) Notice of federal tax lien that lists multiple liabilities. When 
a notice of federal tax lien lists multiple liabilities, a person may 
appeal the filing of notice of lien with respect to one or more of the 
liabilities listed in the notice, if the notice was erroneously filed 
with respect to such liabilities. If a notice of federal tax lien was 
erroneously filed with respect to one or more liabilities

[[Page 215]]

listed in the notice, the district director shall issue a certificate of 
release with respect to such liabilities. For example, if a notice of 
federal tax lien lists tax liabilities for years 1980, 1981 and 1982, 
and the entire liabilities for 1981 and 1982 were paid prior to the 
filing of notice of lien, the taxpayer may appeal the filing of notice 
of lien with respect to the 1981 and 1982 liabilities and the district 
director must issue a certificate of release with respect to the 1981 
and 1982 liabilities.
    (d) Procedures for appeal--(1) Manner. An appeal of the filing of 
notice of federal tax lien shall be made in writing to the district 
director (marked for the attention of the Chief, Special Procedures 
Function) of the district in which the notice of federal tax lien was 
filed.
    (2) Form. The appeal shall include the following information and 
documents:
    (i) Name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
person appealing the filing of notice of federal tax lien;
    (ii) A copy of the notice of federal tax lien affecting the 
property, if available; and
    (iii) The grounds upon which the filing of notice of federal tax 
lien is being appealed.
    (A) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed 
is that the tax liability in question was satisfied prior to the filing, 
proof of full payment as defined in paragraph (e) of this section must 
be provided.
    (B) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed 
is that the tax liability that gave rise to lien was assessed in 
violation of the deficiency procedures set forth in section 6213 of the 
Internal Revenue Code, the appealing party must explain how the 
assessment was erroneous.
    (C) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed 
is that the tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in 
violation of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code), 
the appealing party must provide the following:
    (1) The identity of the court and the district in which the 
bankruptcy petition was filed; and
    (2) The docket number and the date of filing of the bankruptcy 
petition.
    (3) Time. An administrative appeal of the erroneous filing of notice 
of federal tax lien shall be made within 1 year after the taxpayer 
becomes aware of the erroneously filed tax lien.
    (e) Proof of full payment. As used in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this 
section, the term ``proof of full payment'' means:
    (1) An internal revenue cashier's receipt reflecting full payment of 
the tax liability in question prior to the date the federal tax lien 
issue was filed;
    (2) A canceled check to the Internal Revenue Service in an amount 
which was sufficient to satisfy the tax liability for which release is 
being sought; or
    (3) Any other manner of proof acceptable to the district director.
    (f) Exclusive remedy. The appeal established by section 6326 of the 
Internal Revenue Code and by this section shall be the exclusive 
administrative remedy with respect to the erroneous filing of a notice 
of federal tax lien.
    (g) Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective 
July 7, 1989.

               Seizure of Property for Collection of Taxes


<R05>
Sec. 301.6331-1  Levy and distraint.

    (a) Authority to levy--(1) In general. If any person liable to pay 
any tax neglects or refuses to pay the tax within 10 days after notice 
and demand, the district director to whom the assessment is charged (or, 
upon his request, any other district director) may proceed to collect 
the tax by levy. The district director may levy upon any property, or 
rights to property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, 
belonging to the taxpayer. The district director may also levy upon 
property with respect to which there is a lien provided by section 6321 
or 6324 for the payment of the tax. For exemption of certain property 
from levy, see section 6334 and the regulations thereunder. As used in 
section 6331 and this section, the term ``tax'' includes any interest, 
additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with 
costs and expenses. Property subject to a Federal tax lien which has 
been sold or otherwise transferred by the taxpayer may be seized while 
in the hands of the

[[Page 216]]

transferee or any subsequent transferee. However, see provisions under 
sections 6323 and 6324 (a)(2) and (b) for protection of certain 
transferees against a Federal tax lien. Levy may be made by serving a 
notice of levy on any person in possession of, or obligated with respect 
to, property or rights to property subject to levy, including 
receivables, bank accounts, evidences of debt, securities, and salaries, 
wages, commissions, or other compensation. A levy on a bank reaches any 
interest that accrues on the taxpayer's balance under the terms of the 
bank's agreement with the depositor during the 21-day holding period 
provided for in section 6332(c). Except as provided in Sec. 301.6331-
1(b)(1) with regard to a levy on salary or wages, a levy extends only to 
property possessed and obligations which exist at the time of the levy. 
Obligations exist when the liability of the obligor is fixed and 
determinable although the right to receive payment thereof may be 
deferred until a later date. For example, if on the first day of the 
month a delinquent taxpayer sold personal property subject to an 
agreement that the buyer remit the purchase price on the last day of the 
month, a levy made on the buyer on the 10th day of the month would reach 
the amount due on the sale, although the buyer need not satisfy the levy 
by paying over the amount to the district director until the last day of 
the month. Similarly, a levy only reaches property in the possession of 
the person levied upon at the time the levy is made together with 
interest that accrues during the 21-day holding period provided for in 
section 6332(c). For example, a levy made on a bank with respect to the 
account of a delinquent taxpayer is satisfied if the bank surrenders the 
amount of the taxpayer's balance at the time the levy is made. The levy 
has no effect upon any subsequent deposit made in the bank by the 
taxpayer. Subsequent deposits may be reached only by a subsequent levy 
on the bank.
    (2) Jeopardy cases. If the district director finds that the 
collection of any tax is in jeopardy, he or she may make notice and 
demand for immediate payment of such tax and, upon failure or refusal to 
pay such tax, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful without regard 
to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a), the 30-day period 
provided in section 6331(d), or the limitation on levy provided in 
section 6331(g)(1).
    (3) Bankruptcy or receivership cases. During a bankruptcy proceeding 
or a receivership proceeding in either a Federal or a State court, the 
assets of the taxpayer are in general under the control of the court in 
which such proceeding is pending. Taxes cannot be collected by levy upon 
assets in the custody of a court, whether or not such custody is 
incident to a bankruptcy or receivership proceeding, except where the 
proceeding has progressed to such a point that the levy would not 
interfere with the work of the court or where the court grants 
permission to levy. Any assets which under applicable provisions of law 
are not under the control of the court may be levied upon, for example, 
property exempt from court custody under State law or the bankrupt's 
earnings and property acquired after the date of bankruptcy. However, 
levy upon such property is not mandatory and the Government may rely 
upon payment of taxes in the proceeding.
    (4) Certain types of compensation-- (i) Federal employees. Levy may 
be made upon the salary or wages of any officer or employee (including 
members of the Armed Forces), or elected or appointed official, of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or 
instrumentality of either, by serving a notice of levy on the employer 
of the delinquent taxpayer. As used in this subdivision, the term 
``employer'' means (a) the officer or employee of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, or of the agency or instrumentality of the United 
States or the District of Columbia, who has control of the payment of 
the wages, or (b) any other officer or employee designated by the head 
of the branch, department, agency, or instrumentality of the United 
States or of the District of Columbia as the party upon whom service of 
the notice of levy may be made. If the head of such branch, department, 
agency or instrumentality designates an officer or employee other than 
one who has control of the payment of the wages, as

[[Page 217]]

the party upon whom service of the notice of levy may be made, such head 
shall promptly notify the Commissioner of the name and address of each 
officer or employee so designated and the scope or extent of his 
authority as such designee.
    (ii) State and municipal employees. Salaries, wages, or other 
compensation of any officer, employee, or elected or appointed official 
of a State or Territory, or of any agency, instrumentality, or political 
subdivision thereof, are also subject to levy to enforce collection of 
any Federal tax.
    (iii) Seamen. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 of the 
Seamen's Act of 1915 (46 U.S.C. 601), wages of seamen, apprentice 
seamen, or fishermen employed on fishing vessels are subject to levy. 
See section 6334(c).
    (5) Noncompetent Indians. Solely for purposes of sections 6321 and 
6331, any interest in restricted land held in trust by the United States 
for an individual noncompetent Indian (and not for a tribe) shall not be 
deemed to be property, or a right to property, belonging to such Indian.
    (b) Continuing levies and successive seizures--(1) Continuing effect 
of levy on salary and wages. A levy on salary or wages has continuous 
effect from the time the levy originally is made until the levy is 
released pursuant to section 6343. For this purpose, the term salary or 
wages includes compensation for services paid in the form of fees, 
commissions, bonuses, and similar items. The levy attaches to both 
salary or wages earned but not yet paid at the time of the levy, 
advances on salary or wages made subsequent to the date of the levy, and 
salary or wages earned and becoming payable subsequent to the date of 
the levy, until the levy is released pursuant to section 6343. In 
general, salaries or wages that are the subject of a continuing levy and 
are not exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(8) or (9), are to be paid 
to the district director, the service center director, or the compliance 
center director (director) on the same date the payor would otherwise 
pay over the money to the taxpayer. For example, if an individual 
normally is paid on the Wednesday following the close of each work week, 
a levy made upon his or her employer on any Monday would apply to both 
wages due for the prior work week and wages for succeeding work weeks as 
such wages become payable. In such a case, the levy would be satisfied 
if, on the first Wednesday after the levy and on each Wednesday 
thereafter until the employer receives a notice of release from levy 
described in section 6343, the employer pays over to the director wages 
that would otherwise be paid to the employee on such Wednesday (less any 
exempt amount pursuant to section 6334).
    (2) Successive seizures. Whenever any property or rights to property 
upon which a levy has been made are not sufficient to satisfy the claim 
of the United States for which the levy is made, the district director 
may thereafter, and as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy in 
like manner upon any other property or rights to property subject to 
levy of the person against whom such claim exists or on which there is a 
lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324 (or the corresponding provision of 
prior law) for the payment of such claim until the amount due from such 
person, together with all costs and expenses, is fully paid.
    (c) Service of notice of levy by mail. A notice of levy may be 
served by mailing the notice to the person upon whom the service of a 
notice of levy is authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In 
such a case the date and time the notice is delivered to the person to 
be served is the date and time the levy is made. If the notice is sent 
by certificated mail, return receipt requested, the date of delivery on 
the receipt is treated as the date the levy is made. If, after receipt 
of a notice of levy, an officer or other person authorized to act on 
behalf of the person served signs and notes the date and time of receipt 
on the notice of levy, the date and time so noted will be presumed to 
be, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the date and time of 
delivery.
    Any person may, upon written notice to the district director having 
audit jurisdiction over such person, have all notices of levy by mail 
sent to one designated office. After such a notice is received by the 
district director, notices

[[Page 218]]

of levy by mail will be sent to the designated office until a written 
notice withdrawing the request or a written notice designating a 
different office is received by the district director.
    (d) Effective date. These regulations are effective December 10, 
1992.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6331-2  Procedures and restrictions on levies.

    (a) Notice of intent to levy--(1) In general. Levy may be made upon 
the salary, wages, or other property of a taxpayer for any unpaid tax no 
less than 30 days after the district director, the service center 
director, or the compliance center director (director) has notified the 
taxpayer in writing of the intent to levy. The notice must be given in 
person, be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of the 
taxpayer, or be sent by registered or certified mail to the taxpayer's 
last known address. The notice of intent to levy is separate from, but 
may be given at the same time as, the notice and demand described in 
Sec. 301.6331-1.
    (2) Content of Notice. The notice of intent to levy is to contain a 
brief statement in nontechnical terms including the following 
information--
    (i) The Internal Revenue Code provisions and the procedures relating 
to levy and sale of property;
    (ii) The administrative appeals available with respect to the levy 
and sale of property and the procedures relating to such appeals;
    (iii) The alternatives available that could prevent levy on the 
property (including the use of an installment agreement under section 
6159); and
    (iv) The Internal Revenue Code provisions and the procedures 
relating to redemption of property and release of liens on property.
    (b) Uneconomical levy--(1) In general. No levy may be made on 
property if the director estimates that the anticipated expenses with 
respect to the levy and sale will exceed the fair market value of the 
property. The estimate is to be made on an aggregate basis for all of 
the items that are anticipated to be seized pursuant to the levy. 
Generally, no levy should be made on individual items of insignificant 
monetary value. For the definition of fair market value, see 
Sec. 301.6325-1(b)(1)(i). See Sec. 301.6341-1 concerning the expenses of 
levy and sale.
    (2) Time of estimate. The estimate, which may be formal or informal, 
is to be made at the time of the seizure or within a reasonable period 
of time prior to a seizure. The estimate may be based on earlier 
estimates of fair market value and anticipated expenses of the same or 
similar property.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example 1. A director anticipates that the taxpayer has only one 
item of property that can be seized and sold. This item is estimated to 
have a fair market value of $250.00. The director also estimates that 
the costs of seizure and sale will total $300.00 if this item is seized. 
The director is prohibited from levying on this one item of the 
taxpayer's property because the costs of seizure and sale are estimated 
to exceed the property's fair market value.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that the 
director anticipates that the taxpayer has 10 items of property that can 
be seized and sold. Each of those items is estimated to have a fair 
market value of $250.00. The director also estimates that the costs of 
seizure and sale will total $300.00 regardless of how many of those 
items are seized. The director is prohibited from levying on only one 
item of the taxpayer's property because the costs of seizure and sale 
are estimated to exceed the fair market value of the single item of 
property. The director, however, would not be prohibited from levying on 
two or more items of the taxpayer's property because the aggregate fair 
market value of the seized property would exceed the estimated costs of 
seizure and sale.
    Example 3. The taxpayer has three items of property, A, B, and C. 
The director anticipates that the value of items A, B, and C depends on 
their being sold as a unit. The director estimates that due to high 
anticipated costs of storing or maintaining item B prior to the sale, 
the aggregate fair market value of items A, B, and C will not exceed the 
anticipated expenses of seizure and sale if all three items are seized. 
Accordingly, the director is prohibited from levying on items A, B, and 
C.
    Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that the 
director does not anticipate that the value of items A, B, and C depends 
on those items being sold as a unit.

[[Page 219]]

If the director estimates that the aggregate fair market value of items 
A and C exceeds the aggregate anticipated costs of the seizure and sale 
of those two items, items A and C can be seized and sold. The director 
is prohibited from levying on item B because the high cost of storing or 
maintaining item B is estimated to exceed the fair market value of item 
B.

    (c) Restriction on levy on date of appearance. Except for continuing 
levies on salaries or wages described in Sec. 301.6331-1(b)(1), no levy 
may be made on any property of a person on the day that person, or an 
officer or employee of that person, is required to appear in response to 
a summons served for the purpose of collecting any underpayment of tax 
from that person. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the date on which 
an appearance is required is the date fixed by an officer or employee of 
the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 7605 or the date (if 
any) fixed as the result of a judicial proceeding instituted under 
sections 7604 and 7402(b) seeking the enforcement of the summons.
    (d) Jeopardy. Paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section do not apply to 
a levy if the director finds, for purposes of Sec. 301.6331-1(a)(2), 
that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.
    (e) Effective date. These regulations are effective December 10, 
1992.

Sec. 301.6332-1   Surrender of property subject to levy.

    (a) Requirement--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 301.6332-2, relating to levy in the case of life insurance and 
endowment contracts, and in Sec. 301.6332-3, relating to property held 
by banks, any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) 
property or rights to property subject to levy and upon which a levy has 
been made shall, upon demand of the district director, surrender the 
property or rights (or discharge the obligation) to the district 
director, except that part of the property or rights (or obligation) 
which, at the time of the demand, is actually or constructively under 
the jurisdiction of a court because of an attachment or execution under 
any judicial process.
    (2) Levy on bank deposits held in offices outside the United States. 
Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), if a levy has 
been made upon property or rights to property subject to levy which a 
bank engaged in the banking business in the United States or a 
possession of the United States is in possession of (or obligated with 
respect to), the Commissioner shall not enforce the levy with respect to 
any deposits held in an office of the bank outside the United States or 
a possession of the United States, unless the notice of levy specifies 
that the district director intends to reach such deposits. The notice of 
levy shall not specify that the district director intends to reach such 
deposits unless the district director believes--
    (i) That the taxpayer is within the jurisdiction of a U.S. court at 
the time the levy is made and that the bank is in possession of (or 
obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office of the 
bank outside the United States or a possession of the United States; or
    (ii) That the taxpayer is not within the jurisdiction of a U.S. 
court at the time the levy is made, that the bank is in possession of 
(or obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office 
outside the United States or a possession of the United States, and that 
such deposits consist, in whole or in part, of funds transferred from 
the United States or a possession of the United States in order to 
hinder or delay the collection of a tax imposed by the Code. For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``possession of the United 
States'' includes Guam, the Midway Islands, the Panama Canal Zone, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and 
Wake Island.
    (b) Enforcement of levy--(1) Extent of personal liability. Any 
person who, upon demand of the district director, fails or refuses to 
surrender any property or right to property subject to levy is liable in 
his own person and estate in a sum equal to the value of the property or 
rights not so surrendered, together with costs and interest. The 
liability, however, may not exceed the amount of the taxes for the 
collection of which the levy was made. Interest is to be

[[Page 220]]

computed at the annual rate referred to in regulations under section 
6621 from the date of the levy, or, in the case of a continuing levy on 
salary or wages (see section 6331(d)(3)), from the date the person would 
otherwise have been obligated to pay over the wages or salary to the 
taxpayer. Any amount recovered, other than cost, will be credited 
against the tax liability for the collection of which the levy was made.
    (2) Penalty for violation. In addition to the personal liability 
described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), any person who is 
required to surrender property or rights to property and who fails or 
refuses to surrender them without reasonable cause is liable for a 
penalty equal to 50 percent of the amount recoverable under section 
6332(d)(1). No part of the penalty described in this subparagraph shall 
be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which the 
levy was made. The penalty described in this subparagraph is not 
applicable in cases where bona fide dispute exists concerning the amount 
of the property to be surrendered pursuant to a levy or concerning the 
legal effectiveness of the levy. However, if a court in a later 
enforcement suit sustains the levy, then reasonable cause would usually 
not exist to refuse to honor a later levy made under similar 
circumstances.
    (c) Effect of honoring levy--(1) In general. Any person in 
possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or rights to 
property subject to levy and upon which a levy has been made who, upon 
demand by the district director, surrenders the property or rights to 
property, or discharges the obligation, to the district director, or who 
pays a liability described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is 
discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer 
and any other person with respect to the property or rights to property 
arising from the surrender or payment.
    (2) Exception for certain incorrectly surrendered property. Any 
person who surrenders to the Internal Revenue Service property or rights 
to property not properly subject to levy in which the delinquent 
taxpayer has no apparent interest is not relieved of liability to a 
third party who has an interest in the property. However, if the 
delinquent taxpayer has an apparent interest in property or rights to 
property, a person who makes a good faith determination that such 
property or rights to property in his or her possession has been levied 
upon by the Internal Revenue Service and who surrenders the property to 
the United States in response to the levy is relived of liability to a 
third party who has an interest in the property or rights to property, 
even if it is subsequently determined that the property was not properly 
subject to levy.
    (3) Remedy. In situations described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) 
of this section, taxpayers and third parties who have an interest in 
property surrendered in response to a levy may secure from the Internal 
Revenue Service the administrative relief provided for in section 
6343(b) or may bring suit to recover the property under section 7426.
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. M Bank is served with a notice of levy for an unpaid tax 
liability due from A in the amount of $2,000. M Bank holds $2,000 in a 
checking account in the names of A or B or C. Although all of the 
deposits into the account were made by B and C, A has an unrestricted 
right to withdraw the funds from the account. M Bank surrenders the 
entire account to the district director at the end of the holding period 
provided in section 6332(c). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, M 
Bank is not liable to B or C for any amount, even if B or C prove that 
the funds in the account did not belong to A, because A's unrestricted 
right to withdraw the funds is an interest which in subject to levy. B 
or C may, however, seek the return of the funds from the United States 
as provided in sections 6343(b) and 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Example 2. A is indebted to B for $400. Unbeknownst to A, B has 
assigned his right to receive payment to C. A is served with a notice of 
levy for an unpaid tax liability due from B for $400. A, acting with no 
knowledge of the assignment to C, surrenders $400 to the district 
director. A is discharged from his obligation to pay B, the taxpayer. 
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, because B had an apparent 
interest in the funds that A owed to B, and because A determined in good 
faith that those funds had been levied upon, A is also discharged from 
any liability to C, even though the money is not properly subject to 
levy. C may, however, seek return of the payment from the United States 
as provided

[[Page 221]]

in sections 6343(b) and 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Example 3. M Bank is served with a notice of levy for an unpaid tax 
liability due from ``John H. Smith, Sr.'' in the amount of $5,000. M 
Bank fails to read the notice of levy carefully. When searching its 
records, M Bank finds the name of ``John H. Smith, Jr.'' and looks no 
further. M Bank surrenders $5,000 from John H. Smith, Jr.'s checking 
account to the district director. M Bank is not discharged from 
liability under section 6332(e) of the Internal Revenue Code because the 
delinquent taxpayer (John H. Smith, Sr.) had no apparent interest in the 
account of John H. Smith, Jr. (Generally, John H. Smith Jr. may seek 
return of the payment from the United States as provided in sections 
6343 and 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code.)
    Example 4. M Bank is served with a notice of levy for an unpaid tax 
liability due from ``Robert A. Jones'' in the amount of $5,000. M Bank 
searches its records and identifies four separate accounts of $1,000 
each in the name of ``Robert A. Jones.'' All four accounts list 
different addresses and social security identification numbers. M Bank 
surrenders all four accounts totalling $4,000 in response to the levy. M 
Bank could not in good faith have determined that all four accounts were 
levied upon. Therefore, M Bank is not discharged from liability to any 
person other than the taxpayer whose account was levied upon.

    (5) Effective date. Paragraph (c) of this section is effective 
January 11, 1993. However, persons surrendering property to the Internal 
Revenue Service may rely on the regulations with respect to levies 
issued after November 10, 1988.
    (d) Person defined. The term ``person,'' as used in section 6332(a) 
and this section, includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a 
member or employee of a partnership, who is under a duty to surrender 
the property or rights to property or to discharge the obligation. In 
the case of a levy upon the salary or wages of an officer, employee, or 
elected or appointed official of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of either, the term 
``person'' includes the officer or employee of the United States, of the 
District of Columbia, or of such agency or instrumentality who is under 
a duty to discharge the obligation. As to the officer or employee who is 
under such duty, see paragraph (a)(4)(i) of Sec. 301.6331-1.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6332-2   Surrender of property subject to levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts.

    (a) In general. This section provides special rules relating to the 
surrender of property subject to levy in the case of life insurance and 
endowment contracts. The provisions of Sec. 301.6332-1 which relate 
generally to the surrender of property subject to levy apply, to the 
extent not inconsistent with the special rules set forth in this 
section, to a levy in the case of life insurance and endowment 
contracts.
    (b) Effect of service of notice of levy--(1) In general. A notice of 
levy served by a district director on an insuring organization with 
respect to a life insurance or endowment contract issued by the 
organization shall constitute--
    (i) A demand by the district director for the payment of the cash 
loan value of the contract adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c) of 
this section, and
    (ii) The exercise of the right of the person against whom the tax is 
assessed to the advance of such cash loan value. It is unnecessary for 
the district director to surrender the contract document to the insuring 
organization upon which the levy is made. However, the notice of levy 
will include a certification by the district director that a copy of the 
notice of levy has been mailed to the person against whom the tax is 
assessed at his last known address. At the time of service of the notice 
of levy, the levy is effective with respect to the cash loan value of 
the insurance contract, subject to the condition that if the levy is not 
satisfied or released before the 90th day after the date of service, the 
levy can be satisfied only by payment of the amount described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. Other than satisfaction or release of the 
levy, no event during the 90-day period subsequent to the date of 
service of the notice of levy shall release the cash loan value from the 
effect of the levy. For example, the termination of the policy by the 
taxpayer or by the

[[Page 222]]

death of the insured during such 90-day period shall not release the 
levy. For the rules relating to the time when the insuring organization 
is to pay over the required amount, see paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Notification of amount subject to levy--(i) Full payment before 
the 90th day. In the event that the unpaid liability to which the levy 
relates is satisfied at any time during the 90-day period subsequent to 
the date of service of the notice of levy, the district director will 
promptly give the insuring organization written notification that the 
levy is released.
    (ii) Notification after the 90th day. In the event that notification 
is not given under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the district 
director will, promptly following the 90th day after service of the 
notice of levy, give the insuring organization written notification of 
the current status of all accounts listed on the notice of levy, and of 
the total payments received since service of the notice of levy. This 
notification will be given to the insuring organization whether or not 
there has been any change in the status of the accounts.
    (c) Satisfaction of levy--(1) In general. The levy described in 
paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a life insurance or 
endowment contract shall be deemed to be satisfied if the insuring 
organization pays over to the district director the amount which the 
person against whom the tax is assessed could have had advanced to him 
by the organization on the 90th day after service of the notice of levy 
on the organization. However, this amount is increased by the amount of 
any advance (including contractual interest thereon), generally called a 
policy loan, made to the person on or after the date the organization 
has actual notice or knowledge, within the meaning of section 
6323(i)(1), of the existence of the tax lien with respect to which the 
levy is made. The insuring organization may, nevertheless, make an 
advance (including contractual interest thereon), generally called an 
automatic premium loan, made automatically to maintain the contract in 
force under an agreement entered into before the organization has such 
actual notice or knowledge. In any event, the amount paid to the 
district director by the insuring organization is not to exceed the 
amount of the unpaid liability shown on the notification described in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The amount, determined in accordance 
with the provisions of this section, subject to the levy shall be paid 
to the district director by the insuring organization promptly after 
receipt of the notification described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. The satisfaction of a levy with respect to a life insurance or 
endowment contract will not discharge the contract from the tax lien. 
However, see section 6323(b)(9)(C) and the regulations thereunder 
concerning the liability of an insurance company after satisfaction of a 
levy with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract. If the 
person against whom the tax is assessed so directs, the insuring 
organization, on a date before the 90th day after service of the notice 
of levy, may satisfy the levy by paying over an amount computed in 
accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph substituting such 
date for the 90th day. In the event of termination of the policy by the 
taxpayer or by the death of the insured on a date before the 90th day 
after service of the notice of levy, the amount to be paid over to the 
district director by the insuring organization in satisfaction of the 
levy shall be an amount computed in accordance with the provisions of 
this subparagraph substituting the date of termination of the policy or 
the date of death for the 90th day.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On March 5, 1968, a notice of levy for an unpaid income 
tax assessment due from A in the amount of $3,000 is served on the X 
Insurance Company with respect to A's life insurance policy. On March 5, 
1968, the cash loan value of the policy is $1,500. On April 9, 1968, A 
does not pay a premium due on the policy in the amount of $200. Under an 
automatic premium advance provision contained in the policy originally 
issued in 1960, X advances the premium out of the cash value of the 
policy. As of June 3, 1968 (the 90th day after service of the notice of 
levy), pursuant to the provisions of the policy, the amount of accrued 
charges upon the automatic premium advance in the amount of $200 for the 
period April 9, 1968, through June

[[Page 223]]

3, 1968, is $2. On June 5, 1968, the district director gives written 
notification to X indicating that A's unpaid tax assessment is $2,500. 
Under this section, X is required to pay to the district director, 
promptly after receipt of the June 5, 1968, notification, the sum of 
$1,298 ($1,500 less $200 less $2), which is the amount A could have had 
advanced to him by X on June 3, 1968.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on May 
10, 1968, A requests and X grants an advance in the amount of $1,000. X 
has actual notice of the existence of the lien by reason of the service 
of the notice of levy on March 5, 1968. This advance is not required to 
be made automatically under the policy and reduces the amount of the 
cash value of the policy. For the use of the $1,000 advance during the 
period May 10, 1968, through June 3, 1968, X charges A the sum of $3. 
Under this section, X is required to pay to the district director, 
promptly after receipt of the June 5, 1968, notification, the sum of 
$1,298. This $1,298 amount is composed of the $295 amount ($1,500 less 
$200 less $2 less $1,000 less $3) A could have had advanced to him by X 
on June 3, 1968, plus the $1,000 advance plus the charges in the amount 
of $3 with respect thereto.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the 
insurance contract does not contain an automatic premium advance 
provision. The contract does provide that, upon default in the payment 
of premiums, the policy shall automatically be converted to paid-up term 
insurance with no cash or loan value. A fails to make the premium 
payment of $200 due on April 9, 1968. After expiration of a grace period 
to make the premium payment, the X Insurance Company applies the cash 
loan value of $1,500 to effect the conversion. Since the service of the 
notice of levy constitutes the exercise of A's right to receive the cash 
loan value and the amount applied to effect the conversion is not an 
automatic advance to A to maintain the policy in force, the conversion 
of the policy is not an event which will release the cash loan value 
from the effect of the levy. Therefore, X Insurance Company is required 
to pay to the district director, promptly after receipt of the June 5, 
1968 notification, the sum of $1,500.

    (d) Other enforcement proceedings. The satisfaction of the levy 
described in paragraph (b) of this section by an insuring organization 
shall be without prejudice to any civil action for the enforcement of 
any Federal tax lien with respect to a life insurance or endowment 
contract. Thus, this levy procedure is not the exclusive means of 
subjecting the life insurance and endowment contracts of the person 
against whom a tax is assessed to the collection of his unpaid 
assessment. The United States may choose to foreclose the tax lien in 
any case where it is appropriate, as, for example, to reach the cash 
surrender value (as distinguished from cash loan value) of a life 
insurance or endowment contract.
    (e) Cross references. (1) For provisions relating to priority of 
certain advances with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract 
after satisfaction of a levy pursuant to section 6332(b), see section 
6323(b)(9) and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) For provisions relating to the issuance of a certificate of 
discharge of a life insurance or endowment contract subject to a tax 
lien, see section 6325(b) and the regulations thereunder.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6332-3  The 21-day holding period applicable to property held by banks.

    (a) In general. This section provides special rules relating to the 
surrender, after 21 days, of deposits subject to levy which are held by 
banks. The provisions of Sec. 301.6332-1 which relate generally to the 
surrender of property subject to levy apply, to the extent not 
inconsistent with the special rules set forth in this section, to a levy 
on property held by banks.
    (b) Definition of bank. For purposes of this section, the term 
``bank'' means--
    (1) A bank or trust company or domestic building and loan 
association incorporated and doing business under the laws of the United 
States (including laws relating to the District of Columbia) or of any 
State, a substantial part of the business of which consists of receiving 
deposits and making loans and discounts, or of exercising fiduciary 
powers similar to those permitted to national banks under authority of 
the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is subject by law to 
supervision and examination by State or Federal authority having 
supervision over banking institutions;
    (2) Any credit union the member accounts of which are insured in 
accordance with the provisions of title II of the Federal Credit Union 
Act, 12 U.S.C. 1781 et seq.; and

[[Page 224]]

    (3) A corporation which, under the laws of the State of its 
incorporation, is subject to supervision and examination by the 
Commissioner of Banking or other officer of such State in charge of the 
administration of the banking laws of such State.
    (c) 21-day holding period--(1) In general. When a levy is made on 
deposits held by a bank, the bank shall surrender such deposits (not 
otherwise subject to an attachment or execution under judicial process) 
only after 21 calendar days after the date the levy is made. The 
district director may request an extension of the 21-day holding period 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. During the prescribed 
holding period, or any extension thereof, the levy shall be released 
only upon notification to the bank by the district director of a 
decision by the Internal Revenue Service to release the levy. If the 
bank does not receive such notification from the district director 
within the prescribed holding period, or any extension thereof, the bank 
must surrender the deposits, including any interest thereon as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section (up to 
the amount of the levy), on the first business day after the holding 
period, or any extension thereof, expires. See Sec. 301.6331-1(c) to 
determine when a levy served by mail is made.
    (2) Payment of interest on deposits. When a bank surrenders levied 
deposits at the end of the 21-day holding period (or at the end of any 
longer period that has been requested by the district director), the 
bank must include any interest that has accrued on the deposits prior to 
and during the holding period, and any extension thereof, under the 
terms of the bank's agreement with its depositor, but the bank must not 
surrender an amount greater than the amount of the levy. If the deposits 
are held in a noninterest bearing account at the time the levy is made, 
the bank need not include any interest on the deposits at the end of the 
holding period, or any extension thereof, under this paragraph. Interest 
that accrues on deposits and is surrendered to the district director at 
the end of the holding period, or any extension thereof, is treated as a 
payment to the bank's customer.
    (3) Transactions affecting accounts. A levy on deposits held by a 
bank applies to those funds on deposit at the time the levy is made, up 
to the amount of the levy, and is effective as of the time the levy is 
made. No withdrawals may be made on levied upon deposits during the 21-
day holding period, or any extension thereof.
    (4) Waiver of 21-day holding period. A depositor may waive the 21-
day holding period by notifying the bank of the depositor's intention to 
do so. Where more than one depositor is listed as the owner of a levied 
account, all depositors listed as owners of the account must agree to a 
waiver of the 21-day holding period. If the 21-day holding period is 
waived, the bank must include with the surrendered deposits a 
notification to the district director of the waiver.
    (5) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On April 2, 1992, a notice of levy for an unpaid income 
tax assessment due from A in the amount of $10,000 is served on X Bank 
with respect to A's savings account. At the time the notice of levy is 
served, X Bank holds $5,000 in A's interest-bearing savings account. On 
April 24, 1992, (the first business day after the 21-day holding period) 
X Bank must surrender $5,000 plus any interest that accrued on the 
account under the terms of A's contract with X Bank up through April 23, 
1992, (the last day of the holding period).
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that on 
April 3, 1992, A deposits an additional $5,000 into the account. On 
April 24, 1992, X Bank must still surrender only $5,000 plus the 
interest which accrued thereon until the end of the holding period, 
because the notice of levy served on April 2, 1992, attached only to 
those funds on deposit at the time the notice was served and not to any 
subsequent deposits.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that at the 
time the notice of levy is served on X Bank, A's savings account 
contains $50,000. On April 24, 1992, X Bank must surrender $10,000, 
which is the amount of the levy. The levy will not apply to any interest 
that accrues on the deposit during the 21-day holding period, because 
the entire amount of the levy is satisfied by the deposits existing at 
the time the levy is served.
    Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that the 
amount of the levy is $5,002. Under the terms of A's contract with the 
bank, the account will earn more than $2

[[Page 225]]

of interest during the 21-day holding period. On April 24, 1992, X Bank 
must surrender $5,002 to the district director. The remaining interest 
which accrued during the 21-day holding period is not subject to the 
levy.
    Example 5. On September 3, 1992, A opens a $5,000 six-month 
certificate of deposit account with X Bank. Under the terms of the 
account, the depositor must forfeit up to 30 days of interest on the 
account in the event of early withdrawal. On January 4, 1993, a notice 
of levy for an unpaid income tax assessment due from A in the amount of 
$10,000 is served with respect to A's certificate of deposit account. On 
January 26, 1993, the bank must surrender $5,000 plus the interest which 
accrued on the account through January 25, 1993, minus the penalty of 30 
days of interest as provided in the deposit agreement.
    Example 6. Same facts as in Example 5 except that the notice of levy 
is served on X Bank on February 15, 1993. The certificate matures on 
March 2, 1993. On March 8, X Bank must surrender $5,000 plus the 
interest that accrued on the certificate without any reduction for 
penalties.

    (d) Notification to the district director of errors with respect to 
levied upon bank accounts--(1) In general. If a depositor believes that 
there is an error with respect to the levied upon account which the 
depositor wishes to have corrected, the depositor shall notify the 
district director to whom the assessment is charged by telephone to the 
telephone number listed on the face of the notice of levy in order to 
enable the district director to conduct an expeditious review of the 
alleged error. The district director may require any supporting 
documentation necessary to the review of the alleged error. The 
notification by telephone provided for in this section does not 
constitute or substitute for the filing by a third party of a written 
request under Sec. 301.6343-1(b)(2) for the return of property 
wrongfully levied upon.
    (2) Disputes regarding the merits of the underlying assessment. This 
section does not constitute an additional procedure for an appeal 
regarding the merits of an underlying assessment. However, if in the 
judgment of the district director a genuine dispute regarding the merits 
of an underlying assessment appears to exist, the district director may 
request an extension of the 21-day holding period.
    (3) Notification of errors from sources other than the depositor. 
The district director may take action to release the levy on the bank 
account based on information obtained from a source other than the 
depositor, including the bank in which the account is maintained.

Sec. 301.6333-1   Production of books.

    If a levy has been made or is about to be made on any property or 
rights to property, any person, having custody or control of any books 
or records containing evidence or statements relating to the property or 
rights to property subject to levy, shall, upon demand of the internal 
revenue officer who has made or is about to make the levy, exhibit such 
books or records to such officer.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6334-1   Property exempt from levy.

    (a) Enumeration. In addition to exemptions allowed as a matter of 
Internal Revenue Service policy, there shall be exempt from levy--
    (1) Wearing apparel and school books. Such items of wearing apparel 
and such school books as are necessary for the taxpayer or for members 
of his family. Expensive items of wearing apparel, such as furs, which 
are luxuries and are not necessary for the taxpayer or for members of 
his family, are not exempt from levy.
    (2) Fuel, provisions, furniture, and personal effects. If the 
taxpayer is the head of a family, so much of the fuel, provisions, 
furniture, and personal effects in his household, and of the arms for 
personal use, livestock, and poultry of the taxpayer, as does not exceed 
$1,650 ($1,550 for levies issued prior to January 1, 1990) in value. For 
purposes of this provision, an individual who is the only remaining 
member of a family and who lives alone is not the head of a family.
    (3) Books and tools of a trade, business or profession. So many of 
the books and tools necessary for the trade, business, or profession of 
an individual taxpayer as do not exceed in the aggregate $1,100 ($1,050 
for levies issued prior to January 1, 1990) in value.
    (4) Unemployment benefits. Any amount payable to an individual with

[[Page 226]]

respect to his unemployment (including any portion thereof payable with 
respect to dependents) under an unemployment compensation law of the 
United States, of any State, or of the District of Columbia or of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (5) Undelivered mail. Mail, addressed to any person, which has not 
been delivered to the addressee.
    (6) Certain annuity and pension payments. Annuity or pension 
payments under the Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. chapter 9), 
benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 
chapter 11), special pension payments received by a person whose name 
has been entered on the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard Medal of 
Honor roll (38 U.S.C. 562), and annuities based on retired or retainer 
pay under chapter 73 of title 10 of the United States Code.
    (7) Workmen's compensation. Any amount payable to an individual as 
workmen's compensation (including any portion thereof payable with 
respect to dependents) under a workmen's compensation law of the United 
States, any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico.
    (8) Judgments for support of minor children. If the taxpayer is 
required under any type of order or decree (including an interlocutory 
decree or a decree of support pendente lite) of a court of competent 
jurisdiction, entered prior to the date of levy, to contribute to the 
support of his minor children, so much of his salary, wages, or other 
income as is necessary to comply with such order or decree. The taxpayer 
must establish the amount necessary to comply with the order or decree. 
The district director is not required to release a levy until such time 
as he is satisfied that the amount to be released from levy will 
actually be applied in satisfaction of the support obligation. The 
district director may make arrangements with a delinquent taxpayer to 
establish a specific amount of such taxpayer's salary, wage, or other 
income for each pay period which shall be exempt from levy. Any request 
for such an arrangement shall be directed to the Chief, Special 
Procedures Staff, for the internal revenue district in which the 
taxpayer resides. Where the taxpayer has more than one source of income 
sufficient to satisfy the support obligation imposed by the order or 
decree, the amount exempt from levy may at the discretion of the 
district director be allocated entirely to one salary, wage, or source 
of other income or be apportioned between the several salaries, wages, 
or other sources of income.
    (9) Minimum exemption for wages, salary, and other income. Amounts 
payable to or received by the taxpayer as wages or salary for personal 
services, or as other income, to the extent provided in Sec. 301.6334-2 
through Sec. 301.6334-4.
    (10) Certain service-connected disability payments. Any amount 
payable to an individual as a service-connected (within the meaning of 
section 101(16) of title 38, United States Code (U.S.C.)) disability 
benefit under--
    (i) Subchapters II (wartime disability compensation), III (wartime 
death compensation), IV (peacetime disability compensation), V 
(peacetime death compensation), or VI (general compensation provisions) 
of chapter 11 of title 38, U.S.C.; or
    (ii) Chapters 13 (dependency and indemnity compensation for service 
commenced deaths), 21 (specially adapted housing for disabled veterans), 
23 (burial benefits), 31 (vocational rehabilitation), 32 (post-Vietnam 
era veterans' educational assistance), 34 (veterans' educational 
assistance), 35 (survivors' and dependents' educational assistance), 37 
(home, condominium, and mobile home loans), or 39 (automobiles and 
adaptive equipment for certain disabled veterans and members of the 
armed forces) of title 38, U.S.C.
    (11) Certain public assistance payments. Any amount payable to an 
individual as a recipient of public assistance under--
    (i) Title IV (relating to aid to families with dependent children)

seq.) from funds appropriated pursuant to such Act.
    (13) Principal residence exempt in absence of certain approval or 
jeopardy. Except to the extent provided in section 6334(e), the 
principal residence (within the meaning of section 1034) of the taxpayer 
whose tax liability is being sought to be collected upon.
    (b) Appraisal. The internal revenue officer seizing property of the 
type described in section 6334(a) shall appraise and set aside to the 
owner the amount of such property declared to be exempt. If the taxpayer 
objects at the time of the seizure to the valuation fixed by the officer 
making the seizure, such officer shall summon three disinterested 
individuals who shall make the valuation.
    (c) Other property. No other property or rights to property are 
exempt from levy except the property specifically exempted by section 
6334(a). No provision of a State law may exempt property or rights to 
property from levy for the collection of any Federal tax. Thus, property 
exempt from execution under State personal or homestead exemption laws 
is, nevertheless, subject to levy by the United States for collection of 
its taxes.
    (d) Levy allowed on principal residence. The principal residence of 
the taxpayer is not exempt from levy if--
    (1) A district director or an assistant district director personally 
approves, in writing, the levy on such property; or
    (2) The district director determines that the collection of tax is 
in jeopardy.
    (e) Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to 
levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by 
a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these 
regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the 
requirements of these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6334-2  Wages, salary, and other income.

    (a) In general. Under section 6334 (a)(9) and (d) certain amounts 
payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary, or other income 
are exempt from levy. This section describes the income of a taxpayer 
that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph (b) of this 
section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer 
(paragraph (c) of this section). Section 301.6334-3 describes that sum 
that will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's pay periods. 
Pay periods are described in Sec. 301.6334-3. For the amounts exempt 
from levy, see Sec. 301.6334-3.
    (b) Eligible taxpayer income. Only wages, salary, or other income 
payable to the taxpayer after the levy is made on the payor may be 
exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages, salary, 
or other income that is paid to the taxpayer before levy is made on the 
payor will be so exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). The 
provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following 
example:

    Example. Delinquent taxpayer A, an individual, is employed by the M 
Corporation and is paid wages on Friday of each week. Accordingly, A is 
paid wages on Friday, February 16, 1990. On Saturday, February 17, A 
deposits these wages into his personal checking account at Bank N. On 
Tuesday, February 20, a notice of levy is served on the M Corporation 
and also on Bank N. Amounts payable to A as wages on Friday, February 
23, 1990, and any payday thereafter may be exempt from levy under 
section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages A deposited in his account at 
Bank N on February 17, 1990, is exempt from levy under section 
6334(a)(9).

    (c) Payment of exempt amounts to taxpayer--(1) From wages, salary, 
or income from other sources where levy on all sources not made. In the 
case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary, or 
other income, the district director may elect to levy on only one or 
more sources while leaving other sources of income free from levy. If 
the wages, salary, or other income that the district director leaves 
free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is 
entitled as an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9), computed in 
accordance with

[[Page 228]]

Sec. 301.6334-3 (and are not otherwise exempt), the district director 
may treat no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income on 
which the district director elects to levy as exempt from levy. In such 
a case, the district director must notify the employer or other person 
upon whom the levy is served that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, 
salary, or other income is exempt from levy. The employer or other 
person upon whom the levy is served may rely on such notification in 
paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such 
notification from the district director, however, the employer or other 
person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt 
from levy pursuant to Sec. 301.6334-3 as if that employer or other 
person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, 
or other income. Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the 
district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The 
provisions of this paragraph (c)(1) may be illustrated by the following 
example:

    Example. Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and 
is paid wages totalling $450 on Friday of each week. C also performs 
services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $250 on Friday of 
each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on O 
Corporation with respect to the wages payable to C. A levy is not served 
on P Corporation. C's filing status is single and C is entitled to 1 
personal exemption. Under Sec. 301.6334-3, C is entitled to an exemption 
from levy under 6334(a)(9) totalling $101.92 for each weekly pay period. 
However, because levy has not been made on C's salary paid by the P 
Corporation ($250 per week) and that salary exceeds the weekly amount 
($101.92) to which C is entitled as exempt from levy, the district 
director may treat no amount of C's wages paid by the O Corporation as 
exempt from levy. If the district director requires such treatment, the 
district director must notify O Corporation that no amount of C's wages 
is exempt from levy and O Corporation may rely on such notification; in 
the absence of such notification O Corporation must treat $101.92 as 
exempt from levy.

    (2) Where sources not levied upon are less than exempt amount. If 
the taxpayer's income upon which the district director does not levy is 
less than the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as exempt from 
levy, then an additional amount, determined to be exempt from levy 
pursuant to Sec. 301.6334-3, may be paid to the taxpayer from the 
sources of wages, salary, or other income upon which levy has been made. 
In such a case, the district director must designate those wages, 
salary, or other income from which the exempt amount is to be paid to 
the taxpayer, and must notify the employer or other person upon whom the 
levy is served of the amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other 
income that is exempt from levy. The employer or other person may rely 
on such notification in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the 
absence of such notification from the district director, the employer or 
other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount 
exempt from levy pursuant to Sec. 301.6334-3 as if that employer or 
other person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, 
salary, or other income. Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to 
the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The 
provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following 
example:

    Example. Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and 
is paid wages totalling $50 on Friday of each week. C also performs 
services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $75 on Friday of each 
week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on P Corporation 
with respect to the wages and salary of C. C's filing status is single 
and C is entitled to 1 personal exemption. Under Sec. 301.6334-3, C is 
entitled to an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9) totalling 
$101.92 for each weekly pay period. The district director may notify P 
Corporation that only $51.92 of C's wages is exempt from levy and P 
Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such 
notification, P Corporation must treat the entire $75 salary as exempt 
from levy.

    (d) Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to 
levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by 
a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these 
regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the 
requirements of these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6334-3  Determination of exempt amount.

    (a) Individuals paid on weekly basis. In the case of any individual 
who is paid or receives all of his or her wages, salary, and other 
income on a weekly basis, the amount of wages, salary, and other income 
payable to or received by him or her during any week that is exempt from 
levy under section 6334(a)(9) is the exempt amount.
    (b) Term defined. The term exempt amount means an amount equal to--
    (1) The sum of--
    (i) The standard deduction (including additional standard deductions 
on account of age or blindness); and
    (ii) The aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions 
allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the taxable year in which such 
levy occurs;
    (2) Divided by 52.
    (c) Written and properly verified statement. Unless the taxpayer 
submits to the employer for forwarding to the district director a 
written and properly verified statement (as described in Sec. 301.6334-
4) specifying the facts necessary to determine the proper amount under 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, paragraphs (b)(1) (i) 
and (ii) of this section must be applied as if the taxpayer were a 
married individual filing a separate return with only 1 personal 
exemption.
    (d) Individuals paid on basis other than weekly--(1) In general. In 
the case of an individual who is paid or receives wages, salary, and 
other income other than on a weekly basis, the amount payable to that 
individual during any applicable pay period that is exempt from levy 
under section 6334(a)(9) is the amount that as nearly as possible will 
result in the same total exemption from levy for such individual over 
that period of time other than weekly as that to which the individual 
would have been entitled under paragraph (b) of this section if, during 
such period of time, the individual were paid or received such wages, 
salary, and other income on a regular weekly basis.
    (2) Specific pay periods other than weekly. In the case of wages, 
salary, or other income paid to an individual on the basis of an 
established calendar period regularly used by the employer or other 
person levied upon for payroll or payment purposes, the exempt amount of 
wages, salary, and other income payable to or received by an individual 
during an applicable pay period other than weekly equals--
    (i) The sum of--
    (A) The standard deduction (including additional standard deductions 
on account of age or blindness); and
    (B) The aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions 
allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the taxable year in which such 
levy occurs;
    (ii) Divided by--
    (A) 260 in the case of a daily pay period;
    (B) 26 in the case of a bi-weekly pay period;
    (C) 24 in the case of a semi-monthly pay period; and
    (D) 12 in the case of a monthly pay period.
    (3) Nonspecific pay periods. In the case of wages, salary, or other 
income paid to an individual on a one-time or a recurrent but irregular 
basis and which is not paid on the basis of an established calendar 
period regularly used by the employer or other person levied upon for 
payroll or payment purposes, the exempt amount of wages, salary, and 
other income payable to or received by an individual equals the exempt 
amount defined in paragraph (b) of this section multiplied by the number 
(but not more than 52) of full weeks (consisting of seven calendar days) 
to which such payment is attributable. The provisions of this paragraph 
(d)(3) may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. Taxpayer A's exempt amount per week (as determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section) is $100. Taxpayer A is hired by 
Corporation X to perform a specific task for Corporation X at a flat fee 
of $1,500 which is to be paid at the completion of the task. Taxpayer A 
completes the task in 10 weeks. The total exempt amount is $1,000 and 
$500 is subject to levy.

    (e) Levies continuing into following years. The exempt amount is 
computed on the basis of the standard deduction (including additional 
standard deductions on account of age or blindness) for the taxpayer's 
filing status and the amount of the deduction for a personal

[[Page 230]]

exemption in effect in the taxable year in which the original notice of 
levy is served. Unless the taxpayer submits a new verified statement in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6334-4, the exempt amount remains the same for 
pay periods following the pay period in which the notice of levy is 
served even if there is a change in the taxpayer's factual situation or 
a change by operation of law (such as by indexing or otherwise) to the 
standard deduction or personal exemption amounts.
    (f) Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to 
levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by 
a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these 
regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the 
requirements of these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6334-4  Verified statements.

    (a) In general. For purposes of Secs. 301.6334-2 and 301.6334-3, the 
amount of wages, salary, or other income that is exempt from levy must 
be determined on the basis of a written and properly verified statement 
submitted by the taxpayer to his or her employer for submission to the 
district director specifying the facts necessary to determine the 
standard deduction and the aggregate amount of the deductions for 
personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the 
taxable year in which the levy is served. In the absence of submission 
of such statement, the amount that is exempt from levy must be 
determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a 
separate return with only 1 personal exemption.
    (b) Content of statement. The statement in paragraph (a) of this 
section must be a written statement signed under penalty of perjury, and 
dated, containing the following information--
    (1) The filing status of the taxpayer as either:
    (i) Single;
    (ii) Married filing a joint return;
    (iii) Married filing a separate return;
    (iv) Head of household; or
    (v) Qualifying widow or widower with dependent child;
    (2) The name, relationship, and Social Security Number of each 
individual whom the taxpayer can claim as a personal exemption on the 
taxpayer's income tax return; and
    (3) Any additional standard deductions that the taxpayer can claim 
on account of age (65 or older) or blindness on the taxpayer's income 
tax return.
    (c) Submission of verified statement--(1) Obligation of employer. An 
employer upon whom a notice of levy for wages, salary, or other income 
of a taxpayer is served must promptly notify the taxpayer of the fact 
that a notice of levy has been served. Unless otherwise indicated on the 
face of the notice of levy, the employer must request the taxpayer to 
provide the employer with a written statement signed under penalty of 
perjury, and dated, containing the information set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section, and this statement must be submitted by the 
employer to the district director. The employer must submit this 
statement to the district director at the time the employer first 
responds to the notice of levy.
    (2) Submission by taxpayer. The taxpayer must provide the employer 
upon whom the notice of levy has been served with a verified statement 
complying with paragraph (b) of this section. Unless the taxpayer 
provides a verified statement, the amount that is exempt from levy must 
be determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a 
separate return with only 1 personal exemption.
    (3) Additional statements. A taxpayer may submit a verified 
statement to his or her employer at any time. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, such verified statement will 
be effective for any payment of wages, salary, or other income made 
after the date of submission and will replace any previously submitted 
verified statement. The employer must provide the district director with 
the statement on the next occasion on which the employer responds to the 
notice of levy.
    (d) Effect of verified statement--(1) A verified statement submitted 
by an employee is effective upon receipt by the employer, and the 
employer is required to compute the exempt amount

[[Page 231]]

on the basis of the information contained in the verified statement 
unless notified to the contrary by the Internal Revenue Service.
    (2) The Internal Revenue Service may find that a verified statement 
submitted by an employee contains a materially incorrect statement, or 
it may determine, after written request to the employee for verification 
of information contained in the verified statement, that it lacks 
sufficient information to determine whether the verified statement is 
correct. If the Internal Revenue Service so finds or determines, and 
notifies the employer in writing that the verified statement is 
defective, upon receipt of such notice the employer shall consider the 
verified statement to be defective for purposes of computing the exempt 
amount.
    (3) If the Internal Revenue Service notifies the employer that the 
verified statement is defective, the Internal Revenue Service will, 
based upon its finding, advise the employer that the employer is to 
compute the exempt amount as if no verified statement had been submitted 
by the employee or will describe upon what basis the exempt amount is to 
be computed. The Internal Revenue Service will also specify which 
Internal Revenue Service office to contact for further information.
    (4) In addition to any notice furnished to the employer for the 
employer's use, the Internal Revenue Service will provide the employer 
with a copy for the employee of each notice it furnishes the employer.
    (5) The employer must promptly furnish the employee with a copy of 
any Internal Revenue Service notice with respect to a verified statement 
submitted by the employee.
    (6) Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the employer must 
continue to compute the exempt amount on the basis of the written notice 
from the Internal Revenue Service until the Internal Revenue Service by 
written notice advises the employer to compute the exempt amount on the 
basis of a new verified statement (as described in paragraph (d)(7) of 
this section) and revokes its earlier written notice.
    (7) Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the employee may 
submit a new verified statement together with a written explanation of 
any circumstances of the employee which have changed since the Internal 
Revenue Service's earlier written notice, or any other circumstances or 
reasons as justification or support for the claims made by the employee 
on the new verified statement. The employee may submit the new verified 
statement and written explanation either--
    (i) To the Internal Revenue Service office specified in the notice 
furnished to the employer under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or
    (ii) To the employer, who must forward the new verified statement 
and written explanation to the Internal Revenue Service office specified 
in the notice earlier furnished to the employer on the next occasion on 
which the employer responds to the notice of levy.
    (e) Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to 
levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by 
a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these 
regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the 
requirements of these regulations.

Sec. 301.6335-1  Sale of seized property.

    (a) Notice of seizure. As soon as practicable after seizure of 
property, the internal revenue officer seizing the property shall give 
notice in writing to the owner of the property (or, in the case of 
personal property, to the possessor thereof). The written notice shall 
be delivered to the owner (or to the possessor, in the case of personal 
property) or left at his usual place of abode or business if he has such 
within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the 
owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business 
within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known 
address. Such notice shall specify the sum demanded and shall contain, 
in the case of personal property, a list sufficient to identify the 
property seized and, in the case of real property, a description with 
reasonable certainty of the property seized.

[[Page 232]]

    (b) Notice of sale. (1) As soon as practicable after seizure of the 
property, the district director shall give notice of sale in writing to 
the owner. Such notice shall be delivered to the owner or left at his 
usual place of abode or business if located within the internal revenue 
district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily 
located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, 
the notice may be mailed to his last known address. The notice shall 
specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and 
conditions of the sale thereof, and shall expressly state that only the 
right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to such 
property is to be offered for sale. The notice shall also be published 
in some newspaper published in the county wherein the seizure is made or 
in a newspaper generally circulated in that county. For example, if a 
newspaper of general circulation in a county but not published in that 
county will reach more potential bidders for the property to be sold 
than a newspaper published within the county, or if there is a newspaper 
of general circulation within the county but no newspaper published 
within the county, the district director may cause public notice of the 
sale to be given in the newspaper of general circulation within the 
county. If there is no newspaper published or generally circulated in 
the county, the notice shall be posted at the post office nearest the 
place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public 
places.
    (2) The district director may use other methods of giving notice of 
sale and of advertising seized property in addition to those referred to 
in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), when he believes that the 
nature of the property to be sold is such that a wider or more 
specialized advertising coverage will enhance the possibility of 
obtaining a higher price for the property.
    (3) Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period 
provided in section 6331(a) (relating to cases in which collection is in 
jeopardy), a public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be 
made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to 
perishable goods) is applicable.
    (c) Time, place, manner, and conditions of sale. The time, place, 
manner, and conditions of the sale of property seized by levy shall be 
as follows:
    (1) Time and place of sale. The time of sale shall not be less than 
10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice 
under section 6335(b) (see paragraph (b) of this section). The place of 
sale shall be within the county in which the property is seized, except 
that if it appears to the district director under whose supervision the 
seizure was made that substantially higher bids may be obtained for the 
property if the sale is held at a place outside such county, he may 
order that the sale be held in such other place. The sale shall be held 
at the time and place stated in the notice of sale.
    (2) Adjournment of sale. When it appears to the district director 
that an adjournment of the sale will best serve the interest of the 
United States or that of the taxpayer, the district director may 
adjourn, or cause the internal revenue officer conducting the sale to 
adjourn, the sale from time to time, but the date of the sale shall not 
be later than one month after the date fixed in the original notice of 
sale.
    (3) Determinations relating to minimum price--(i) Minimum price. 
Before the sale of property seized by levy, the district director shall 
determine a minimum price, taking into account the expenses of levy and 
sale, for which the property shall be sold. The internal revenue officer 
conducting the sale may either announce the minimum price before the 
sale begins, or defer announcement of the minimum price until after the 
receipt of the highest bid, in which case, if the highest bid is greater 
than the minimum price, no announcement of the minimum price shall be 
made.
    (ii) Purchase by the United States. Before the sale of property 
seized by levy, the district director shall determine whether the 
purchase of property by the United States at the minimum price would be 
in the best interest of the United States. In determining whether the 
purchase of property would be in the best interest of the United States, 
the district director

[[Page 233]]

may consider all relevant facts and circumstances including for 
example--
    (a) Marketability of the property;
    (b) Cost of maintaining the property;
    (c) Cost of repairing or restoring the property;
    (d) Cost of transporting the property;
    (e) Cost of safeguarding the property;
    (f) Cost of potential toxic waste cleanup; and
    (g) Other factors pertinent to the type of property.
    (iii) Effective date. This paragraph (c)(3) applies to 
determinations relating to minimum price made on or after December 17, 
1996.
    (4) Disposition of property at sale--(i) Sale to highest bidder at 
or above minimum price. If one or more persons offer to buy the property 
for at least the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be sold 
to the highest bidder.
    (ii) Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price. If no 
one offers at least the amount of the minimum price for the property and 
the Secretary has determined that it would be in the best interest of 
the United States to purchase the property for the minimum price, the 
property shall be declared to be sold to the United States for the 
minimum price.
    (iii) Release to owner. If the property is not declared to be sold 
under paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, the property shall be 
released to the owner of the property and the expense of the levy and 
sale shall be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the 
United States made the levy. Any property released under this paragraph 
(c)(4)(iii) shall remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C of 
chapter 64 of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (iv) Effective date. This paragraph (c)(4) applies to dispositions 
of property at sale made on or after December 17, 1996.
    (5) Offering of property--(i) Sale of indivisible property. If any 
property levied upon is not divisible, so as to enable the district 
director by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax 
and expenses of levy and sale, the whole of such property shall be sold. 
For application of surplus proceeds of sale, see section 6342(b).
    (ii) Separately, in groups, or in the aggregate. The seized property 
may be offered for sale--
    (a) As separate items, or
    (b) As groups of items, or
    (c) In the aggregate, or
    (d) Both as separate items (or in groups) and in the aggregate. In 
such cases, the property shall be sold under the method which produces 
the highest aggregate amount.

The district director shall select whichever of the foregoing methods of 
offering the property for sale as, in his opinion, is most feasible 
under all the facts and circumstances of the case, except that if the 
property to be sold includes both real and personal property, only the 
personal property may be grouped for the purpose of offering such 
property for sale. However, real and personal property may be offered 
for sale in the aggregate, provided the real property, as separate 
items, and the personal property as a group, or as groups, or as 
separate items, are first offered separately.
    (iii) Condition of title and of property. Only the right, title, and 
interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to the property seized shall 
be offered for sale, and such interest shall be offered subject to any 
prior outstanding mortgages, encumbrances, or other liens in favor of 
third parties which are valid as against the delinquent taxpayer and are 
superior to the lien of the United States. All seized property shall be 
offered for sale ``as is'' and ``where is'' and without recourse against 
the United States. No guaranty or warranty, express or implied, shall be 
made by the internal revenue officer offering the property for sale, as 
to the validity of the title, quality, quantity, weight, size, or 
condition of any of the property, or its fitness for any use or purpose. 
No claim shall be considered for allowance or adjustment or for 
rescission of the sale based upon failure of the property to conform 
with any representation, express or implied.
    (iv) Terms of payment. The property shall be offered for sale upon 
whichever of the following terms is fixed by the district director in 
the public notice of sale:

[[Page 234]]

    (a) Payment in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, without 
regard to the amount of such bid, or
    (b) If the aggregate price of all property purchased by a successful 
bidder at the sale is more than $200, an initial payment of $200 or 20 
percent of the purchase price, whichever is the greater, and payment of 
the balance (including all costs incurred for the protection or 
preservation of the property subsequent to the sale and prior to final 
payment) within a specified period, not to exceed 1 month from the date 
of the sale.
    (6) Method of sale. The district director shall sell the property 
either--
    (i) At public auction, at which open competitive bids shall be 
received, or
    (ii) At public sale under sealed bids. The following rules, in 
addition to the other rules provided in this paragraph, shall be 
applicable to public sale under sealed bids:
    (a) Invitation to bidders. Bids shall be solicited through a public 
notice of sale.
    (b) Form for use by bidders. A bid shall be submitted on a form 
which will be furnished by the district director upon request. The form 
shall be completed in accordance with the instructions thereon.
    (c) Remittance with bid. If the total bid is $200 or less, the full 
amount of the bid shall be submitted therewith. If the total bid is more 
than $200, 20 percent of such bid or $200, whichever is greater, shall 
be submitted therewith. (In the case of alternative bids submitted by 
the same bidder for items of property offered separately, or in groups, 
or in the aggregate, the bidder shall remit the full amount of the 
highest alternative bid submitted, if that bid is $200 or less. If the 
highest alternative bid submitted is more than $200, the bidder shall 
remit 20 percent of the highest alternative bid or $200, whichever is 
greater.) Such remittance shall be by a certified, cashier's, or 
treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under 
the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, 
or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, 
or telegraph money order.
    (d) Time for receiving and opening bids. Each bid shall be submitted 
in a securely sealed envelope. The bidder shall indicate in the upper 
left hand corner of the envelope his name and address and the time and 
place of sale as announced in the public notice of sale. A bid will not 
be considered unless it is received by the internal revenue officer 
conducting the sale prior to the opening of the bids. The bids will be 
opened at the time and place stated in the notice of sale, or at the 
time fixed in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.
    (e) Consideration of bids. The public notice of sale shall specify 
whether the property is to be sold separately, by groups, or in the 
aggregate or by a combination of these methods, as provided in 
subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph. If the notice specifies an 
alternative method, bidders may submit bids under one or more of the 
alternatives. In case of error in the extension of prices in any bid, 
the unit price will govern. The internal revenue officer conducting the 
sale shall have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. In 
the event two or more highest bids are equal in amount, the internal 
revenue officer conducting the sale shall determine the successful 
bidder by drawing lots. After the opening, examination, and 
consideration of all bids, the internal revenue officer conducting the 
sale shall announce the amount of the highest bid or bids and the name 
of the successful bidder or bidders. Any remittance submitted in 
connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned at the conclusion 
of the sale.
    (f) Withdrawal of bids. A bid may be withdrawn on written or 
telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for 
opening the bids. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the 
bidder for the withdrawal of his bid after it has been opened.
    (7) Payment of bid price. All payments for property sold under this 
section shall be made by cash or by a certified, cashier's, or 
treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under 
the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, 
or possession of the United

[[Page 235]]

States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order. If 
payment in full is required upon acceptance of the highest bid, the 
payment shall be made at such time. If deferred payment is permitted, 
the initial payment shall be made upon acceptance of the bid, and the 
balance shall be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof. 
Any remittance submitted with a successful sealed bid shall be applied 
toward the purchase price.
    (8) Delivery and removal of personal property. Responsibility of the 
United States for the protection or preservation of seized personal 
property shall cease immediately upon acceptance of the highest bid. The 
risk of loss is on the purchaser of personal property upon acceptance of 
his bid. Possession of any personal property shall not be delivered to 
the purchaser until the purchase price has been paid in full. If payment 
of part of the purchase price for personal property is deferred, the 
United States will retain possession of such property as security for 
the payment of the balance of the purchase price and, as agent for the 
purchaser, will cause the property to be cared for until the purchase 
price has been paid in full or the sale is declared null and void for 
failure to make full payment of the purchase price. In such case, all 
charges and expenses incurred in caring for the property after the 
acceptance of the bid shall be borne by the purchaser.
    (9) Default in payment. If payment in full is required upon 
acceptance of the bid and is not then and there paid, the internal 
revenue officer conducting the sale shall forthwith proceed again to 
sell the property in the manner provided in section 6335(e) and this 
section. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be 
deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, 
suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or 
such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the 
rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the 
discretion of the district director, the sale may be declared by the 
district director to be null and void for failure to make full payment 
of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold 
as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (e) of section 6335 and this 
section. In the event of such readvertisement and sale, any new 
purchaser shall receive such property or rights to property free and 
clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any 
nature whatsoever, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such 
defaulting purchaser shall be forfeited to the United States.
    (10) Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision. For 
restrictions on sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision, see 
section 6863(b)(3) and Sec. 301.6863-2.
    (d) Right to request the sale of seized property--(1) In general. 
The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the district 
director sell such property within 60 days after such request, or within 
any longer period specified by the owner. The district director must 
comply with such a request unless the district director determines that 
compliance with the request is not in the best interests of the Internal 
Revenue Service and notifies the owner of such determination within the 
60 day period, or any longer period specified by the owner.
    (2) Procedures to request the sale of seized property--(i) Manner. A 
request for the sale of seized property shall be made in writing to the 
group manager of the revenue officer whose signature is on Levy Form 
668-B. If the owner does not know the group manager's name or address, 
the owner may send the request to the revenue officer, marked for the 
attention of his or her group manager.
    (ii) Form. The request for sale of seized property within 60 days, 
or such longer period specified by the owner, shall include:
    (A) The name, current address, current home and work telephone 
numbers and any convenient times to be contacted, and taxpayer 
identification number of the owner making the request;
    (B) A description of the seized property that is the subject of the 
request;
    (C) A copy of the notice of seizure, if available;
    (D) The period within which the owner is requesting that the 
property be sold; and

[[Page 236]]

    (E) The signature of the owner or duly authorized representative. 
For purposes of these regulations, a duly authorized representative is 
any attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled actuary, or any 
other person permitted to represent the owner before the Internal 
Revenue Service who is not disbarred or suspended from practice before 
the Internal Revenue Service and who has written power of attorney 
executed by the owner.
    (3) Notification to owner. The group manager shall respond in 
writing to a request for sale of seized property as soon as practicable 
after receipt of such request and in no event later than 60 days after 
receipt of the request, or, if later, the date specified by the owner 
for the sale.

Sec. 301.6336-1   Sale of perishable goods.

    (a) Appraisal of certain seized property. If the district director 
determines that any property seized by levy is liable to perish or 
become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or that such 
property cannot be kept without great expense, he shall appraise the 
value of such property and return it to the owner if the owner complies 
with the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section or, if 
the owner does not comply with such conditions, dispose of the property 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Return to owner. If the owner of the property can be readily 
found, the district director shall give him written notice of his 
determination of the appraised value of the property. However, if the 
district director determines that the circumstances require immediate 
action, he may give the owner an oral notice of his determination of the 
appraised value of the property, which notice shall be confirmed in 
writing prior to sale. The property shall be returned to the owner if, 
within the time specified in the notice, the owner--
    (1) Pays to the district director an amount equal to the appraised 
value, or
    (2) Gives an acceptable bond as prescribed by section 7101 and 
Sec. 301.7101-1. Such bond shall be in an amount not less than the 
appraised value of the property and shall be conditioned upon the 
payment of such amount at such time as the district director determines 
to be appropriate in the circumstances.
    (c) Immediate sale. If the owner does not pay the amount of the 
appraised value of the seized property within the time specified in the 
notice, or furnish bond as provided in paragraph (b) of this section 
within such time, the district director shall as soon as practicable 
make public sale of the property in accordance with the following terms 
and conditions--
    (1) Notice of sale. If the owner can readily be found, a notice 
shall be given to him. A notice of sale also shall be posted in two 
public places in the county in which the property is to be sold. The 
notice shall specify the time and place of sale, the property to be 
sold, and the manner and conditions of sale. The district director may 
give such other notice and in such other manner as he deems advisable 
under the circumstances.
    (2) Sale. The property shall be sold at public auction to the 
highest bidder.
    (3) Terms. The purchase price shall be paid in full upon acceptance 
of the highest bid. The payment shall be made in cash, or by a 
certified, cashier's or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust 
company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the 
laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by 
a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6337-1   Redemption of property.

    (a) Before sale. Any person whose property has been levied upon 
shall have the right to pay the amount due, together with costs and 
expenses of the proceeding, if any, to the district director at any time 
prior to the sale of the property. Upon such payment the district 
director shall restore such property to the owner and all further 
proceedings in connection with the levy on such property shall cease 
from the time of such payment.
    (b) Redemption of real estate after sale--(1) Period. The owner of 
any real estate sold as provided in section 6335,

[[Page 237]]

his heirs, executors, or administrators, or any person having any 
interest therein, or a lien thereon, or any person in their behalf, 
shall be permitted to redeem the property sold, or any particular tract 
of such property, at any time within 120 days after the sale thereof.
    (2) Price. Such property or tract of property may be redeemed upon 
payment to the purchaser, or in case he cannot be found in the county in 
which the property to be redeemed is situated, then to the district 
director for the internal revenue district in which the property is 
situated, for the use of the purchaser, his heirs, or assigns, the 
amount paid by such purchaser and interest thereon at the rate of 20 
percent per annum. In case real and personal property (or several tracts 
of real property) are purchased in the aggregate, the redemption price 
of the real property (or of each of the several tracts) shall be 
determined on the basis of the ratio, as of the time of sale, of the 
value of the real property (or tract) to the value of the total property 
purchased. For this purpose the minimum price or the highest bid price, 
whichever is higher, offered for the property separately or in groups 
shall be treated as the value.
    (c) Record. When any real property is redeemed, the district 
director shall cause entry of the fact to be made upon the record of 
sale kept in accordance with section 6340, and such entry shall be 
evidence of such redemption. The party who redeems the property shall 
notify the district director of the internal revenue district in which 
the property is situated of the date of such redemption and of the 
transfer of the certificate of sale, the amount of the redemption price, 
and the name of the party to whom such redemption price was paid.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6338-1   Certificate of sale; deed of real property.

    (a) Certificate of sale. In the case of property sold as provided in 
section 6335 (relating to sale of seized property), the district 
director shall give to the purchaser a certificate of sale upon payment 
in full of the purchase price. A certificate of sale of real property 
shall set forth the real property purchased, for whose taxes the same 
was sold, the name of the purchaser, and the price paid therefor.
    (b) Deed to real property. In the case of any real property sold as 
provided in section 6335 and not redeemed in the manner and within the 
time prescribed in section 6337, the district director shall execute (in 
accordance with the laws of the State in which the real property is 
situated pertaining to sales of real property under execution) to the 
purchaser of such real property at the sale or his assigns, upon 
surrender of the certificate of sale, a deed of the real property so 
purchased, reciting the facts set forth in the certificate.
    (c) Deed to real property purchased by the United States. If real 
property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant 
to section 6335, the district director shall at the proper time execute 
a deed therefor and shall, without delay, cause the deed to be duly 
recorded in the proper registry of deeds.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6339-1   Legal effect of certificate of sale of personal property and deed of real property.

    (a) Certificate of sale of property other than real property. In all 
cases of sale pursuant to section 6335 of property (other than real 
property), the certificate of such sale--
    (1) As evidence. Shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the 
officer to make such sale, and conclusive evidence of the regularity of 
his proceedings in making the sale; and
    (2) As conveyance. Shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, 
and interest of the party delinquent in and to the property sold; and
    (3) As authority for transfer of corporate stock. If such property 
consists of corporate stocks, shall be notice, when received, to any 
corporation, company, or association of such transfer, and shall be 
authority to such corporation, company, or association to record the 
transfer on its books and records in the same manner as if the stocks 
were transferred or assigned by the party holding the stock certificate,

[[Page 238]]

in lieu of any original or prior certificate, which shall be void, 
whether canceled or not; and
    (4) As receipts. If the subject of sale is securities or other 
evidences of debt, shall be a good and valid receipt to the person 
holding the certificate of sale as against any person holding or 
claiming to hold possession of such securities or other evidences of 
debt; and
    (5) As authority for transfer of title to motor vehicle. If such 
property consists of a motor vehicle, shall be notice, when received, to 
any public official charged with the registration of title to motor 
vehicles, of such transfer and shall be authority to such official to 
record the transfer on his books and records in the same manner as if 
the certificate of title to such motor vehicle were transferred or 
assigned by the party holding the certificate of title, in lieu of any 
original or prior certificate, which shall be null and void, whether 
canceled or not.
    (b) Deed to real property. In the case of the sale of real property 
pursuant to section 6335--
    (1) Deed as evidence. The deed of sale given pursuant to section 
6338 shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated; and
    (2) Deed as conveyance of title. If the proceedings of the district 
director as set forth have been substantially in accordance with the 
provisions of law, such deed shall be considered and operate as a 
conveyance of all the right, title, and interest the party delinquent 
had in and to the real property thus sold at the time the lien of the 
United States attached thereto.
    (c) Effect of junior encumbrances. A certificate of sale of personal 
property given or a deed to real property executed pursuant to section 
6338 discharges the property from all liens, encumbrances, and titles 
over which the lien of the United States, with respect to which the levy 
was made, has priority. For example, a mortgage on real property 
executed after a notice of a Federal tax lien has been filed is 
extinguished when the district director executes a deed to the real 
property to a purchaser thereof at a sale pursuant to section 6335 
following the seizure of the property by the United States. The proceeds 
of such a sale are distributed in accordance with priority of the liens, 
encumbrances, or titles. See section 6342(b) and the regulations 
thereunder for provisions relating to the distribution of surplus 
proceeds. See section 7426(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder for 
judicial procedures with respect to surplus proceeds.

Sec. 301.6340-1   Records of sale.

    (a) Requirement. Each district director shall keep a record of all 
sales under section 6335 of real property situated within his district 
and of redemptions of such property. The records shall set forth (1) the 
tax for which any such sale was made, the dates of seizure and sale, the 
name of the party assessed and all proceedings in making such sale, the 
amount of expenses, the names of the purchasers, the date of the deed, 
and, in the case of redemption of the property, (2) the date of such 
redemption and of the transfer of the certificate of sale, the amount of 
the redemption price, and the name of the party to whom such redemption 
price was paid.
    (b) Copy as evidence. A copy of such record, or any part thereof, 
certified by the district director shall be evidence in any court of the 
truth of the facts therein stated.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6341-1   Expense of levy and sale.

    The district director shall determine the expenses to be allowed in 
all cases of levy and sale. Such expenses shall include the expenses of 
protection and preservation of the property during the period subsequent 
to the levy, as well as the actual expenses incurred in connection with 
the sale thereof. In case real and personal property (or several tracts 
of real property) are sold in the aggregate, the district director shall 
properly apportion the expenses to the real property (or to each tract).


<R05>
Sec. 301.6342-1   Application of proceeds of levy.

    (a) Collection of liability. Any money realized by proceedings under 
subchapter D, chapter 64, of the Code or by sale of property redeemed by 
the United States (if the interest of the United

[[Page 239]]

States in the property was a lien arising under the provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code), is applied in the manner specified in 
subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph (a). Money realized by 
proceedings under subchapter D, chapter 64, of the Code includes money 
realized by seizure, by sale of seized property, or by surrender under 
section 6332 (except money realized by the imposition of a 50 percent 
penalty pursuant to section 6332(c)(2)).
    (1) Expense of levy and sale. First, against the expenses of the 
proceedings or sale, including expenses allowable under section 6341 and 
amounts paid by the United States to redeem property.
    (2) Specific tax liability on seized property. If the property 
seized and sold is subject to a tax imposed by any internal revenue law 
which has not been paid, the amount remaining after applying 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), shall then be applied against 
such tax liability (and, if such tax was not previously assessed, it 
shall then be assessed);
    (3) Liability of delinquent taxpayer. The amount, if any, remaining 
after applying subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (a), shall 
then be applied against the liability in respect of which the levy was 
made or the sale of redeemed property was conducted.
    (b) Surplus proceeds. Any surplus proceeds remaining after the 
application of paragraph (a) of this section shall, upon application and 
satisfactory proof in support thereof, be credited or refunded by the 
district director to the person or persons legally entitled thereto. The 
delinquent taxpayer is the person entitled to the surplus proceeds 
unless another person establishes a superior claim thereto.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6343-1  Requirement to release levy and notice of release.

    (a) In general. A district director, service center director, or 
compliance center director (director) must promptly release a levy upon 
all, or part of, property or rights to property levied upon and must 
promptly notify the person upon whom the levy was made of such a 
release, if the director determines that any of the conditions in 
paragraph (b) of this section (conditions requiring release) exist. The 
director must make a determination whether any of the conditions 
requiring release exist if a taxpayer submits a request for release of 
levy in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section; however, 
the director may make this determination based upon information received 
from a source other than the taxpayer. The director may require any 
supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary to determine whether 
a condition requiring release exists.
    (b) Conditions requiring release. The director must release the levy 
upon all or a part of the property or rights to property levied upon if 
he or she determines that one of the following conditions exists--
    (1) Liability satisfied or unenforceable--(i) General rule. The 
liability for which the levy was made is satisfied or the period of 
limitations provided in section 6502 (and any period during which the 
period of limitations is suspended as provided by law) has lapsed. A 
levy is considered made on the date on which the notice of seizure 
provided in section 6335(a) is given. A levy that is made within the 
period of limitations provided in section 6502 does not become 
unenforceable simply because the person who receives the levy does not 
surrender the subject property within the period of limitations. In this 
case, the liability remains enforceable to the extent of the value of 
the levied upon property. However, a levy made outside the period of 
limitations (normally ten years without suspensions) must be released 
unless--
    (A) The taxpayer agreed in writing to extend the period of 
limitations as provided in section 6502(a)(2) and Sec. 301.6502-1; or
    (B) A proceeding in court to collect the liability has begun within 
the period of limitations.
    (ii) Special situations. A continuing levy on salary or wages made 
under section 6331(e) must be released at the end of the period of 
limitations in section 6502. However, a levy on a fixed and determinable 
right to payment which right includes payments to be made after the 
period of limitations expires does not become unenforceable

[[Page 240]]

upon the expiration of the period of limitations and will not be 
released under this condition unless the liability is satisfied.
    (2) Release will facilitate collection. The release of the levy will 
facilitate collection of the liability. A director has the discretion to 
release the levy in all situations, including those where the proceeds 
from the sale will not fully satisfy the tax liabilities of the 
taxpayer, under terms and conditions as he or she determines are 
warranted.
    (i) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
this paragraph (b)(2):

    Example. A and B each own machines which, when used together, 
produce widgets. A owes delinquent federal taxes. A notice of federal 
tax lien is properly filed against all property or rights to property 
belonging to A. A's machine is seized to satisfy A's delinquent tax 
liability. The fair market value of A's property is greater than the 
expenses of seizure and sale, but less than the amount of A's tax 
liability. A and B find a buyer who wants to buy both machines together. 
The buyer will only buy the machines together. A's property has a 
greater value as part of the package than it does by itself. The larger 
value, as shown in the sale contract, is enough to pay A's tax liability 
in full. In this situation a release of the levy will facilitate 
collection because the sale of both machines can be completed and A's 
liability will be paid in full at the settlement.

    (ii) Compliance with other conditions. The director may find that 
collection will be facilitated by the taxpayer's compliance with 
conditions other than immediate payment, such as:
    (A) The delinquent taxpayer delivers a satisfactory arrangement, 
which is accepted by the director, for placing property in escrow to 
secure the payment of the liability (including the expenses of the levy) 
which is the basis of the levy.
    (B) The delinquent taxpayer delivers an acceptable bond to the 
director conditioned upon the payment of the liability (including the 
expenses of levy) which is the basis of the levy. This bond shall be in 
the form provided in section 7101 and Sec. 301.7101-1.
    (C) There is paid to the director an amount determined by the 
director to be equal to the interest of the United States in the seized 
property or the part of the seized property to be released.
    (D) The delinquent taxpayer executes an agreement to extend the 
statute of limitations in accordance with section 6502(a)(2) and 
Sec. 301.6502-1.
    (iii) Expenses of sale exceed the government's interest. If the 
director determines that the value of the United States' interest in the 
seized property does not exceed the expenses of sale of the property, a 
release of the levy will be deemed to facilitate collection of the 
liability even though the fair market value of property which has been 
seized exceeds the expenses of seizure and sale.
    (3) Installment agreement. The taxpayer has entered into an 
agreement under section 6159 to satisfy the liability by means of 
installment payments, unless the agreement provides otherwise. However, 
the director is not required to release the levy under this condition if 
a release of the levy will jeopardize the secured creditor status of the 
United States, e.g., where there is an intervening judgment lien 
creditor and a notice of tax lien has not been filed.
    (4) Economic hardship--(i) General rule. The levy is creating an 
economic hardship due to the financial condition of an individual 
taxpayer. This condition applies if satisfaction of the levy in whole or 
in part will cause an individual taxpayer to be unable to pay his or her 
reasonable basic living expenses. The determination of a reasonable 
amount for basic living expenses will be made by the director and will 
vary according to the unique circumstances of the individual taxpayer. 
Unique circumstances, however, do not include the maintenance of an 
affluent or luxurious standard of living.
    (ii) Information from taxpayer. In determining a reasonable amount 
for basic living expenses the director will consider any information 
provided by the taxpayer including--
    (A) The taxpayer's age, employment status and history, ability to 
earn, number of dependents, and status as a dependent of someone else;
    (B) The amount reasonably necessary for food, clothing, housing 
(including utilities, home-owner insurance, home-

[[Page 241]]

owner dues, and the like), medical expenses (including health 
insurance), transportation, current tax payments (including federal, 
state, and local), alimony, child support, or other court-ordered 
payments, and expenses necessary to the taxpayer's production of income 
(such as dues for a trade union or professional organization, or child 
care payments which allow the taxpayer to be gainfully employed);
    (C) The cost of living in the geographic area in which the taxpayer 
resides;
    (D) The amount of property exempt from levy which is available to 
pay the taxpayer's expenses;
    (E) Any extraordinary circumstances such as special education 
expenses, a medical catastrophe, or natural disaster; and
    (F) Any other factor that the taxpayer claims bears on economic 
hardship and brings to the attention of the director.
    (iii) Good faith requirement. In addition, in order to obtain a 
release of a levy under this subparagraph, the taxpayer must act in good 
faith. Examples of failure to act in good faith include, but are not 
limited to, falsifying financial information, inflating actual expenses 
or costs, or failing to make full disclosure of assets.
    (5) Fair market value exceeds liability. The fair market value of 
the property exceeds the liability for which the levy was made and 
release of the levy on a part of the property can be made without 
hindering the collection of the liability. The following example 
illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b)(5):

    Example. The Internal Revenue Service levies upon ten widgets which 
belong to the taxpayer to satisfy the taxpayer's outstanding tax 
liabilities. Subsequent to the levy, the taxpayer establishes that 
market conditions have increased the aggregate fair market value of 
widgets so that the value of seven widgets equals the aggregate 
anticipated expenses of sale and seizure and the tax liabilities for 
which the levy was made. The director must release three widgets from 
the levy and return them to the taxpayer.

    (c) Request for release of levy--(1) Information to be submitted by 
taxpayer. A taxpayer who wishes to obtain a release of a levy must 
submit a request for release in writing or by telephone to the district 
director for the Internal Revenue district in which the levy was made. 
The taxpayer making the request must provide the following information--
    (i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
taxpayer;
    (ii) A description of the property levied upon;
    (iii) The type of tax and the period for which the tax is due;
    (iv) The date of the levy and the originating Internal Revenue 
district, if known; and
    (v) A statement of the grounds upon which the request for release of 
the levy is based.
    (2) Time for submission. Except in extraordinary circumstances, a 
request for release of a levy must be made more than five days prior to 
a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy relates.
    (3) Determination by director--(i) When required. The director must 
promptly make a determination concerning release prior to sale in all 
cases where a request for release of a levy is made except those where 
the request for release is made five or fewer days prior to a scheduled 
sale of the property to which the levy relates.
    (ii) Time for making required determination. The determination will 
be made, generally, within 30 days of a request for release made 30 or 
more days prior to a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy 
relates. If a request for release is made less than 30 days prior to the 
scheduled sale but more than 5 days before the scheduled sale, a 
determination must be made prior to the scheduled sale. If necessary the 
director may postpone the scheduled sale in order to make this 
determination.
    (iii) Discretionary determination. The director has the discretion, 
but is not required, to make a determination concerning release prior to 
sale in cases where a request for release of a levy is made five or 
fewer days prior to a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy 
relates.
    (4) Notification to taxpayer of determination. The director must 
promptly notify the taxpayer if the levy is released. If the director 
determines that

[[Page 242]]

none of the conditions requiring release of the levy exist, the director 
must promptly notify the taxpayer of the decision not to release the 
levy and the reason why the levy is not being released.
    (d) Expedited determination with respect to certain business 
property--(1) General procedure--(i) Submission by taxpayer. If a levy 
is made on essential business property as is described in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the taxpayer may obtain an expedited 
determination of whether any of the conditions requiring release of the 
levy exist. In order to obtain an expedited determination, the taxpayer 
must submit, within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the information required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
and include with the information an explanation of why the property 
levied upon qualifies for an expedited determination of whether a 
condition requiring release of the levy exists.
    (ii) Time for making required determination. The director must make 
such a determination by the later of 10 business days from the time the 
director receives the request for release, or 10 business days from the 
time the director receives any necessary supporting documentation, if 10 
or more business days remain before a scheduled sale of the property to 
which the levy relates. An expedited determination concerning release 
must be made prior to sale in all cases where a request for release of a 
levy is made within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. If necessary the director may postpone the scheduled sale in 
order to make this determination.
    (iii) Discretionary determination. The director has the discretion, 
but is not required, to make an expedited determination concerning 
release in cases where the taxpayer does not submit, within the time 
frame specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the information 
required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and include with the 
information an explanation of why the property levied upon qualifies for 
an expedited determination of whether a condition requiring release of 
the levy exists.
    (2) Essential business property defined. For purposes of this 
section, essential business property means tangible personal property 
used in carrying on the trade or business of the taxpayer which when 
levied upon prevents the taxpayer from continuing to carry on the trade 
or business.
    (3) Seizure of perishable goods. The provisions of this paragraph do 
not apply in the case of a seizure of perishable goods. Those seizures 
are governed by the provisions of section 6336 and Sec. 301.6336-1.
    (e) Effect of a release of levy. If property has not yet been 
surrendered to the director in response to a levy, a release of the levy 
under section 6343(a) will relieve the possessor of any obligation to 
surrender the property. Otherwise, a release of a levy under section 
6343(a) will cause the property to be returned to the custody of the 
person or persons legally entitled thereto. The release of a levy on any 
property under this section does not prevent any subsequent levy on the 
property. Section 301.6343-2, dealing with return of wrongfully levied 
upon property, is subject to section 6402 which prohibits the Internal 
Revenue Service from refunding a payment of money that has been 
deposited in the Treasury and credited to the taxpayer's liability 
unless there is an overpayment.
    (f) Effective date. This section is effective as of December 30, 
1994.

[T.D. 8587, 59 FR 35, Jan. 3, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6343-2  Return of wrongfully levied upon property.

    (a) Return of property--(1) General rule. If the district director, 
service center director, or compliance center director (the director) 
determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, the director 
may return--
    (i) The specific property levied upon;
    (ii) An amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon; or
    (iii) An amount of money equal to the amount of money received by 
the United States from a sale of the property.
    (2) Time of return. If the United States is in possession of 
specific property, the property may be returned at any time. An amount 
equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from

[[Page 243]]

a sale of the property may be returned at any time before the expiration 
of 9 months from the date of the levy. When a request described in 
paragraph (b) of this section is filed for the return of property before 
the expiration of 9 months from the date of levy, an amount of money may 
be returned after a reasonable period of time subsequent to the 
expiration of the 9-month period if necessary for the investigation and 
processing of such request.
    (3) Specific property. In general the specific property levied upon 
will be returned whenever possible. For this purpose, money that is 
specifically identifiable, as in the case of a coin collection which may 
be worth substantially more than its face value, is treated as specific 
property.
    (4) Purchase by United States. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) 
of this section, if property is declared purchased by the United States 
at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e), the United States is treated as 
having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined 
by the director before the sale or, if larger, the amount received by 
the United States from the resale of the property.
    (b) Request for return of property. A written request for the return 
of property wrongfully levied upon must be addressed to the district 
director (marked for the attention of the Chief, Special Procedures 
Staff) for the Internal Revenue district in which the levy was made. The 
written request must contain the following information--
    (1) The name and address of the person submitting the request;
    (2) A detailed description of the property levied upon;
    (3) A description of the claimant's basis for claiming an interest 
in the property levied upon; and
    (4) The name and address of the taxpayer, the originating Internal 
Revenue district, and the date of the levy as shown on the notice of 
levy form, or levy form, or, in lieu thereof, a statement of the reasons 
why such information cannot be furnished.
    (c) Inadequate request. A request for the return of property 
wrongfully levied upon will not be considered adequate unless it is a 
written request containing the information required by paragraph (b) of 
this section. However, unless a notification is mailed by the director 
to the claimant within 30 days of receipt of the request to inform the 
claimant of the inadequacies, any written request will be considered 
adequate. If the director timely notifies the claimant of the 
inadequacies of his request, the claimant has 30 days from the receipt 
of the notification of inadequacy to supply in writing any omitted 
information. Where the omitted information is so supplied within the 30-
day period, the request will be considered to be adequate from the time 
the original request was made for purposes of determining the applicable 
period of limitation upon suit under section 6532(c).
    (d) Payment of interest. Interest is paid at the overpayment rate 
established under section 6621--
    (1) In the case of money returned under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section, from the date the director received the money to a date (to be 
determined by the director) preceding the date of return by not more 
than 30 days; or
    (2) In the case of money returned under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of 
this section, from the date of the sale of the property to a date (to be 
determined by the director) preceding the date of return by not more 
than 30 days.
    (e) Effective date. This section is effective as of December 30, 
1994.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6361-1  Collection and administration of qualified taxes.

    (a) In general. In the case of any State which has in effect a State 
agreement (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6361-4), the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall collect and administer each 
qualified tax (as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6361-4) of such 
State. No fee or other charge shall be imposed upon any State for the 
collection or administration of any qualified tax of such State or any 
other State. In any such case of collection and administration of 
qualified taxes, the provisions of subtitle F (relating to procedure and 
administration), subtitle G (relating to the Joint Committee on 
Taxation), and chapter 24 (relating to the collection of income tax at 
source

[[Page 244]]

on wages), and the provisions of regulations thereunder, insofar as such 
provisions relate to the collection and administration of the taxes 
imposed on the income of individuals by chapter 1 (and the civil and 
criminal sanctions provided by subtitle F, or by title 18 of the United 
States Code (relating to crimes and criminal procedure), with respect to 
such collection and administration) shall apply to the collection and 
administration of qualified taxes as if such taxes were imposed by 
chapter 1, except to the extent that the application of such provisions 
(and sanctions) are modified by regulations issued under subchapter E 
(as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.6361-4). Any extension of time 
which is granted for the making of a payment, or for the filing of any 
return, which relates to any Federal tax imposed by subtitle A (or by 
subtitle C with respect to filing a return) shall constitute 
automatically an extension of the same amount of time for the making of 
the corresponding payment or for the filing of the corresponding return 
relating to any qualified tax.
    (b) Returns of qualified taxes. Every individual, estate, or trust 
which has liability for one or more qualified taxes for a taxable year--
    (1) Shall file a Federal income tax return at the time prescribed 
pursuant to section 6072(a) (whether or not such return is required by 
section 6012), and shall file therewith on the prescribed form a return 
under penalties of perjury for each tax which is--
    (i) A qualified resident tax imposed by a State of which the 
taxpayer was a resident, as defined in Sec. 301.6362-6, for any part of 
the taxable year;
    (ii) A qualified nonresident tax imposed by a State within which was 
located the source or sources from which the taxpayer derived, while not 
a resident of such State and while not exempt from liability for the tax 
by reason of a reciprocal agreement between such State and the State of 
which he is a resident, 25 percent or more of his aggregate wage and 
other business income, as defined in paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6362-5, 
for the taxable year; or
    (iii) A qualified resident or nonresident tax with respect to which 
any amount was currently collected from the taxpayer's income (including 
collection by withholding on wages or by payment of estimated income 
tax), as provided in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6362-6, for any part of 
the taxable year; and
    (2) Shall declare (in addition to the declaration required with 
respect to the return of the Federal income tax and in the place and 
manner prescribed by form or instructions thereto) under penalties of 
perjury that, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the taxpayer 
(or, in the case of an estate or trust, of the fiduciary who executes 
the Federal income tax return), he has no liability for any qualified 
tax for the taxable year other than any such liabilities returned with 
the Federal income tax return (pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph (b)). Such declaration shall constitute a return indicating no 
liability with respect to each qualified tax other than any such tax for 
which liability is so returned. A Federal income tax return form which 
is filed but which does not contain such declaration shall constitute a 
Federal income tax return only if the taxpayer in fact has no liability 
for any qualified State tax for the taxable year.
    (c) Credits--(1) Credit for tax of another State or political 
subdivision--(i) In general. A credit allowable under a qualified tax 
law against the tax imposed by such law for a taxpayer's tax liability 
to another State or a political subdivision of another State shall be 
allowed if the requirements of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph are 
met, and if the credit meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 301.6362-4. Such credit shall be allowed without regard to whether 
the tax imposed by the other State or subdivision thereof is a qualified 
tax, and without regard to whether such tax has been paid.
    (ii) Substantiation of tax liability for which a credit is allowed. 
If the liability which gives rise to a credit of the type described in 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is with respect to a qualified tax, 
then the fact of such liability shall be substantiated by filing the 
return on which such liability is reported. If such liability is not 
with respect to a qualified tax, then the Commissioner may require a 
taxpayer who claims entitlement to such a credit to complete a form to 
be submitted with his return of

[[Page 245]]

the qualified tax against which the credit is claimed. On such form the 
taxpayer shall identify each of the other States (the liabilities to 
which were not substantiated as provided in the first sentence of this 
subdivision) or political subdivisions to which the taxpayer reported a 
liability for a tax giving rise to the credit, furnish the name or 
description of each such tax, state the amount of the liability so 
reported with respect to each such tax and the beginning and ending 
dates of the taxable period for which such liability was reported, and 
provide such other information as is requested in the form or in the 
instructions thereto. In addition, the taxpayer shall agree on such form 
to notify the Commissioner in the event that the amount of any tax 
liability (or portion thereof) which is claimed as giving rise to a 
credit of the type described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is 
changed or adjusted, whether as a result of an amended return filed by 
the taxpayer, a determination by the jurisdiction imposing the tax, or 
in any other manner.
    (2) Credit or withheld qualified tax. An individual from whose wages 
an amount is withheld on account of a qualified tax shall receive a 
credit for such amount against his aggregate liability for all such 
qualified taxes and the Federal income tax for the taxable year, whether 
or not such tax has been paid over to the Federal Government by the 
employer. The credit shall operate in the manner provided by section 
31(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder with respect to Federal 
income tax withholding.
    (d) Collection of qualified taxes at source on wages--(1) In 
general. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph, every employer making payment of wages to an employee 
described in such subparagraph shall deduct and withhold upon such wages 
the amount prescribed with respect to the qualified tax designated in 
such subparagraph. The amounts prescribed for withholding with respect 
to each such qualified tax shall be published in Circular E (Employer's 
Tax Guide) or other appropriate Internal Revenue Service publications. 
See paragraph (f)(1) of Sec. 301.6362-7 with respect to civil and 
criminal penalties to which an employer shall be subject with respect to 
his responsibilities relating to qualified taxes.
    (2) Specific withholding requirements. An employer shall deduct and 
withhold upon an employee's wages the amount prescribed with respect to 
a qualified tax with respect to which such employee is subject to the 
current collection provisions pursuant to paragraph (f) of 
Sec. 301.6362-6, unless:
    (i) In the case of a qualified resident tax, the employee's services 
giving rise to the wages are performed in another State, and such other 
State or a political subdivision thereof imposes a nonresident tax on 
such employee with respect to which the withholding amount exceeds the 
prescribed withholding amount with respect to such qualified resident 
tax, and the State imposing such qualified resident tax grants a credit 
against it for such nonresident tax.
    (ii) In the case of a qualified nonresident tax, either:
    (A) Residents of the State in which the employee resides are exempt 
from liability for the qualified nonresident tax imposed by the State 
from sources within which his wage income is derived, by reason of an 
interstate compact or agreement to which the two States are parties, or
    (B) The State in which the employee resides imposes a qualified 
resident tax on such employee with respect to which the prescribed 
withholding amounts exceed the prescribed withholding amounts with 
respect to the qualified nonresident tax imposed by the State from 
sources within which his wage income is derived, and the State in which 
he resides grants a credit against its qualifed resident tax for such 
qualified nonresident tax.

If the nonresident tax described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph 
is a qualified nonresident tax imposed by a State, then the reference in 
such subdivision to the State in which the services are performed shall 
be construed as a reference to the State from sources within which the 
wage income is derived, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of 
Sec. 301.6362-5.
    (3) Forms, procedures, and returns relating to withholding with 
respect to qualified taxes--(i) Forms W-4 and W-4P.

[[Page 246]]

Forms W-4 (Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-4P 
(Annuitant's Request for Income Tax Withholding), shall include 
information as to the State in which the employee resides, and shall be 
used for purposes of withholding with respect to both Federal and 
qualified taxes. An employee shall show on his Form W-4 the State in 
which he resides for purposes of this paragraph, and shall file a new 
Form W-4 within 10 days after he changes his State of residence. An 
employee who fails to meet either of the requirements set forth in the 
preceding sentence, with the intent to evade the withholding tax imposed 
with respect to a qualifed tax, shall be subject to the penalty provided 
in section 7205 of the Code. An employer shall be responsible for 
determining the State within which are located the sources from which 
the employee's wage income is derived for purposes of this paragraph; 
and, if the employee does not file a Form W-4, the employer shall assume 
for such purposes that the employee resides in that State. When an 
employer and an employee enter into a voluntary withholding agreement 
pursuant to Sec. 31.3402(p)-1, the employer shall withhold the amount 
prescribed with respect to the qualified resident tax imposed by the 
State in which the employee resides, as indicated on Form W-4. 
Similarly, if an annuitant requests withholding with respect to his 
annuity payments pursuant to section 3402 (o)(1)(B) of the Code, the 
payer shall withhold the whole dollar amount specified by the annuitant 
with respect to a qualified resident tax, provided that the combined 
withholding with respect to Federal and qualified taxes on each annuity 
payment shall be a whole dollar amount not less than $5, and that the 
net amount of any annuity payment received by the payee shall not be 
reduced to less than $10.
    (ii) Forms W-2 and W-2P. Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) and W-2P 
(the corresponding form for annuities) shall show:
    (A) The total amount withheld with respect to the Federal income 
tax;
    (B) The total amount withheld with respect to qualified taxes;
    (C) The name of each State imposing a qualified tax in which the 
employee (or annuitant) resided during the taxable year, as shown on 
Form W-4 (or W-4P);
    (D) The name of each State imposing a qualified nonresident tax 
within which were located sources from which the employee's wage income 
was derived during a period of the taxable year in which he was not 
shown as a resident of such State on Form W-4, and the amount of the 
employee's wage income so derived; and
    (E) The name of each State or locality that imposes an income tax 
which is not a qualified tax and with respect to which the employer 
withheld on the employee's wage income for the taxable year, and the 
amount of wage income with respect to which the employer so withheld.
    (iii) Requirements relating to deposit and payment of withheld tax. 
Rules relating to the deposit and remittance of withheld Federal income 
and FICA taxes, including those prescribed in section 6302 of the Code 
and the regulations thereunder, shall apply also to amounts withheld 
with respect to qualified taxes. Thus, an employer's liability with 
respect to the deposit and payment of withheld taxes shall be for the 
combined amount of withholding with respect to Federal and qualified 
taxes. The Federal Tax Deposit form shall separately indicate:
    (A) The combined total amount of Federal income, FICA, and qualified 
taxes withheld;
    (B) The combined total amount of qualified taxes withheld; and
    (C) The total amount of qualified taxes withheld with respect to 
each electing State.

Data indicating the total amount of tax deposits processed by the 
Internal Revenue Service with respect to the qualified taxes of an 
electing State will be available to that State upon request on as 
frequent as a weekly basis. These data will be available no later than 
10 working days after the end of the calendar week in which the deposits 
were processed by the Service.
    (iv) Employment tax returns. Forms 941 (Employer's Quarterly Federal 
Tax Return), 941-E (Quarterly Return of Withheld Income Tax), 941-M 
(Employer's Monthly Federal Tax Return), 942 (Employer's Quarterly Tax 
Return for

[[Page 247]]

Household Employees), and 943 (Employer's Annual Tax Return for 
Agricultural Employees), shall indicate the total amount withheld with 
respect to each qualified tax, as directed by such forms or their 
instructions.
    (e) Criminal penalties. A criminal offense committed with respect to 
a qualified tax shall be treated as a separate offense from a similar 
offense committed with respect to the Federal tax. Thus, for example, if 
a taxpayer willfully attempts to evade both the Federal tax and a 
qualified tax by failing to report a portion of his income, he shall be 
considered as having committed two criminal offenses, each subject to a 
separate penalty under section 7201. See also Sec. 301.6362-7(f) with 
respect to criminal penalties.
    (f) Allocation of amounts collected with respect to tax and criminal 
fines--(1) In general. The aggregate amount that has been collected from 
a taxpayer (including amounts collected by withholding) in respect of 
liability for both one or more qualified taxes and the Federal income 
tax for a taxable year shall be allocated among the Federal Government 
and the States imposing qualified taxes for which the taxpayer is liable 
in the proportion which the taxpayer's liability for each such tax bears 
to his aggregate liability for such year to all of such taxing 
jurisdictions with respect to such taxes. A reallocation shall be made 
either when an amount is collected from the taxpayer or his employer or 
is credited or refunded to the taxpayer, subsequent to the making of the 
initial allocation, or when a determination is made by the Commissioner 
that an error was made with respect to a previous allocation. However, 
any such allocation or reallocation shall not affect the amount of a 
taxpayer's or employer's liability to either jurisdiction, or the amount 
of the assessment and collection which may be made with respect to a 
taxpayer or employer. Accordingly, such allocations and reallocations 
shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of the application of 
statutes of limitation or provisions relating to interest, additions to 
tax, penalties, and criminal sanctions. See example 4 in subparagraph 
(4) of this paragraph (e). In addition, any such allocation or 
reallocation shall not affect the amount of the deduction to which a 
taxpayer is entitled under section 164 for a year in which he made 
payment (including payments made by withholding) of an amount which was 
designated as being in respect of his liability for a qualified tax. 
However, to the extent that an amount which was paid by a taxpayer and 
designated as being in respect of his liability for a qualified tax is 
allocated or reallocated in such a manner as to apply it toward the 
taxpayer's liability for the Federal income tax, such allocation or 
reallocation shall be treated as a refund to the taxpayer of an amount 
paid in respect of a State income tax, and shall be included in the 
gross income of the taxpayer to the extent appropriate under section 111 
and the regulations thereunder in the year in which the allocation or 
reallocation is made. See section 451 and the regulations thereunder. 
Similarly, to the extent that an amount which was paid by a taxpayer and 
designated as being in respect of his Federal income tax liability is 
allocated or reallocated in such a manner as to apply it toward his 
liability for a qualified tax, such allocation or reallocation shall be 
treated as a payment made by the taxpayer in respect of a State income 
tax, and shall be deductible under section 164 in the year in which the 
allocation or reallocation is made. The Internal Revenue Service shall 
notify the taxpayer in writing of any allocation or reallocation of tax 
liabilities in a proportion other than that of the respective tax 
liabilities shown on the taxpayer's returns.
    (2) Amounts of collections and liabilities. For purposes of this 
paragraph the aggregate amount that has been collected from a taxpayer 
or his employer in respect of tax liability shall include the amounts of 
interest provided in chapter 67, and additions to tax and assessable 
penalties provided in chapter 68, which are collected with respect to 
such tax; but shall not include criminal fines provided in chapter 75, 
or in title 18 of the United States Code, which are collected with 
respect to offenses relating to such tax. (See subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph (e) with respect to the treatment of such criminal fines.)

[[Page 248]]

However, for purposes of this paragraph, the amount of the taxpayer's 
liability for each tax shall exclude his liability for such interest 
additions to tax, and assessable penalties with respect to such tax, and 
his liability for criminal fines imposed with respect to offenses 
relating to such tax. For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of the 
taxpayer's liability for each tax shall be computed by taking credits 
into account, except that there shall be no reduction for any amounts 
paid on account of such liability, whether by means of withholding, 
estimated tax payment, or otherwise.
    (3) Special rules relating to criminal fines. (i) Except as 
otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, when a 
criminal charge is brought against a taxpayer with respect to a taxable 
year pursuant to chapter 75, or to title 18 of the United States Code, 
or to a corresponding provision of a qualified tax law, alleging that an 
offense was committed against the United States with respect to the 
Federal income tax or against a State with respect to a qualified tax, 
and an amount of money is collected by the Federal Government as a fine 
as a result of such charge, then the Federal Government shall remit an 
amount to each State, if any, which is an affected jurisdiction. The 
amount remitted to each such State shall bear the same proportion to the 
total amount collected as a fine as the taxpayer's liability with 
respect to the qualified taxes of that State bears to the aggregate of 
the taxpayer's income tax liabilities to all affected jurisdictions for 
the taxable year, as determined under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this 
paragraph (e). For purposes of this subparagraph, an affected 
jurisdiction is (A) a jurisdiction with respect to the tax of which a 
criminal charge described in the preceding sentence was brought for the 
taxable year, or (B) a jurisdiction with respect to the Federal income 
tax or the qualified tax of which the acts or omissions alleged in such 
a criminal charge would constitute the basis for the bringing of a 
criminal charge for the same taxable year. However, in no case shall the 
amount received by an affected State, or the amount of the excess of the 
amount received by the Federal Government over the amount of its 
remissions to States, with respect to a fine exceed the maximum fine 
prescribed by statute for the offense against that jurisdiction with 
respect to which a criminal charge was brought, or with respect to which 
the bringing of a criminal charge could have been supported on the basis 
of the acts or omissions alleged in a criminal charge brought. For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the amount collected as a fine as a 
result of a criminal charge shall include amounts paid in settlement of 
an actual or potential liability for a fine, amounts paid pursuant to a 
conviction and amounts paid pursuant to a plea of guilty or nolo 
contendere.
    (ii) If a criminal charge described in the first sentence of 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is actually brought with respect to 
the income tax of every affected jurisdiction with respect to the 
taxable year, and if a Court adjudicates on the merits the taxpayer's 
liability for a fine to each such jurisdiction, and includes in its 
decree a direction of the amount, if any, to be paid as a fine to each 
such jurisdiction, then that decree shall govern the allocation of the 
amount of money collected by the Federal Government as a fine with 
respect to the taxable year.
    (4) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. The total combined amount of State X qualified tax and 
Federal income tax collected from A, a resident of State X, for the 
taxable year is $5,100. The amounts of A's liabilities for such taxes 
for that year are $800 to State X and $4,000 to the Federal Government. 
Since A's tax liability to State X is one-sixth of the combined tax 
liability ($4,800), one-sixth ($50) of the amount to be refunded to A 
($300) is chargeable against State X's account, and five-sixths ($250) 
is chargeable against the Federal Government's account.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the 
total amount collected from A is $4,500. Since A's liabilities for the 
State X tax and the Federal tax are one-sixth and five-sixths, 
respectively, of the combined tax liability, the Federal Government 
shall pay over to State X one-sixth ($750) of the amount actually 
collected from A, and the Federal Government shall retain five-sixths 
($3,750).
    Example 3. The total amount of State X qualified tax, State Y 
qualified tax, and Federal income tax collected from B, a resident

[[Page 249]]

of State X who is employed in State Y, for the taxable year is $5,500. 
The amounts of B's liabilities for such taxes for that year are: $250 
for the State X tax (after allowance of a credit for State Y's qualified 
tax), $750 for the State Y tax, and $4,000 for the Federal tax. Since 
B's liability for the State X tax ($250) is 5 percent of the combined 
tax liability ($5,000), his liability for the State Y tax ($750) is 15 
percent of such combined liability, and his liability for the Federal 
tax ($4,000) is 80 percent of such combined liability, the total amount 
to be refunded to B ($500) shall be chargeable in the following manner: 
5 percent ($25) against State X's account, 15 percent ($75) against 
State Y's account, and 80 percent ($400) against the Federal 
Government's account.
    Example 4. C is liable for $2,000 in Federal income tax and $500 in 
State X qualified tax (a resident tax) for the taxable year. However, on 
his Federal income tax return for such year, C erroneously described 
himself as a resident of State Y (which does not have a qualified tax), 
and he filed with such return his declaration to the effect that he had 
no qualified tax liability for the year. Accordingly, C paid only $2,000 
for his Federal tax liability, and such amount was retained in the 
account of the Federal Government. Subsequently, C's error is 
discovered. The amount collected by the Federal Government from C for 
such year must be allocated between the Federal Government and State X 
in proportion to C's tax liability to both. Accordingly, the Federal 
Government must pay over to State X the amount of $400 (which is \1/5\ 
($500/$2,500) of the $2,000 collected). If the Federal Government 
collects from C the additional $500 owed, it will retain $400 of such 
amount and pay the remaining $100 to State X. Similarly, if the Federal 
Government collects from C any interest, or any additions to tax or 
assessable penalties under chapter 68, \4/5\ of the amount of such 
collections shall be retained by the Federal Government and \1/5\ of 
such amount shall be paid over to State X. However, notwithstanding the 
allocation of the funds between the taxing jurisdictions, C's liability 
for the $500 retains its character as a liability for State X tax. 
Therefore, any interest, additions to tax, or assessable penalities 
imposed with respect to the State X tax shall be imposed with respect to 
C's full $500 liability for such tax, notwithstanding the fact that 
amounts collected with respect to such items shall be allocated \4/5\ to 
the Federal Government.
    Example 5. A criminal charge is brought against D pursuant to 
chapter 75, alleging that he willfully evaded the payment of Federal 
income tax by failing to report interest income derived from obligations 
of the United States. D enters a plea of non contendere to the charge 
and pays $2,500 as a fine to the Federal Government. The act alleged in 
the criminal charge would not support the bringing of a criminal charge 
under a State law corresponding to chapter 75, or to title 18 of the 
United States Code, with respect to the qualified tax of any State; 
accordingly, the United States is the only affected jurisdiction, and no 
remittances shall be made to any State with respect to the amount 
collected by the Federal Government as a fine.
    Example 6. A criminal charge is brought against E pursuant to 
chapter 75, alleging that he willfully attempted to evade the assessment 
of liability for both Federal income tax and the qualified tax of State 
X by filing false and fraudulent income tax returns. E's case is settled 
upon the condition that he pay a fine in the amount of $5,000. As 
determined pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, E's 
liabilities for the taxable year are in the amounts of $7,200 to the 
Federal Government and $800 to State X. Accordingly, after the Federal 
Government collects the fine, $500 ($5,000+$800 x $8,000) is remitted to 
State X.
    Example 7. Assume the same facts as in example 6, except that E is 
tried and convicted on both charges, and pursuant to court decree he 
pays to the United States a fine of $6,000 with respect to each charge, 
or a total of $12,000. Because a criminal charge was brought with 
respect to each affected jurisdiction, and the allocation of the total 
amount paid as a fine was specifically imposed by a court decree, the 
direction of the Court shall govern the allocation. Accordingly, after 
the Federal Government collects the fines it pays over $6,000 to the 
account of State X.

Sec. 301.6361-2  Judicial and administrative proceedings; Federal representation of State interests.

    (a) Civil proceedings--(1) General rule. Any person shall have the 
same right to bring or contest a civil action, and to obtain a review 
thereof, with respect to a qualified tax (including the current 
collection thereof) in the same court or courts which would be available 
to him, and pursuant to the same requirements and procedures to which he 
would be subject, under chapter 76 (relating to judicial proceedings), 
and under title 28 of the United States Code (relating to the judiciary 
and judicial procedure), if the tax were imposed by section 1 or chapter 
24 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this section, the term 
``person'' includes the

[[Page 250]]

Federal Government. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph (a), to the extent that the preceding sentence provides 
judicial procedures (including review procedures) with respect to any 
matter, such procedures shall replace civil judicial procedures under 
State law.
    (2) Exception. The right or power of the courts of any State to pass 
on matters involving the constitution of such State is unaffected by any 
provision of this paragraph; however, the jurisdiction of a State court 
in such matters shall not extend beyond the issue of constitutionality. 
Thus, if in a case involving the validity of a qualified tax statute 
under the State constitution, the State court holds such statute 
constitutional, such court shall not proceed to decide the amount of the 
tax liability.
    (b) Criminal proceedings. Only the Federal Government shall have the 
right to bring a criminal action with respect to a qualified tax 
(including the current collection thereof). Such an action shall be 
brought in the same court or courts which would be available to the 
Federal Government, and pursuant to the same requirements and procedures 
to which the Federal Government would be subject, if the tax were 
imposed by section 1 or chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (c) Administrative proceedings. Any person shall have the same 
rights in administrative proceedings of the Internal Revenue Service 
with respect to a qualified tax (including the current collection 
thereof) which would be available to him, and shall be subject to the 
same administrative requirements and procedures to which he would be 
subject, if the tax were imposed by section 1 or chapter 24 of the 
Internal Revenue Code.
    (d) United States representation of State interests--(1) General 
rule. Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph 
(d), the Federal Government shall appear on behalf of any State the 
qualified tax of which it collects (or did collect for the year in 
issue), and shall represent such State's interests in any administrative 
or judicial proceeding, either civil or criminal in nature, which 
relates to the administration and collection of such qualified tax, in 
the same manner as it represents the interests of the United States in 
corresponding proceedings involving Federal income tax matters.
    (2) Exceptions. The Federal Government shall not so represent a 
State's interests either--
    (i) In proceedings in a State court involving the constitution of 
such State, to the extent of such constitutional issue, or
    (ii) In proceedings in any court involving the relationship between 
the United States and the State, to the extent of the issue pertaining 
to such relationship, if either:
    (A) The proceeding is one which is initiated by the United States 
against the State, or by the State against the United States, and no 
individual (except in his official capacity as a governmental official) 
is an original party to the proceeding, or
    (B) The proceeding is not one described in (A), but the State elects 
to represent its own interests to the extent permissible under this 
subdivision.
    (3) Finality of Federal administrative determinations. State and 
local government officials and employees may not review Federal 
administrative determinations concerning tax liabilities of, refunds 
owed to, or criminal prosecutions of, individuals with respect to 
qualified taxes. See, however, Sec. 301.6363-3 relating to State 
administration of a qualified tax with respect to transition years. If 
requested by an electing State, the Commissioner or his delegate may, 
under terms and conditions set forth in an agreement with such State, 
permit such State to carry on operations supplementary to the Federal 
administration of the State's qualified tax (including supplemental 
audits or examinations of tax returns by State audit personnel), but all 
administrative determinations shall be made by the Federal Government 
without review by the State. An agreement which permits supplemental 
audits or examinations of tax returns by State audit personnel shall 
provide that the audits and examinations shall be conducted under the 
supervision and control of the Commissioner or his delegate, who shall 
have the authority to determine which returns shall be audited and when 
the audits shall occur.

[[Page 251]]

Also, such agreements shall provide that the results of any such 
supplemental audit shall be referred to the Commissioner or his delegate 
for final administrative determination. The Commissioner or his delegate 
shall, to the extent permitted by law, allow an electing State 
reasonable access to tax returns and other appropriate records and 
information relating to its qualified tax for the purpose of conducting 
any such supplemental operations. In addition, the Secretary or his 
delegate shall permit an electing State to inspect the workpapers which 
are compiled in the course of verification by the Treasury Department of 
the correctness of the accounting by which the amounts of the actual net 
collections attributable to the electing State's qualified taxes are 
determined.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6361-3  Transfers to States.

    (a) Periodic transfers. In general, amounts collected by the Federal 
Government which are allocable to qualified taxes (including criminal 
fines which are required to be paid to a State, as determined under 
paragraph (f)(3) of Sec. 301.6361-1) shall be promptly transferred to 
each State imposing such a tax. Transfers of such amounts, based on 
percentages of estimated Federal collections, shall be made not less 
frequently than every third business day unless the State agrees to 
accept transfers at less frequent intervals.
    (b) Determination of amounts of transfers. The amounts allocable to 
the qualified taxes of each State for purposes of periodic transfer 
shall be determined as a percentage of the estimated aggregate net 
individual income tax collections made by the Federal Government. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the ``aggregate net individual income tax 
collections'' shall include amounts collected on account of the Federal 
individual income tax and all qualified taxes by all means (including 
withholding, tax returns, and declarations of estimated tax), and shall 
be reduced to the extent of any liability to taxpayers for credits or 
refunds by reason of overpayments of such taxes. The percentage of the 
estimated amount of such collections which is allocated to each State 
shall be based on an estimate which is to be made by the Office of Tax 
Analysis prior to the beginning of each calendar year as to what portion 
of the estimated aggregate net individual income tax collections for the 
forthcoming year will be attributable to the qualified taxes of that 
State. Each State will be notified prior to the beginning of each 
calendar year of the amount which it is estimated that the State will 
receive by application of that percentage for the year. However, the 
Office of Tax Analysis shall, from time to time throughout the calendar 
year, revise the percentage estimates when such a revision is, in the 
opinion of that office necessary to conform such estimates to the actual 
receipts. When such a revision is made, the payments to the State will 
be adjusted accordingly.
    (c) Adjustment of difference between actual collections and periodic 
transfers. At least once annually the Secretary or his delegate shall 
determine the difference between the aggregate amount of the actual net 
collections made (taking into account credits, refunds, and amounts 
received by withholding with respect to which a tax return is not filed) 
which is attributable to each State's qualified taxes during the 
preceding year and the aggregate amount actually transferred to such 
State based on estimates during such year. The amount of such 
difference, as so determined, shall be a charge against, or an addition 
to, the amounts otherwise determined to be payable to the State.
    (d) Recipient of transferred funds. All funds transferred pursuant 
to section 6361(c) and paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
transferred by the Federal Government to the State official designated 
by the Governor to receive such funds in the State agreement pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(5) of Sec. 301.6363-1, unless the Governor notifies the 
Secretary or his delegate in writing of the designation of a different 
State official to receive the funds.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6362-2  Qualified resident tax based on taxable income.

    (a) In general. A tax meets the requirements of section 6362(b) and 
this section only if it is imposed on the amount of the taxable income, 
as defined in section 63, of the individual, estate, or trust, 
adjusted--
    (1) By subtracting an amount equal to the amount of the taxpayer's 
interest on obligations of the United States which was included in his 
gross income for the taxable year;
    (2) By adding an amount equal to the amount of the taxpayer's net 
State income tax deduction, as defined in paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 301.6362-4, for the taxable year;
    (3) By adding an amount equal to the amount of the taxpayer's net 
tax-exempt income, as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6362-4, for 
the taxable year; and
    (4) If a credit is allowed against the tax in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section for sales tax imposed by the State or a 
political subdivision thereof, by adding an amount equal to the amount 
of the taxpayer's deduction

[[Page 253]]

under section 164(a)(4) for such sales tax.

The tax may provide for either a single rate or multiple rates which 
vary with the amount of taxable income, as adjusted.
    (b) Permitted adjustments. A tax which otherwise meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be deemed to 
fail to meet such requirements solely because it provides for one or 
more of the following adjustments:
    (1) A credit meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 301.6362-4 is allowed against the tax for the taxpayer's income tax 
liability to another State or a political subdivision thereof.
    (2) A tax is imposed on the amount taxed under section 56 (relating 
to the minimum tax for tax preferences).
    (3) A credit is allowed against the tax for all or a portion of any 
general sales tax imposed by the State or a political subdivision 
thereof with respect to sales either to the taxpayer or to one or more 
of his dependents.
    (c) Method of making mandatory adjustments. The mandatory 
adjustments provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made 
directly to taxable income. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of 
Sec. 301.6362-4, no account shall be taken of any reduction or increase 
in the Federal adjusted gross income which would result from the 
exclusion from, or inclusion in, gross income of the items which are the 
subject of the adjustments. Thus, for example, when for purposes of the 
calculation the taxpayer's Federal taxable income is adjusted to reflect 
the exclusion from gross income of interest on obligations of the United 
States, no change shall be made in the amount of the taxpayer's 
deduction for medical expenses, or in the amount of his charitable 
contribution base, even though such amounts would ordinarily depend upon 
the amount of adjusted gross income.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6362-3  Qualified resident tax which is a percentage of Federal tax.

    (a) In general. A tax meets the requirements of section 6362(c) and 
this section only if:
    (1) The tax is imposed as a single specified percentage of the 
excess of the taxes imposed by chapter 1 over the sum of the credits 
allowable under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 (other than the 
credits allowable under sections 31 and 39), and
    (2) The amount of the tax is decreased by the amount of the decrease 
in such liability which would result from excluding from the taxpayer's 
gross income an amount equal to the amount of interest on obligations of 
the United States which was included in his gross income for the taxable 
year.
    (b) Permitted adjustments. A tax which otherwise meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be deemed to 
fail to meet such requirements solely because it provides for one or 
more of the following three adjustments:
    (1) The amount of a taxpayer's liability for tax is increased by the 
amount of the increase in such liability which would result from 
including in such taxpayer's gross income all of the following:
    (i) An amount equal to the amount of his net State income tax 
deduction, as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6362-4, for the 
taxable year,
    (ii) An amount equal to the amount of his net tax-exempt income, as 
defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6362-4, for the taxable year, and
    (iii) If a credit is allowed against the tax under paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section for sales tax imposed by the State or a political 
subdivision thereof, an amount equal to the amount of his deduction 
under section 164(a)(4) for such sales tax.
    (2) A credit meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 301.6362-4 is allowed against the tax for the income tax of another 
State or a political subdivision thereof.

[[Page 254]]

    (3) A credit is allowed against the tax for all or a portion of any 
general sales tax imposed by the State or a political subdivision 
thereof with respect to sales either to the taxpayer or to one or more 
of his dependents.
    (c) Method of making adjustments. Except as specifically provided in 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1) of this section and in paragraph (c)(2) of 
Sec. 301.6362-4, no account shall be taken of any reduction or increase 
in the Federal adjusted gross income which would result from the 
exclusion from, or inclusion in, gross income of the items which are the 
subject of the adjustments provided in those paragraphs. Thus, for 
example, when for purposes of the calculation the taxpayer's Federal 
income tax liability is adjusted to reflect the exclusion from gross 
income of interest on obligations of the United States, no change shall 
be made in the amount of the taxpayer's deduction for medical expenses, 
or in the amount of his charitable contribution base, even though such 
amounts would ordinarily depend upon the amount of adjusted gross 
income. Also, when calculating the adjusted Federal tax liability to 
which the rate of the State tax is to be applied, no adjustment shall be 
made in the amount of any credit against Federal tax to which a taxpayer 
is entitled.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6362-4  Rules for adjustments relating to qualified resident taxes.

    (a) Net State income tax deduction. For purposes of section 6362 
(b)(1)(B) and (c)(3)(B), and Secs. 301.6362-2 and 301.6362-3, the ``net 
State income tax deduction'' shall be the excess (if any) of (1) the 
amount deducted from income under section 164(a)(3) as taxes paid to a 
State or to a political subdivision thereof, over (2) the amounts 
included in income as recoveries of prior income taxes which were paid 
to a State or to a political subdivision thereof and which had been 
deducted under section 164(a)(3).
    (b) Net tax-exempt income. For purposes of section 6362 (b)(1)(C) 
and (c)(3)(A) and Secs. 301.6362-2 and 301.6362-3, the ``net tax-exempt 
income'' shall be the excess (if any) of:
    (1) The sum of (i) the interest on obligations described in section 
103 (a)(1) other than obligations of the State imposing the tax and the 
political subdivisions thereof, and (ii) the interest on obligations 
described in such section of such State and the political subdivisions 
thereof which under the law of the State is subject to the tax; over
    (2) The sum of (i) the amount of deductions allocable to the 
interest described in subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this paragraph 
(b), which is disallowed pursuant to section 265 and the regulations 
thereunder, and (ii) the amount of the adjustment to basis allocable to 
such obligations which is required to be made for the taxable year under 
section 1016(a) (5) or (6).

For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (b), a State may, 
at its option, subject to the tax the interest from all, none, or some 
of its section 103(a)(1) obligations and those of its political 
subdivisions. For example, a State may subject to tax all of such 
obligations other than those which it or its political subdivisions 
issued prior to a specified date, which may be the date that subchapter 
E became applicable to the State.
    (c) Credits for taxes of other jurisdictions--(1) In general. A 
State tax law that provides for a credit, pursuant to section 6362(b)(2) 
(B) or (C) or section 6362(c)(4), and paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 301.6362-
2 or paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 301.6362-3, for income tax of another 
State or a political subdivision thereof shall provide that, in the case 
of each taxpayer, the amount of the credit shall equal the amount of his 
liability with respect to such other jurisdiction's tax for the taxable 
year which runs concurrently with, or which ends in, the taxable year 
used by the taxpayer for purposes of the State tax which provides for 
the credit. Such a credit may be allowed with respect to every income 
tax (whether or not qualified) imposed on the taxpayer by another State 
or a political subdivision thereof, or only with respect to certain of 
such taxes. However, for purposes of this paragraph, the amount which is 
treated as being the amount of the taxpayer's liability with respect to 
any

[[Page 255]]

such tax imposed by another jurisdiction shall not exceed the amount of 
liability for such tax which is both--
    (A) Reported to the taxing authorities responsible for collecting 
such other jurisdiction's tax, and
    (B) Substantiated pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of Sec. 301.6361-1.
    (2) Limitation. The amount of any credit allowed for the taxable 
year pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the product of the 
amount of the resident tax against which the credit is allowed, as 
computed without subtracting any such credit, multiplied by a fraction 
the numerator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by both 
the State imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed 
and the other jurisdiction whose tax is being credited, and the 
denominator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by the State 
imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, ``income subject to tax'' means the 
amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income which is taken into 
account for purposes of computing tax liability; in the case of a 
qualified resident tax, an appropriate modification shall be made to 
take into account any adjustments which are made pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) and (3) of Sec. 301.6362-2, or pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) or 
(b)(1)(ii) of Sec. 301.6362-3.
    (3) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) A, a calendar-year, cash-basis taxpayer, is a 
resident of State X throughout the taxable year. For such year, his 
adjusted gross income for Federal income tax purposes consists of 
$24,000, consisting of $3,000 derived from employment in State X, $5,000 
derived from employment in State Y. $15,000 derived from employment in 
State Z, and $1,000 in interest income from United States savings bonds. 
In addition, he received net tax-exempt income in the amount of $2,000. 
For the taxable year, he incurs liabilities of $200 for the State Y 
nonresident income tax, and $1,400 for the State Z nonresident income 
tax. State X, which has in effect a State agreement for the taxable 
year, imposes a resident tax against which credits are allowed for the 
nonresident taxes imposed by States Y and Z. Without taking any such 
credits into account, however, the amount of A's liability for such 
resident tax would be $1,500. A properly reports his nonresident income 
tax liabilities to States Y and Z at the same time that he files his 
return with respect to the State X tax, and he substantiates on such 
return his liabilities to States Y and Z.
    (ii) The amount of A's income subject to tax in State X is $25,000 
(his adjusted gross income of $24,000, minus the United States savings 
bond income of $1,000, plus the net tax-exempt income of $2,000). The 
amount of the credit allowable against the State X resident tax for the 
amount of A's liability with respect to the State Y nonresident tax is 
calculated as follows: The maximum amount of credit is the actual amount 
of his liability to Y, or $200. Under subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph, the amount of the credit is limited to $300 ($1,500  x  
$5,000/$25,000). Thus, such limit has no effect, and the full $200 is 
allowable as a credit against A's liability for the resident tax of 
State X. The amount of the credit allowable against the State X resident 
tax for the amount of A's liability with respect to the State Z 
nonresident tax is calculated as follows: The maximum amount of the 
credit is the actual amount of his liability to Z, or $1,400. Under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of the credit is limited 
to $900 (1,500  x  $15,000/$25,000). Thus, such limit has the effect of 
reducing to $900 the amount of the credit allowable for tax of State Z 
against A's liability for the resident tax of State X.
    Example 2. (i) B, a calendar-year, cash-basis taxpayer, is a 
resident of State X employed in State Y through March 14, 1977. On March 
15, 1977, B becomes a resident of State Z and remains a resident of such 
State through the remainder of 1977. For 1977, the amount of B's 
adjusted gross income for Federal income tax purposes is $20,000, 
consisting of $6,000 derived from employment in State Y which B held 
during the period of his residence in State X, $12,000 derived from 
employment in State Z which B held during the period of his residence in 
State Z, and $2,000 in interest income from various bank accounts. 
During 1977, B has no interest income from United States obligations, 
and no tax-exempt income. For 1977, B incurs a liability of $200 to 
State Y on account of its nonresident income tax imposed with respect to 
his $6,000 of income derived from sources within that State. State Z, 
which has in effect a State agreement for 1977, imposes a resident 
income tax on B which, if B had been a resident of State Z for all 1977, 
would amount to $1,200 prior to the allowance of any credits under this 
paragraph. However, by reason of paragraph (e)(1) of Sec. 301.6362-6, 
B's liability for the resident tax of State Z, before taking into 
account credits allowed under this paragraph, is reduced to $960 ($1,200 
 x  \292/365\, or \4/5\). Furthermore, State Z allows a credit for the 
nonresident tax imposed by State Y.

[[Page 256]]

    (ii) The amount of the credit allowable against the State Z resident 
tax for the amount of B's liability with respect to the State Y 
nonresident tax is calculated as follows: The maximum amount of the 
credit is the amount of his actual liability to State Y, or $200. Under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of the credit is limited 
to $288 ($960  x  $6,000/$20,000). Thus, such limit has no effect, and 
the full $200 is allowable as a credit for tax of State Y against B's 
liability for the resident tax of State Z.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6362-5  Qualified nonresident tax.

    (a) In general. A tax meets the requirements of section 6362(d) and 
this section only if:
    (1) The tax is imposed by a State which simultaneously imposes a 
resident tax meeting the requirements of section 6362(b) and 
Sec. 301.6362-2 or of section 6362(c) and Sec. 301.6362-3;
    (2) The tax is required to be computed in accordance with either the 
method prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section or another method of 
which the Secretary or his delegate approves upon submission by the 
State of the laws pertaining to the tax;
    (3) The tax is imposed only on the wage and other business income 
derived from sources within such State (as defined in paragraph (d) of 
this section), of all individuals each of whom derives 25 percent or 
more of his aggregate wage and other business income for the taxable 
year from sources within such State while he is neither (i) a resident 
of such State within the meaning of section 6362(e) and Sec. 301.6362-6, 
nor (ii) exempt from liability for the tax by reason of a reciprocal 
agreement between such State and the State of which he is a resident 
within the meaning of those provisions;
    (4) The amount of the tax imposed with respect to any individual 
does not exceed the amount of tax for which such individual would be 
liable under the qualified resident tax imposed by such State if he were 
a resident of the State for the period during which he earned wage or 
other business income from sources within the State, and if his taxable 
income for such period were an amount equal to the sum of the zero 
bracket amount (within the meaning of section 63(d) and determined as if 
he had been a resident of the State for such period) and the excess of:
    (i) The amount of his wage and other business income derived from 
sources within the State, over
    (ii) That portion of the sum of the zero bracket amount and the 
nonbusiness deductions (i.e., all deductions from adjusted gross income 
allowable in computing taxable income) taken into account for purposes 
of the State's qualified resident tax which bears the same ratio to such 
sum as the amount described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph 
bears to his total adjusted gross income for the year; and
    (5) For purposes of the tax, wage or other business income is 
considered as being the income of the individual whose income it is for 
purposes of section 61.
    (b) Approved method of computing liability for qualified nonresident 
tax. A tax satisfies the requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
if the amount of the tax is computed either as a percentage of the 
excess of the amount described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section 
over the amount described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, or by 
application of progressive rates to such excess.
    (c) Definition of wage and other business income. For purposes of 
section 6362(d) and this section, the term ``wage and other business 
income'' means the following types of income:
    (1) Wages, as defined in section 3401(a) and the regulations 
thereunder, but for these purposes:
    (i) The amount of wages shall exclude amounts which are treated as 
wages under section 3402 (o) or (p) (relating to supplemental 
unemployment compensation benefits, annuity payments, and voluntary 
withholding agreements), and amounts which are treated as disability 
payments to the extent that they are excluded from gross income for 
Federal income tax purposes, pursuant to section 105(d), and
    (ii) The amount of wages shall be reduced by those expenses which 
are directly related to the earning of such wages and with respect to 
which deductions are properly claimed from gross income in computing 
adjusted gross income;

[[Page 257]]

    (2) Net earnings from self-employment, as defined in section 
1402(a); and
    (3) The distributive share of income of any trade or business 
carried on by a trust, estate, or electing small business corporation 
(as defined in section 1371(a) and the regulations thereunder), to the 
extent that such share:
    (i) Is includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the 
taxable year, and
    (ii) Would constitute net earnings from self-employment if the trade 
or business were carried on by a partnership.

For purposes of this subparagraph, ``distributive share'' includes the 
income of a trust or estate which is taxable to the taxpayer as a 
beneficiary under applicable Federal income tax rules, and the 
undistributed taxable income of an electing small business corporation 
which is taxable to the taxpayer as a shareholder under section 1373.
    (d) Income derived from sources within a State--(1) Income 
attributable primarily to services. Except as otherwise provided by 
Federal statute (see paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of Sec. 301.6362-7), 
wage income and other business income (net earnings from self-employment 
or distributive shares) which is attributable more to services performed 
by the taxpayer than to a capital investment of the taxpayer shall be 
considered to have been derived from sources within a State only if the 
services of the taxpayer which give rise to the income are performed in 
such State. If for a taxable year only a portion of the taxpayer's 
services giving rise to the income from one employment, trade, or 
business is performed within a State, then it shall be presumed that the 
amount of income from such employment, trade, or business which is 
derived from sources within that State equals that portion of the total 
income derived from such employment, trade, or business for the year 
which the amount of time spent by the taxpayer for such year performing 
services with respect to that employment, trade, or business in that 
State bears to the aggregate amount of time spent by the taxpayer for 
such year performing all of such services. However, the presumption 
stated in the preceding sentence may be rebutted in the event that the 
taxpayer proves, by use of detailed records, that the correct allocation 
of his income is otherwise.
    (2) Income attributable primarily to investment. Except as otherwise 
provided by Federal statute (see paragraph (j) of Sec. 301.6362-7), 
business income (net earnings from self-employment or distributive 
shares) which is attributable more to a capital investment of the 
taxpayer than to services performed by the taxpayer shall be considered 
to have been derived from sources within the State, if any, in which the 
significant activities of the trade or business are conducted. If for 
the taxable year only a portion of the significant activities conducted 
with respect to one trade or business is conducted within a certain 
State, then the portion of the taxpayer's total income for the year from 
such trade or business which is considered to be derived from sources 
within that State shall be computed as follows:
    (i) Allocation by records. The portion of the taxpayer's total 
income from the trade or business which is considered to be derived from 
sources within the State shall be the portion which is allocable to such 
sources according to the records of the taxpayer or of the partnership, 
trust, estate, or electing small business corporation from which his 
income is derived, provided that the taxpayer establishes to the 
satisfaction of the district director, when requested to do so, that 
those records fairly and equitably reflect the income which is allocable 
to sources within the State. An allocation made pursuant to this 
subdivision shall be based on the location of the significant activities 
of the trade or business, and not on the location at which the 
taxpayer's personal services are performed.
    (ii) Allocation by formula. If the taxpayer (or the trade or 
business) does not keep records meeting the requirements of subdivision 
(i) of this subparagraph, or if the taxpayer fails to meet the burden of 
proof set forth therein, then the amount of the taxpayer's income from 
the trade or business which is considered to be derived from sources 
within the State shall be determined by multiplying the total of his 
income (as defined in paragraphs (c) (2)

[[Page 258]]

and (3) of this section) from the trade or business for the taxable year 
by the percentage which is the average of these three percentages:
    (A) Property percentage. The percentage computed by dividing the 
average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of 
real and tangible personal property connected with the taxpayer's trade 
or business and located within the State, by the average of the value, 
at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of all such property 
located both within and without the State. For this purpose, real 
property shall include real property rented to the taxpayer in 
connection with the trade or business, or rented to the trade or 
business.
    (B) Payroll percentage. The percentage computed by dividing the 
total wages, salaries, and other compensation for personal services 
which is paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in 
connection with the taxpayer's trade or business, and which would be 
treated as derived by such employees from sources within the State 
pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (d), by the total of all 
such wages, salaries, and other compensation for personal services which 
is so paid or incurred without regard to whether such payments would be 
treated as derived by the employees from sources within the State. For 
purposes of this subdivision (ii), no amount paid as deferred 
compensation pursuant to a retirement plan to a former employee shall be 
taken into consideration.
    (C) Gross income percentage. The percentage computed by dividing the 
gross sales or charges for services performed by or through an agency 
located within the State by the total of all gross sales or charges for 
services performed both within and without the State. The sales or 
charges to be allocated to the State shall include all sales which are 
negotiated, and charges which are for services performed, by an 
employee, agent, agency, or independent contractor chiefly situated at, 
or working principally out of an office located within, the State.
    (3) Income attributable to real estate investment. Notwithstanding 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), income and deductions from the 
rental of real property, and gain and loss from the sale, exchange, or 
other disposition of real property, shall not be subject to allocation 
under subparagraph (2), but shall be considered as entirely derived from 
sources located within the State in which such property is located.
    (4) Treatment of losses. A loss attributable to the taxpayer's 
employment, or to his conduct of, participation in, or investment in a 
trade or business, shall be allocated in the same manner as the income 
attributable to such employment or trade or business would be allocated 
pursuant to this paragraph.
    (5) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, an employee who earns $10,000 in wage income 
attributable to services, and who has no other wage or other business 
income, spends 60 percent of his working time performing services for 
his employer in State X, 30 percent in State Y, and 10 percent in State 
Z. In the absence of the requisite proof to the contrary, A's wage 
income is considered to have been derived 60 percent from sources 
located within State X, 30 percent within State Y, and 10 percent within 
State Z. Assuming that A is a nonresident with respect to all three 
States, and that they all impose qualified nonresident taxes, then the 
qualified nonresident tax of State X is imposed on $6,000, the qualified 
nonresident tax of State Y is imposed on $3,000, and the qualified 
nonresident tax of State Z is not imposed on any of the income because A 
did not derive at least 25 percent of his wage and other business income 
from sources located within State Z.
    Example 2. B, who earns no wage income but who has a total of 
$10,000 of other business income for the taxable year, all of which is 
net income from self-employment attributable primarily to services, 
spends 45 percent of his working time performing services in State X, 30 
percent in State Y, and 25 percent in State Z. However, the rates that B 
is able to charge for his services and the business expenses which he 
incurs vary in the different States, and he is able to prove by detailed 
records that his net income from self-employment was in fact derived 50 
percent from sources located within State X, 35 percent from sources 
located within State Y, and 15 percent from sources located within State 
Z. Assuming that B is a nonresident with respect to all three States, 
and that they all impose qualified nonresident taxes, then the qualified 
nonresident tax of State X is imposed on $5,000, the qualified 
nonresident tax of State Y is imposed on $3,500, and the qualified 
nonresident tax of State Z is not imposed on any of the income because

[[Page 259]]

B did not derive at least 25 percent of his wage and other business 
income from sources located within State Z.
    Example 3. C is a partner in a profitable business concern, in which 
he has a substantial capital investment. His net earnings from self-
employment attributable to his partnership interest are $75,000 for the 
taxable year. The fair market value of the services which C performs for 
the partnership during the taxable year is $30,000. C's income is 
therefore attributable primarily to his capital investment. The 
partnership business is carried on partially within and partially 
without State X. Neither C nor the partnership maintains records from 
which the portion of C's $75,000 income which is considered to be 
derived from sources within State X can be satisfactorily proven. As 
determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the partnership's 
``property percentage'' in State X is 70, its ``payroll percentage'' 
therein is 60, and its ``gross income percentage'' therein is 56. The 
amount of C's partnership income considered to be derived from sources 
within State X is $46,500 ($75,000 x 62 percent). This result would 
obtain even if C's services for the partnership are performed entirely 
within State X.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in (3), except that the records 
of the partnership of which C is a member indicate that the net profits 
of the partnership are derived 40 percent from business activities 
conducted in State X, and 60 percent from business activities conducted 
in State Y. C is requested to prove that those records fairly and 
equitably reflect the income which is allocable to sources within State 
X. The documentary evidence which he adduces in support of the 
allocation made by the records shows how such allocation results from a 
careful step-by-step tracing of the profitability of each phase and 
aspect of the partnership's operations, and shows the State in which 
each such phase and aspect of the operations is conducted. C's proof is 
satisfactory to show that the percentage allocation, and the amount of 
his partnership income considered to be derived from sources within 
State X is $30,000, or $75,000 multiplied by 40 percent. This result 
would obtain even if B's services for the partnership are performed 
entirely within State X.

Sec. 301.6362-6  Requirements relating to residence.

    (a) In general. A tax imposed by a State meets the requirements of 
section 6362(e) and this section if in effect it provides that:
    (1) The State of residence of an individual, estate, or trust is 
determined according to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) respectively, of 
section 6362(e), and according to paragraph (b), (c), or (d), 
respectively, of this section.
    (2) The liability for a resident tax imposed by such State upon an 
individual or trust which changes residence to another State in the 
taxable year is determined according to section 6362(e)(4) and paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (3) The rules relating to current collection of tax apply as 
provided in section 6362(e)(5) and paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Residence of an individual--(1) In general. Except as otherwise 
provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph (b), an individual is 
treated as a resident of a State with respect to a taxable year only if:
    (i) His principal place of residence (as defined in subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph (b)) is within such State for a period of at least 135 
consecutive days, at least 30 days of which are in such taxable year; or
    (ii) In the case of a citizen or resident of the United States who 
is not a resident of any State (determined as provided in subdivision 
(i) of this subparagraph) with respect to such taxable year, his 
domicile (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b)) is in 
such State for at least 30 days during such taxable year.

With respect to an individual who is a resident (determined as provided 
in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) of more than one State during a 
taxable year, see paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Principal place of residence--(i) Definition. For purposes of 
subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section, the term ``principal place of residence'' shall mean the place 
which is an individual's primary home. An individual's temporary absence 
from his primary home shall not effect a change with respect thereto. On 
the other hand, if an individual moves to another State, other than as a 
mere transient or sojourner, he shall be treated as having changed the 
location of his primary home.
    (ii) Examples. The application of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A has a city home and a country home. He resides in the 
city home for 7 months of the year and uses the address of

[[Page 260]]

that home as his legal residence for purposes of driver's license, 
automobile registration, and voter registration. He resides in the 
country home 5 months of the year. His city home is considered his 
principal place of residence.
    Example 2. During the taxable year, B, a construction worker, is 
employed at several different locations in different States. The 
duration of each job on which he is employed ranges from a few weeks to 
several months, and he knows when he accepts a job what its approximate 
duration will be. He owns a house in State X which he uses as his legal 
residence for purposes of driver's license, automobile registration, and 
voter registration. In addition, his family lives there during the 
entire year, and B lives there during periods between jobs. However, the 
duration of the jobs and the distance between the job-sites and his 
house require him to live in the localities of the respective job-sites 
during the period of his employment, although occasionally he returns to 
his house in State X on weekends. B's house in State X is his principal 
place of residence during all of the taxable year.
    Example 3. C, a dependent of his parents who are residents of State 
X, is a full-time student in a 4-year degree program at a college in 
State Y. During the 9-month academic year, C lives on the college 
campus, but he returns to his parents' home in State X for the summer 
recess. C gives the State Y as his residence for purposes of his 
driver's license and voter registration, but lists the address of his 
parents' home in State X as his ``permanent address'' on the records of 
the college which he attends. Although C's domicile remains at his 
parents' home in State X, his presence in State Y cannot be regarded as 
that of a mere transient or sojourner; accordingly, C's principal place 
of residence is in State Y for that portion of the taxable year during 
which he attends college.
    Example 4. D loses his job in State X, where he lived and worked for 
many years. After a series of unsuccessful attempts to find other 
employment in State X, he accepts a job in State Y. D gives up his 
apartment in State X and moves to State Y upon commencing his new job; 
however, he intends to continue to explore available employment 
opportunities in State X so that he may return there as soon as an 
opportunity to do so arises. D changes his principal place of residence 
when he moves to State Y.

    (3) Domicile defined. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this 
paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the term 
``domicile'' shall mean an individual's fixed or permanent home. An 
individual acquires a domicile in a place by living there; even for a 
brief period of time, with no definite present intention of later 
removing therefrom. Residence without the requisite intention to remain 
indefinitely will not suffice to change domicile, nor will intention to 
change domicile effect such a change until accompanied by actual 
removal. A domicile, once acquired, is maintained until a new domicile 
is acquired.
    (4) Period of residence--(i) General rule. An individual who becomes 
a resident of a State pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(b), or who is at the beginning of a taxable year a resident of a State 
pursuant to such provision, shall be treated as continuing to be a 
resident of such State through the end of the taxable year, unless, 
prior thereto, such individual becomes a resident, under the principles 
of subparagraph (1), of another State or a possession or foreign 
country. In the event that the individual becomes a resident of such 
another jurisdiction prior to the end of the taxable year, his residence 
in such State shall be treated as ending on the day prior to the day on 
which he becomes a resident of such other jurisdiction pursuant to 
subparagraph (1).
    (ii) Examples. The application of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, has his principal place of 
residence in State X from the beginning of 1976 through August 1, 1976, 
when he gives up pemanently such principal place of residence. He spends 
the remainder of 1976 traveling outside of the United States, but does 
not become a resident of any other country. A is considered to be a 
resident of State X for the entire year 1976.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that A 
ceases his traveling and establishes his principal place of residence in 
State Y on November 15, 1976. Assume, also, that A maintains that 
principal place of residence for more than 135 consecutive days. Under 
these circumstances, for his taxable year 1976, A is considered to be a 
resident of State X from January 1 through November 14, and a resident 
of State Y from November 15 through December 31.

    (5) Special rules. (i) No provision of subchapter E or the 
regulations thereunder shall be construed to require or authorize the 
treatment of a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident 
Commissioner as a resident of a State

[[Page 261]]

other than the State which he represents in Congress.
    (ii) For special rules relating to members of the Armed Forces, see 
paragraph (h) of Sec. 301.6362-7.
    (6) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, maintains his principal 
place of residence in State X from December 1, 1976, through April 15, 
1977. Assuming that A was not a resident of any other jurisdiction at 
any time during 1976, A is treated as a resident of State X for the 
entire year 1976. Such result would obtain even if A was absent from 
State X on vacation for some portion of December 1976. Moreover, such 
result would obtain even if it is assumed that A was a domiciliary of 
State Y from January 1, 1976, through April 15, 1977, because an 
individual's domicile does not determine his residence so long as 
residence in one State for the taxable year can be determined from the 
general rule stated in the first sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 (including the fact 
of A's domicile in State Y), except that A maintained his principal 
place of residence in State Z from September 15, 1975, through January 
31, 1976, inclusive. With respect to the year 1976, A is treated as a 
resident of State Z from January 1 through November 30, and as a 
resident of State X from December 1 through December 31. A's liability 
for the qualified taxes of the respective States for 1976 shall be 
determined pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.

    (c) Residence of an estate. An estate of an individual is treated as 
a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as 
determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, prior to 
his death. However, the estate of an individual who was not a resident 
of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and 
who was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period 
ending on the date of his death, is not treated as a resident of any 
State. For purposes of determining the decedent's last State of 
residence, the rules of paragraph (b) shall be applied irrespective of 
whether subchapter E was in effect at the time the period of 135 
consecutive days of residence began, or whether the decedent's last 
State of residence is a State electing to enter into an agreement 
pursuant to subchapter E. The determination of the State of residence of 
an estate pursuant to this paragraph shall not be governed by any 
determination under State law as to which State is treated as the 
residence or domicile of the decedent for purposes other than its 
individual income tax (such as liability for State inheritance tax or 
jurisdiction of probate proceedings).
    (d) Residence of a trust--(1) In general. (i) The State of residence 
of a trust shall be determined by reference to the circumstances of the 
individual who, by either an inter-vivos transfer or a testamentary 
transfer, is deemed to be the ``principal contributor'' to the trust 
under the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
    (ii) If only one individual has ever contributed assets to the 
trust, including the assets which were transferred to the trust at its 
inception, then such individual is the principal contributor to the 
trust. However, if on any day subsequent to the initial creation of the 
trust, such trust receives assets having a value greater than the 
aggregate value of all assets theretofore contributed to it, then the 
trust shall be deemed (for the limited purpose of determining the State 
of residence) to have been ``created'' anew, and the individual who on 
the day of such creation contributed more (in value) than any other 
individual contributed on that day shall become the principal 
contributor to the trust. When a trust is created anew, all references 
in this paragraph to the creation of the trust shall be construed as 
referring to the most recent creation. For purposes of this paragraph, 
the value of any asset shall be its fair market value on the day that it 
was contributed to the trust; any subsequent appreciation or 
depreciation in the value of the asset shall be disregarded.
    (2) Testamentary trust. A trust with respect to which a deceased 
individual is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on 
his death is treated as a resident of the last State of which such 
individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph 
(b) of this section, before his death. However, if such deceased 
individual was not a resident of any State

[[Page 262]]

(as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and was not a 
resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period ending on the 
date of his death, then a testamentary trust of which he is the 
principal contributor by reason of property passing on his death is not 
treated as a resident of any State. All property passing on the 
transferor's death is treated for this purpose as a contribution made to 
the trust on the date of death, regardless of when the property is 
actually paid over to the trust.
    (3) Nontestamentary trust. A trust which is not a trust described in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), is treated as a resident of the 
State in which the principal contributor to the trust, during the 3-year 
period ending on the date of the creation of the trust, had his 
principal place of residence for an aggregate number of days longer than 
the aggregate number of days he had his principal place of residence in 
any other State. However, if the principal contributor to such a trust 
was not a resident of any State at any time during such 3-year period, 
then the trust is not treated as a resident of any State.
    (4) Special rules. If the application of the provisions of the 
foregoing subparagraphs of this paragraph results in a determination of 
more than one State of residence for a trust, or does not provide a rule 
by which the residence or nonresidence of the trust can be determined, 
then the determination of the State of residence of such trust shall be 
made according to the rules of the applicable subdivision of this 
subparagraph.
    (i) If, at the time of creation of the trust, 50 percent or more in 
value of the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust 
shall be treated as a resident of the State in which more of the real 
property (in value) which was in the trust at such time was located than 
any other State.
    (ii) If, at the time of creation of the trust, less than 50 percent 
in value of the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust 
shall be treated as a resident of the State in which, at such time, the 
trustee, if an individual, had his principal place of residence, or, if 
a corporation, had its principal place of business. If there were two or 
more trustees, then the foregoing sentence shall be applied by reference 
to the principal places of residence, or of business, of the majority of 
trustees who had authority to make investment and other management 
decisions for the trust.
    (iii) If, after application of the provisions of subdivisions (i) 
and (ii) of this subparagraph, the State of residence of the trust still 
cannot be ascertained, then the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall 
determine the State of residence of such trust for purposes of qualified 
taxes. Such determination shall be made by reference to the number of 
significant contacts each State had with the trust at the time of its 
creation. Significant contacts shall include the principal place of 
residence of the principal contributor or contributors to the trust, the 
principal place of residence or business of the trustee (or trustees), 
the situs of the assets of which the trust corpus was composed, and the 
location from which management decisions emanated with respect to the 
business and investment interests of the trusts.
    (5) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. A created a trust in 1950 by transferring to it certain 
stock in a corporation. At the time of such transfer, the stock had a 
fair market value of $1,000. A at all relevant times had his principal 
place of residence in State X, and accordingly the trust is treated as a 
resident of such State for qualified tax purposes. As of January 1, 
1977, the stock originally contributed by A, which was at all times the 
only property in the trust, has a fair market value of $3,000. On such 
date, B, who has had his principal place of residence in State Y for 
more than 3 years, contributes to the trust property having a fair 
market value of $1,200. For purposes of determining the identity of the 
principal contributor to the trust and the State of residence of the 
trust, the stock contributed by A in 1950 continues to be valued for 
such purposes at $1,000. Thus, the trust is treated as being created 
anew on January 1, 1977, with B as the principal contributor, and with 
State Y as its State of residence.
    Example 2. C has his principal place of residence in State X 
continuously for many years, until August 1, 1978, when he establishes 
his principal place of residence in

[[Page 263]]

State Y. The change of residence is intended to be permanent, and C has 
no further contact with State X after such change. On January 1, 1980, C 
creates a nontestamentary trust. During the 3-year period ending on such 
date C had his principal place of residence in State X for 576 days, and 
in State Y for 519 days. Therefore, the trust is treated as a resident 
of State X.

    (e) Liability for tax on change of residence during taxable year--
(1) In general. If, under the principles contained in paragraph (b) or 
(d) of this section, an individual or trust becomes a resident, or 
ceases to be a resident, of a State, and is also a resident of another 
jurisdiction outside of such State during the same taxable year, the 
liability of such individual or trust for the resident tax of such State 
shall be determined by multiplying the amount which would be his or its 
liability for tax (computed after allowing the nonrefundable credits 
(i.e., credits not corresponding to the credits referred to in section 
6401(b) available against the tax)) if he or it had been a resident of 
such State for the entire taxable year by a fraction, the numerator of 
which is the number of days he or it was a resident of such State during 
the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total number of 
days in the taxable year. The preceding sentence shall not apply by 
reason of the fact that an individual is born or dies during the taxable 
year, or by reason of the fact that a trust comes into existence or 
ceases to exist during the taxable year.
    (2) Residence determined by domicile. When an individual is treated 
as a resident of a State by reason of being domiciled in such State, 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, then the numerator of 
the fraction provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e), shall 
be the number of days the individual was domiciled in the State during 
the taxable year.
    (3) Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, is a resident of State X 
continuously for many years prior to March 15, 1977. On such date, A 
retires and establishes a new principal place of residence in State Y. A 
earns $6,000 in 1977 prior to March 15, but receives no taxable income 
for the remainder of such year. If A had been a resident of State X for 
the entire taxable year 1977, his liability with respect to the 
qualified tax of such State (computed after allowing the nonrefundable 
credits available against the tax) would be $600. If he had been a 
resident of State Y for the entire taxable year 1977, his liability with 
respect to the qualified tax on that State (computed similarly) would be 
$400. Pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section, A's 
liabilities for State qualified taxes for 1977 are as follows:

Liability for State X tax = $600  x 73/365 = $120
Liability for State Y Tax = $400  x 292/365 = $320.

    (f) Current collection of tax. The State tax laws shall contain 
provisions for methods of current collection with respect to individuals 
which correspond to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 
with respect to such current collection, including chapter 24 (relating 
to the collection of income tax at source on wages) and sections 6015, 
6073, 6153, and other provisions of the Code relating to declarations 
(and amendments thereto) and payments of estimated income tax. Except as 
otherwise provided by Federal statute (see paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) 
of Sec. 301.6362-7), in applying such provisions of the State tax laws:
    (1) In the case of a resident tax, an individual shall be subject to 
the current collection provisions if either--
    (i) He is a resident of the State within the meaning of paragraph 
(b) of this section, or
    (ii) He has his principal place of residence (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within the State,

And it is reasonable to expect him to have it within the State for 30 
days or more during the taxable year.
    (2) In the case of a nonresident tax, an individual shall be subject 
to the current collection provisions if he does not meet either 
description relating to an individual in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph (f), if he is not exempt from liability for the tax by reason 
for a reciprocal agreement between the State of which he is a resident 
and the State imposing the tax, and if it is reasonable to expect him to 
receive wage or other business income derived from sources within the 
State imposing the tax (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.6362-5) 
for services performed on 30 days or more of the taxable year.

For additional rules relating to withholding see paragraph (d) of 
Sec. 301.6361-1.

[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59369, Dec. 20, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6362-7  Additional requirements.

    A State tax meets the additional requirements of section 6362(f) and 
this section only if:
    (a) State agreement must be in effect for period concerned. A State 
agreement, as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6361-4, is in effect 
with respect to such tax for the taxable period in question.
    (b) State laws must contain certain provisions. Under the laws of 
such State, the provisions of subchapter E and the regulations 
thereunder, as in effect from time to time, are applicable for the 
entire period for which the State agreement is in effect. Any change 
made by the State in such tax (other than an adjustment in the State law 
which is made solely in order to comply with a change in the Federal Law 
or regulations) shall not apply to taxable years beginning in any 
calendar year for which the State agreement is in effect unless the 
change is enacted before November 1 of such year.
    (c) State individual income tax laws can be only of certain kinds. 
Such State does not impose any tax on the income of individuals other 
than (1) a qualified resident tax, and (2) either or both a qualified 
nonresident tax and a separate tax on income which is not wage and other 
business income as defined in paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6362-5 and which 
is received or accrued by individuals who are domiciled in the State, 
but who are not residents of the State (as defined in paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 301.6362-6). For purposes of this paragraph, a tax imposed on the 
amount taxed under section 56 (as permitted under Sec. 301.6362-2(b)(2)) 
shall be treated as an adjustment to and a part of the qualified 
resident tax. Also, tax laws which were in effect prior to the effective 
date of a State agreement and which are not repealed, but which are made 
inapplicable for the period during which the State agreement is in 
effect, shall be disregarded.
    (d) Taxable years must coincide. The taxable years of all 
individuals, estates, and trusts under such tax are required to coincide 
with their taxable years used for purposes of the taxes imposed by 
chapter 1. Accordingly, when subchapter E begins to apply to a State, a 
taxpayer whose taxable year for purposes of the Federal income tax is 
different from his taxable year for purposes of the State income tax 
which precedes the qualified tax may have one short taxable year for 
purposes of such State income tax, so that thereafter his taxable years 
for purposes of the qualified tax will coincide with the Federal taxable 
year.
    (e) Married individuals. Individuals who are married within the 
meaning of section 143 of the Code are prohibited from filing (1) a 
joint return for purposes of such State tax if they file separate 
Federal income tax returns, or (2) separate returns for purposes for 
such State tax if they file a joint Federal income tax return.
    (f) Penalties; no double jeopardy. Under the laws of such State:
    (1) Civil and criminal sanctions identical to those provided by 
subtitle F, and by title 18 of the United States Code (relating to 
crimes and criminal procedures), with respect to the taxes imposed on 
the income of individuals by chapter 1 and on the wages of individuals 
by chapter 24, apply to individuals and their employers who are subject 
to such State tax (and the collection and administration thereof, 
including the corresponding withholding tax imposed to implement the 
current collection of such State tax) as if such tax were imposed by 
chapter 1 or chapter 24, in the case of the withholding tax), except to 
the extent that the application of such sanctions is modified by 
regulations issued under subchapter E; and
    (2) No other sanctions or penalties apply with respect to any act or 
omission to act in respect of such State tax.

See also paragraph (e) of Sec. 301.6361-1 with respect to criminal 
penalties.
    (g) Partnerships, trusts, subchapter S corporations, and other 
conduit entities. Under the laws of such State, the State tax treatment 
of--
    (1) Partnerships and partners,
    (2) Trusts and their beneficiaries,
    (3) Estate and their beneficiaries,
    (4) Electing small business corporations (within the meaning of 
section 1371(a) and their shareholders, and

[[Page 265]]

    (5) Any other entity and the individuals having beneficial interests 
therein (such as a cooperative corporation and its shareholders), to the 
extent that such entity is treated as a conduit for purposes of the 
taxes imposed by chapter 1, corresponds to the tax treatment provided 
therefor with respect to the taxes imposed by chapter 1. For example, a 
subchapter S corporation shall not be subject to the State's corporate 
income tax on amounts which are includible in shareholders incomes which 
are subject to that State's individual income tax, except to the extent 
that the subchapter S corporation is subject to tax under Federal law. 
Similarly, a partnership shall not be subject to the State's 
unincorporated business income tax on amounts which are includible in 
partners' incomes which are subject to that State's individual income 
tax. However, the laws of the State which set forth the provisions of 
such State individual income tax shall authorize the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue to require that the conduit entities described in this 
paragraph (or some of them) supply information to the Federal Government 
with respect to the source of income, the State of residence, or the 
amount of income of a particular type, of an individual, estate, or 
trust holding a beneficial interest in such conduit entity.
    (h) Members of armed forces. The relief provided to any member of 
the Armed Forces by section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil 
Relief Act (50 U.S.C. App. section 574) is in no way diminished. 
Accordingly, for purposes of such State tax, an individual shall not be 
considered to have become a resident of a State solely because of his 
absence from his original State of residence under military order. 
Moreover, compensation for military service shall not be considered as 
income derived from a source within a State of which the individual 
earning such compensation is not a resident, within the meaning of 
paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.6362-5. The preceding sentence shall not apply 
to nonmilitary compensation. Thus, for example, if an individual who is 
serving in State X as a member of the Armed Forces, and who is regarded 
as a resident of State Y under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief 
Act, earns nonmilitary income in State X from a part-time job, such 
nonmilitary income may be subject to a qualified nonresident tax imposed 
by State X.
    (i) Withholding on compensation of employees of railroads, motor 
carriers, airlines, and water carriers. There is no contravention of the 
provisions of section 26, 226A, or 324 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 
or of section 1112 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, with respect to 
the withholding of compensation to which such sections apply for 
purposes of the nonresident tax.
    (j) Income derived from interstate commerce. There is no 
contravention of the provisions of the Act of September 14, 1959 (73 
Stat. 555), with respect to the taxation of income derived from 
interstate commerce to which such statute applies.

[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59372, Dec. 20, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6363-1  State agreements.

    (a) Notice of election. If a State elects to enter into a State 
agreement it shall file notice of such election with the Secretary or 
his delegate. The notice of election shall include the following:
    (1) Statement by the Governor. A written statement by the Governor 
of the electing State:
    (i) Requesting that the Secretary enter into a State agreement, and
    (ii) Binding the Governor and his successors in office to notify the 
Secretary or his delegate immediately of the enactment, between the time 
of the filing of the notice of election and the time of the execution of 
the State agreement, of any law of that State which meets the 
description given in any of the subdivisions of subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph (a), whether or not such law is intended to be administered by 
the United States pursuant to subchapter E.
    (2) Copy of State laws. Certified copies of all laws of that State 
described in any of the following subdivisions of this subparagraph, and 
a specification of laws described in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph as ``subchapter E laws'', of laws described in subdivision 
(ii) as ``other tax laws'', of laws described in subdivision (iii) as 
``non-tax laws'', and of laws described in subdivision (iv) as 
``interstate cooperation laws'':

[[Page 266]]

    (i) All of the State individual income tax laws (including laws 
relating to the collection or administration of such taxes or to the 
prosecution of alleged civil or criminal violations with respect to such 
taxes) which the State would expect the United States to administer 
pursuant to subchapter E if the State agreement is executed as 
requested. In order to have a valid notice, the State must have a tax 
which would meet the requirements for qualification specified in section 
6362 and the regulations thereunder if a State agreement were in effect 
with respect thereto, with no conditions attached to the effectiveness 
of such tax other than the execution of a State agreement. Such tax must 
be effective no later than the January 1 specified in the State's notice 
of election as the date as of which subchapter E is desired to become 
applicable to the electing State, except that such effective date shall 
be deferred to the date provided in the State agreement for the 
beginning of applicability of subchapter E to the State, if the latter 
date is different from the date specified in the notice of election.
    (ii) All of the State income tax laws applicable to individuals 
(including laws relating to the collection or administration of such 
taxes or to the prosecution of alleged civil or criminal violations with 
respect to such taxes) which the State would not expect the United 
States to administer but which may be in effect simultaneously (for any 
period of time) with the State agreement.
    (iii) All of the State laws other than individual income tax laws 
which provide for the making of any payments by the State based on one 
or more criteria which the State may desire to verify by reference to 
information contained in returns of qualified taxes.
    (iv) All of the State laws which may be in effect simultaneously 
(for any period of time) with the State agreement and which provide for 
cooperation or reciprocal agreement between the electing State and 
another State with respect to income taxes applicable to individuals.
    (3) Approval by legislature or authorization by constitutional 
amendment. A certified copy of an Act or Resolution of the legislature 
of the electing State in which the legislature affirmatively expresses 
its approval of the State's entry into a State agreement, or a certified 
copy of an amendment to the constitution of such State by which the 
voters of the State affirmatively authorize such entry.
    (4) Opinion by State Attorney General or judgment of highest court. 
A written statement by the State Attorney General to the effect that, in 
his opinion, no provision of the State's Constitution would be violated 
by the State law's incorporation by reference of the Federal individual 
income tax laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, by the 
Federal prosecution and trial of individuals who are alleged to have 
committed crimes with respect to the State's qualified tax (when it goes 
into effect as such), or by any other provision relating to such tax, 
considered as of the time it is being collected and administered by the 
Federal Government pursuant to subchapter E. However, if such a 
statement is not included in the notice of election, a judgment of the 
highest court of the State to the same effect may be submitted in its 
place.
    (5) Effective date. A written specification of the January as of 
which subchapter E is desired to become applicable to the electing 
State.
    (b) Rules relating to time for filing notice of election. An 
electing State must file its notice of election more than 6 months prior 
to the January 1 as of which the notice specifies that the provisions of 
subchapter E are desired to become applicable to such State. Thus, for 
example, if the date specified in the notice is January 1, 1979, the 
notice must be filed no later than June 30, 1978. However, because under 
the provisions of section 204(b) of the Federal-State Tax Collection Act 
of 1972 (86 Stat. 945), as amended by section 2116(a) of the Tax Reform 
Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 1910), the provisions of subchapter E will 
initially take effect on the first January 1 which is more than 1 year 
after the first date on which at least one State has filed a notice of 
its election (see Sec. 301.6361-5), the notice of an election which 
causes subchapter E to initially take effect must be filed with the 
Secretary or his delegate

[[Page 267]]

more than 1 year prior to the January 1 as of which such notice 
specifies that the provisions of subchapter E are desired to become 
applicable to such State. Thus, for example, if such an initially 
electing State desires to elect subchapter E as of January 1, 1979, its 
notice must be filed no later than December 31, 1977. For purposes of 
this section, if the notice of election is sent by either registered or 
certified mail to the Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220, 
then it shall be deemed to be filed on the date of mailing; otherwise, 
the notice of election shall be deemed to be filed when it is received 
by the Secretary or his delegate.
    (c) Procedures relating to defects in notice or tax laws. If a State 
has filed a notice of election, then the Secretary shall, within 90 days 
after the notice is filed, notify the Governor of such State in writing 
of any defect in the notice of election which prevents it from being 
valid, and of any defect in the State's tax laws which causes the tax 
submitted to fail to meet the requirements for qualification specified 
in section 6362 and the regulations thereunder, other than the fact that 
no State agreement is in effect with respect thereto. Any such defect of 
which the Secretary does not notify the Governor within such 90-day 
period is waived. The Secretary or his delegate may, in his discretion, 
permit any of such defects of which the Governor is timely notified to 
be cured retroactively to the date of the filing of the notice of 
election, by amendment of the notice or the State law. Judicial review 
of the Secretary's determination that the notice of election or the tax 
laws, or both, contain defects, may be obtained as set forth in section 
6363(d) and Sec. 301.6363-4.
    (d) Execution and contents of State agreement. If the Secretary does 
not timely notify the Governor of a defect in the notice of election or 
in the State's tax laws, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
or if, as provided in such paragraph, all such defects have been cured 
retroactively, then the Secretary shall enter into a State agreement. 
The agreement shall include the following elements:
    (1) Effective date. The agreement shall specify the January 1 as of 
which subchapter E will commence to be applicable to the State. Such 
date shall be the same as that specified in the notice of election 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section, unless the parties agree 
to a different January 1, except that in no event shall a State 
agreement executed after November 1 specify the next January 1.
    (2) Obligation of Governor to notify the United States of changes in 
pertinent State laws. The agreement shall require the Governor of the 
State, and his successors in office, to notify the Secretary or his 
delegate within 30 days of the enactment of any law of the State, after 
the execution of the agreement, of a type described in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (3) Obligation of Governor to furnish to the United States 
information needed to administer State tax laws. The agreement shall 
require the Governor and his successors to furnish to the Secretary or 
his delegate any information needed by the Federal Government to 
administer the State tax laws. Such information shall include, for 
example, a list (which shall be maintained on a current basis) of those 
obligations of the State or its political subdivisions described in 
section 103(a)(1) from which the interest is not subject to the 
qualified taxes of the State.
    (4) Identification of State official to act as liaison with Federal 
Government. The agreement shall include a designation by the Governor of 
the State official or officials with whom the Secretary or his delegate 
should coordinate in connection with any questions or problems which may 
arise during the period for which the State agreement is effective, 
including those which may result from changes or contemplated changes in 
pertinent State laws.
    (5) Identification of State official to receive transferred funds. 
The agreement shall include a designation by the Governor of the State 
official who shall initially receive the funds on behalf of the State 
when they are transferred pursuant to section 6361(c) and Sec. 301.6361-
3.
    (6) Other obligations. If the Secretary and the Governor both so 
agree, the agreement shall provide for additional obligations.

[[Page 268]]

    (e) State agreement superseding certain other agreements. For the 
period of its effectiveness, a State agreement shall supersede an 
otherwise effective agreement entered into by the State and the 
Secretary for the withholding of State income taxes from the 
compensation of Federal employees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5517 (or pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 5516, in the case of the District of Columbia).

<R05>
Sec. 301.6363-2  Withdrawal from State agreements.

    (a) By notification. If a State which has entered into a State 
agreement desires to withdraw from the agreement, its Governor shall 
file a notice of withdrawal with the Secretary or his delegate. A notice 
of withdrawal shall include the following documents:
    (1) Request by the Governor. A request by the Governor of the State 
that the State agreement cease to be effective with respect to taxable 
years beginning on or after a specified January 1, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 301.6365-2 with respect to withholding in the 
case of fiscal year taxpayers.
    (2) Legislative approval of withdrawal. A certified copy of an act 
or Resolution of the legislature of the State in which the legislature 
affirmatively expresses its approval of the State's withdrawal from the 
State agreement.
    (3) Identification of State official. A written identification of 
the State official or officials with whom the Secretary or his delegate 
should coordinate in connection with the State's withdrawal from the 
State agreement.
    (b) By change in State law. If any law of a State which has entered 
into a State agreement is enacted pertaining to individual income taxes 
(including the collection or administration of such taxes, and the 
prosecution of alleged civil or criminal violations with respect to such 
taxes), and if the Secretary or his delegate determines that as a result 
of such law the State no longer has a qualified tax, then such change in 
the State law shall be treated as a notification of withdrawal from the 
agreement. The Secretary shall notify the Governor in writing when a 
change is to be so treated. Such notification shall have the same effect 
as if, on the effective date of the disqualifying change in the law, the 
Governor had filed with the Secretary or his delegate a valid and 
sufficient notice of withdrawal requesting that the State agreement 
cease to be effective with respect to taxable years beginning on or 
after the first January 1 which is more than 6 months thereafter, 
subject to the exception with respect to withholding in the case of 
fiscal-year taxpayers. However, the cessation of effectiveness may be 
deferred to a subsequent January 1 if the Governor so requests and if 
the Secretary or his delegate in his discretion determines that the date 
of cessation provided in the preceding sentence would subject the State 
or its taxpayers to undue hardship. In addition, the Governor may 
request the Secretary or his delegate to permit the State's early 
withdrawal from the agreement, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. Until the date of cessation of effectiveness of the State 
agreement, the change in State law which was treated as a notification 
of withdrawal, and any other such subsequent change that would be 
similarly treated, shall not be given effect for purposes of the Federal 
collection and administration of the State taxes. Similarly, such 
changes shall not be given effect for such purposes during the period of 
litigation if the State seeks judicial review of the action of the 
Secretary or his delegate pursuant to section 6363(d) or Sec. 301.6363-
4, even if such changes are ultimately found by the court not to 
disqualify the State's qualified tax. However, a change in State law 
which would be treated as a notice of withdrawal in the absence of this 
sentence shall not be so treated if, prior to the last November 1 
preceding the January 1 on which the cessation of effectiveness of the 
State agreement is to occur, either such change in State law is 
retroactively repealed, or the State law is retroactively modified and 
the Secretary or his delegate determines that with such modification the 
State has a qualified tax.
    (c) Rules relating to time of withdrawal--(1) General rule. Except 
as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c), a notice of 
withdrawal shall not be valid unless the January 1 specified therein is 
not earlier than the first January 1 which is more than 6 months

[[Page 269]]

subsequent to the date on which the notice is received by the Secretary 
or his delegate. Thus, for example, if the notice specifies January 1, 
1980, for withdrawal, the notice must be received no later than June 30, 
1979.
    (2) Early withdrawal. The Secretary or his delegate may, in his 
discretion and upon written request by a Governor of a State who has 
filed a notice of withdrawal, waive the 6-months requirement of section 
6363(b)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), if the Secretary 
determines that:
    (i) The State will suffer a hardship if required to meet such 
requirement, and
    (ii) The early withdrawal requested by the Governor would be 
practicable from the standpoint of orderly collection of the qualified 
tax and administration of the State law by the Federal Government.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6363-3  Transition years.

    The State may by law provide for the transition to or from a 
qualified tax to the extent necessary to prevent double taxation or 
other unintended hardships, or to prevent unintended benefits, under 
State law. Generally, such provisions shall be administered by the 
State; but, if requested to do so by the Governor of the State, the 
Secretary or his delegate may in his discretion, agree to administer 
such provisions either solely or jointly with the State.

[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59375, Dec. 20, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6363-4  Judicial review.

    (a) General rule. If the Secretary or his delegate determines 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6363-1 that a State did not file a 
valid notice of election or does not have a tax which would meet the 
requirements for qualification specified in section 6362 and the 
regulations thereunder if a State agreement were in effect with respect 
thereto, or if he determines pursuant to paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6363-
2 that a participating State has enacted a law as a result of which the 
State no longer has a qualified tax, such State may, within 60 days 
after its Governor has received notification of such determination, file 
a petition for the review of such determination with either the United 
States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the State is located or 
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If a 
State files such a petition, the clerk of the court shall forthwith 
transmit a copy of the petition to the Secretary or his delegate, who in 
turn shall thereupon file in the court the record of proceedings on 
which the determination adverse to the State was based, as provided in 
section 2112 of title 28, United States Code.
    (b) Court of Appeals' jurisdiction. The court of Appeals may affirm 
or set aside, in whole or in part, the action of the Secretary or his 
delegate; and (subject to the rules delaying the effectiveness of the 
change in State law provided in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6363-2) the 
court may issue such other orders as may be appropriate with respect to 
taxable years which include any part of the period of litigation.
    (c) Review of Court of Appeals' judgment. The judgment of the Court 
of Appeals shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United 
States upon certiorari or certification sought by either party as 
provided in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.
    (d) Effect of final judgment. If a final judgment, rendered with 
respect to litigation involving a State's petition to review a 
determination of the Secretary or his delegate to the effect that the 
State's individual income tax laws included in its notice of election 
would not meet the requirements for qualification specified in section 
6362 and the regulations thereunder if a State agreement were in effect 
with respect thereto, includes a determination that the State's tax 
would in fact meet such requirements, then the provisions of subchapter 
E shall apply to the State with respect to taxable years beginning on or 
after the first January 1 which is more than 6 months after the date of 
such final judgment. If a final judgment, rendered with respect to 
litigation involving a State's petition to review a determination of the 
Secretary or his delegate to the effect that the State's previously-
qualified tax ceases to qualify because of a change in the State's law, 
includes a determination that the State's tax does in fact cease to 
qualify, then the provisions of subchapter E (other than section 6363)

[[Page 270]]

shall cease to apply to the State with respect to taxable years 
beginning on or after the first January 1 which is more than 6 months 
after the date of such final judgment. See paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 301.6365-2 for special rules with respect to withholding in the 
case of fiscal-year taxpayers.
    (e) Expeditious treatment of judicial proceedings. Under section 
6363(d)(4), any judicial proceedings to which a State and the United 
States are parties, and which are brought pursuant to section 6363, are 
entitled to receive a preference, and to be heard and determined as 
expeditiously as possible, upon request of the Secretary or the State.

Sec. 301.6365-1  Definitions.

    (a) State. For purposes of subchapter E and the regulations 
thereunder, the term ``State'' shall include the District of Columbia,

of the United States.
    (b) Governor. For purposes of subchapter E and the regulations 
thereunder, the term ``Governor'' shall include the Mayor of the 
District of Columbia.

[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59375, Dec. 20, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6365-2  Commencement and cessation of applicability of subchapter E to individual taxpayers.

    (a) General rule. Except for purposes of chapter 24 (relating to the 
collection of income tax at source on wages), whenever subchapter E 
begins or ceases to apply to any State (i.e., a State agreement begins 
or ceases to be effective) as of any January 1, such commencement or 
cessation of applicability shall apply to taxable years of individuals 
beginning on or after such date. For example, if subchapter E begins to 
apply to a particular State on January 1, 1980, it would become 
applicable for calendar year 1980 for calendar-year taxpayers in that 
State; but if a taxpayer in the State is using a fiscal year running 
from July 1 to June 30, the subchapter would begin to apply (except for 
purposes of chapter 24) to that taxpayer on July 1, 1980, for his 
taxable year ending June 30, 1981. Similarly, if the subchapter ceases 
to apply to such State on January 1, 1982, it would cease to apply to 
calendar-year taxpayers after the end of calendar year 1981; but it 
would cease to apply (except for purposes of chapter 24) to fiscal-year 
taxpayers at the end of their fiscal years which are in progress on 
January 1, 1982. The cessation of applicability of subchapter E to a 
State does not affect rights, duties, and liabilities with respect to 
any taxable year for which subchapter E does apply with respect to any 
taxpayer (or his employer).
    (b) Special rules pertaining to withholding--(1) Subchapter E 
beginning to apply. The Federal withholding system provided in chapter 
24 shall go into effect for State individual income tax purposes with 
respect to wages paid on or after the January 1 as of which subchapter E 
begins to apply to a State. If an employee is subject to a qualified tax 
imposed by the State, such withholding system shall apply to his wages 
paid on or after that January 1, without regard to whether he is a 
calendar-year or fiscal-year taxpayer. See Sec. 301.6363-3 with respect 
to transition-year rules.
    (2) Subchapter E ceasing to apply. The Federal withholding system 
provided in chapter 24 shall cease to be effective for State tax 
purposes with respect to wages paid on or after the January 1 as of 
which subchapter E ceases to apply to the State, although fiscal-year 
taxpayers of that State continue to be subject to the other provisions 
of subchapter E for the remainder of their fiscal years then in 
progress. See Sec. 301.6363-3 with respect to transition-year rules.

Sec. 301.6401-1   Amounts treated as overpayments.

    (a) The term ``overpayment'' includes:
    (1) Any payment of any internal revenue tax which is assessed or 
collected after the expiration of the period of limitation applicable 
thereto.
    (2) Any amount allowable for a taxable year as credits under 
sections 31

gasoline, special fuels, and, lubricating oil), 43 (relating to earned 
income credit), and 667(b) (relating to taxes paid by certain trusts) 
which exceeds the tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code (reduced by the 
credits allowable under subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 
1 of the Code, other than the credits allowable under sections 31, 39, 
and 43) for such year.
    (b) An amount paid as tax shall not be considered not to constitute 
an overpayment solely by reason of the fact that there was no tax 
liability in respect of which such amount was paid.

[T.D. 7204, 37 FR 17158, Aug. 25, 1972, as amended by T.D. 7537, 43 FR

Sec. 301.6402-1  Authority to make credits or refunds.

    The Commissioner, within the applicable period of limitations, may 
credit any overpayment of tax, including interest thereon, against any 
outstanding liability for any tax (or for any interest, additional 
amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty) owed by the person 
making the overpayment and the balance, if any, shall be refunded, 
subject to sections 6402 (c) and (d) and the regulations thereunder, to 
that person by the Commissioner.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6402-2   Claims for credit or refund.

    (a) Requirement that claim be filed. (1) Credits or refunds of 
overpayments may not be allowed or made after the expiration of the 
statutory period of limitation properly applicable unless, before the 
expiration of such period, a claim therefor has been filed by the 
taxpayer. Furthermore, under section 7422, a civil action for refund may 
not be instituted unless a claim has been filed within the properly 
applicable period of limitation.
    (2) In the case of a claim filed prior to April 15, 1968, the claim 
together with appropriate supporting evidence shall be filed in the 
office of the internal revenue officer to whom the tax was paid or with 
the assistant regional Commissioner (alcohol, tobacco, and firearms) 
where the regulations respecting the particular tax to which the claim 
relates specifically require the claim to be filed with that officer. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6091-1 (relating to 
hand-carried documents), in the case of a claim filed after April 14, 
1968, the claim, together with appropriate supporting evidence, shall be 
filed (i) with the Director of International Operations if the tax was 
paid to him or (ii) with the assistant regional Commissioner (alcohol, 
tobacco, and firearms) where the regulations respecting the particular 
tax to which the claim relates specifically require the claim to be 
filed with that officer; otherwise, the claim with appropriate 
supporting evidence must be filed with the service center serving the 
internal revenue district in which the tax was paid. As to interest in 
the case of credits or refunds, see section 6611. See section 7502 for 
provisions treating timely mailing as timely filing and section 7503 for 
time for filing claim when the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday.
    (b) Grounds set forth in claim. (1) No refund or credit will be 
allowed after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation 
applicable to the filing of a claim therefor except upon one or more of 
the grounds set forth in a claim filed before the expiration of such 
period. The claim must set forth in detail each ground upon which a 
credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the 
Commissioner of the exact basis thereof. The statement of the grounds 
and facts must be verified by a written declaration that it is made 
under the penalties of perjury. A claim which does not comply with this 
paragraph will not be considered for any purpose as a claim for refund 
or credit.
    (2) Neither the district director nor the director of the regional 
service center has authority to refund on equitable grounds penalties or 
other amounts legally collected.
    (c) Form for filing claim. Except for claims filed after June 30, 
1976 for the refunding of overpayment of income taxes, all claims by 
taxpayers for the refunding of taxes, interest, penalties, and additions 
to tax shall be made on Form 843. For special rules applicable to income 
tax, see Sec. 301.6402-3. For

[[Page 272]]

other provisions relating to credits and refunds of taxes other than 
income tax, see the regulations relating to the particular tax.
    (d) Separate claims for separate taxable periods. In the case of 
income, gift, and Federal unemployment taxes, a separate claim shall be 
made for each type of tax for each taxable year or period.
    (e) Proof of representative capacity. If a return is filed by an 
individual and, after his death, a refund claim is filed by his legal 
representative, certified copies of the letters testamentary, letters of 
administration, or other similar evidence must be annexed to the claim, 
to show the authority of the legal representative to file the claim. If 
an executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, receiver, or other 
fiduciary files a return and thereafter a refund claim is filed by the 
same fiduciary, documentary evidence to establish the legal authority of 
the fiduciary need not accompany the claim, provided a statement is made 
in the claim showing that the return was filed by the fiduciary and that 
the latter is still acting. In such cases, if a refund is to be paid, 
letters testamentary, letters of administration, or other evidence may 
be required, but should be submitted only upon the receipt of a specific 
request therefor. If a claim is filed by a fiduciary other than the one 
by whom the return was filed, the necessary documentary evidence should 
accompany the claim. A claim may be executed by an agent of the person 
assessed, but in such case a power of attorney must accompany the claim.
    (f) Mailing of refund check. (1) Checks in payment of claims allowed 
will be drawn in the names of the persons entitled to the money and, 
except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), the checks 
may be sent direct to the claimant or to such person in care of an 
attorney or agent who has filed a power of attorney specifically 
authorizing him to receive such checks.
    (2) Checks in payment of claims which have either been reduced to 
judgment or settled in the course or as a result of litigation will be 
drawn in the name of the person or persons entitled to the money and 
will be sent to the Assistant Attorney General, Tax Division, Department 
of Justice, for delivery to the taxpayer or the counsel of record in the 
court proceeding.
    (3) For restrictions on the assignment of claims, see section 3477 
of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 203).

    (a) In the case of a claim for credit or refund filed after June 30, 
1976--
    (1) In general, in the case of an overpayment of income taxes, a 
claim for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be made on the 
appropriate income tax return.
    (2) In the case of an overpayment of income taxes for a taxable year 
of an individual for which a Form 1040 or 1040A has been filed, a claim 
for refund shall be made on Form 1040X (``Amended U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return'').
    (3) In the case of an overpayment of income taxes for a taxable year 
of a corporation for which a Form 1120 has been filed, a claim for 
refund shall be made on Form 1120X (``Amended U.S. Corporation Income 
Tax Return'').
    (4) In the case of an overpayment of income taxes for a taxable year 
for which a form other than Form 1040, 1040A, or 1120 was filed (such as 
Form 1041 (U.S. Fiduciary Income Tax Return) or Form 990T (Exempt 
Organization Business Income Tax Return)), a claim for credit or refund 
shall be made on the appropriate amended income tax return.
    (5) A properly executed individual, fiduciary, or corporation 
original income tax return or an amended return (on 1040X or 1120X if 
applicable) shall constitute a claim for refund or credit within the 
meaning of section 6402 and section 6511 for the amount of the 
overpayment disclosed by such return (or amended return). For purposes 
of section 6511, such claim shall be considered as filed on the date on 
which such return (or amended return) is considered as filed, except 
that if the requirements of Sec. 301.7502-1, relating to timely mailing 
treated as timely filing are

[[Page 273]]

met, the claim shall be considered to be filed on the date of the 
postmark stamped on the cover in which the return (or amended return) 
was mailed. A return or amended return shall constitute a claim for 
refund or credit if it contains a statement setting forth the amount 
determined as an overpayment and advising whether such amount shall be 
refunded to the taxpayer or shall be applied as a credit against the 
taxpayer's estimated income tax for the taxable year immediately 
succeeding the taxable year for which such return (or amended return) is 
filed. If the taxpayer indicates on its return (or amended return) that 
all or part of the overpayment shown by its return (or amended return) 
is to be applied to its estimated income tax for its succeeding taxable 
year, such indication shall constitute an election to so apply such 
overpayment, and no interest shall be allowed on such portion of the 
overpayment credited and such amount shall be applied as a payment on 
account of the estimated income tax for such year or the installments 
thereof.
    (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Internal 
Revenue Service, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit 
any overpayment of individual, fiduciary, or corporation income tax, 
including interest thereon, against--
    (i) First, any outstanding liability for any tax (or for any 
interest, additional amount, additions to the tax, or assessable 
penalty) owed by the taxpayer making the overpayment;
    (ii) Second, in the case of an individual taxpayer, amounts of past-
due support assigned to a State under section 402(a)(26) or 471(a)(17) 
of the Social Security Act under procedures set forth in the regulations 
under section 6402(c);
    (iii) Third, past-due and legally enforceable debt under procedures 
set forth in the regulations under section 6402(d); and
    (iv) Fourth, qualifying amounts of past-due support not assigned to 
a State under procedures set forth in the regulations under section 6402 
(c).
Only the balance, if any, of the overpayment remaining after credits 
described in this paragraph (a)(6) shall be treated in the manner so 
elected.
    (b) In the case of a claim for credit or refund filed before July 1, 
1976--(1) In the case of income tax, claims for refund may not only be 
made on Form 843 but may also be made on any individual, fiduciary, or 
corporation income tax return, or on any amended income tax return.
    (2) In the case of an overpayment for a taxable year of an 
individual for which a Form 1040 or Form 1040A has been filed, claim for 
refund may be made on Form 1040X (``Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax 
Return''). In cases to which this subparagraph applies, the taxpayer is 
encouraged to use Form 1040X.
    (3) In the case of an overpayment for a taxable year of a 
corporation for which a corporation tax return has been filed, claim for 
refund may be made on Form 1120X (``Amended U.S. Corporation Income Tax 
Return''). In cases to which this subparagraph applies, the taxpayer is 
encouraged to use Form 1120X.
    (4) A properly executed individual, fiduciary, or corporation income 
tax return shall, at the election of the taxpayer, constitute a claim 
for refund or credit within the meaning of section 6402 and section 6511 
for the amount of the overpayment disclosed by such return. For purposes 
of section 6511, such claim shall be considered as filed on the date on 
which such return is considered as filed, except that if the 
requirements of Sec. 301.7502-1, relating to timely mailing treated as 
timely filing, are met the claim shall be considered to be filed on the 
date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the return was 
mailed.
    (5) An election to treat the return as a claim for refund or credit 
shall be evidenced by a statement on the return setting forth the amount 
determined as an overpayment and advising whether such amount shall be 
refunded to the taxpayer or shall be applied as a credit against the 
taxpayer's estimated income tax for the taxable year immediately 
succeeding the taxable year for which such return is filed. If the 
taxpayer elects to have all or part of the overpayment shown by his 
return applied to his estimated income tax for his succeeding taxable 
year, no interest shall be allowed on such portion of the

[[Page 274]]

overpayment credited and such amount shall be applied as a payment on 
account of the estimated income tax for such year or the installments 
thereof.
    (6) Notwithstanding elections made under paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section for taxable years ending after December 20, 1972, the 
Commissioner, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit 
any overpayment of individual, fiduciary, or corporation income tax, 
against any outstanding liability for any tax (or for any interest, 
additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty) owed by 
the taxpayer making the overpayment, and only the balance, if any, shall 
be treated in the manner so elected.
    (c) The filing of a properly executed income tax return shall, in 
any case in which the taxpayer is not required to show his tax on such 
form (see section 6014 and the regulations thereunder), be treated as a 
claim for refund (or for claims filed before July 1, 1976, constitute an 
election by the taxpayer to have the return treated as a claim for 
refund), and such return shall constitute a claim for refund within the 
meaning of section 6402 and section 6511 for the amount of the 
overpayment shown by the computation of the tax made by the district 
director or the director of the regional service center on the basis of 
the return. For purposes of section 6511, such claim shall be considered 
as filed on the date on which such return is considered as filed, except 
that if the requirements of Sec. 301.7502-1, relating to timely mailing 
treated as timely filing, are met the claim shall be considered to be 
filed on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the 
return was mailed.
    (d) In any case in which a taxpayer elects to have an overpayment 
refunded to him he may not thereafter change his election to have the 
overpayment applied as a payment on account of his estimated income tax.
    (e) In the case of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign 
corporation the claim for refund must show the taxpayer's entire income 
subject to tax, whether or not the tax has been fully satisfied at the 
source upon a portion of such income. If the overpayment has resulted 
from the withholding of tax at source under chapter 3 of the Code, a 
statement shall be attached to the claim for refund declaring that the 
person making the claim is the beneficial owner of the income and 
showing (1) the amounts of tax withheld, with the names and post office 
addresses of withholding agents, (2) the name in which the tax was 
withheld if other than that of the taxpayer, and, if applicable, (3) 
facts sufficient to show that, at the time the income was derived, the 
taxpayer was entitled to the benefit of a reduced rate of, or exemption 
from, tax with respect to that income under the provisions of an income 
tax convention to which the United States is a party. Upon request of 
the Director of International Operations the taxpayer shall also submit 
such evidence as may be required to show that the taxpayer is the 
beneficial owner of the income. In no case may a claim for refund of 
overwithheld tax be made by a nonresident alien individual or foreign 
corporation if the taxpayer has received a repayment or reimbursement of 
such tax in accordance with paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1461-4 of this 
chapter (Income Tax Regulations). See also Sec. 1.1464-1 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 301.6402-4   Payments in excess of amounts shown on return.

    In certain cases, the taxpayer's payments in respect of his tax 
liability, made before the filing of his return, may exceed the amount 
of tax shown on the return. For example, such payments may arise in the 
case of the income tax when the estimated tax or the credit for income 
tax withheld at the source on wages exceeds the amount of tax shown on 
the return, or where a corporation obtains an extension of time for 
filing its return and makes installment payments based on its estimate 
of its tax liability which exceed the tax liability shown on the

[[Page 275]]

return subsequently filed. In any case in which the district director or 
the director of the regional service center determines that the payments 
by the taxpayer (made within the period prescribed for payment and 
before the filing of the return) are in excess of the amount of tax 
shown on the return, he may make credit or refund of such overpayment 
without awaiting examination of the completed return and without 
awaiting filing of a claim for refund. However, the provisions of 
Secs. 301.6402-2 and 301.6402-3 are applicable to such overpayment, and 
taxpayers should submit claims for refund (if the income tax return is 
not itself a claim for refund, as provided in Sec. 301.6402-3) to 
protect themselves in the event the district director or the director of 
the regional service center fails to make such determination and credit 
or refund. The provisions of section 6405 (relating to reports of 
refunds of more than $100,000 to the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue 
Taxation) are not applicable to the overpayments described in this 
section caused by timely payments of tax which exceed the amount of tax 
shown on a timely return.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6402-5  Offset of past-due support against overpayment.

    (a) Introduction--(1) Scope. Section 6402(c) requires the Secretary 
of the Treasury or his delegate to reduce the amount of any overpayment 
to be refunded to a person making an overpayment by the amount of past-
due support owed by that person of which the Secretary has been notified 
in accordance with section 464 of the Social Security Act. Past-due 
support shall be collected by offset under section 6402(c) and this 
section in the same manner as if it were a liability for tax imposed by 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (except that a liability for tax shall 
be given priority with respect to offset arising under section 6402(a)). 
Collection by offset under section 6402(c) of this section is a 
collection procedure separate from the collection procedures provided by 
section 6305 and Sec. 301.6305-1, relating to assessment and collection 
of certain child and spousal support liabilities. The sole collection 
procedure provided by section 6402(c) and this section is that of offset 
against overpayment. Section 6305 and Sec. 301.6305-1, by contrast, 
provide for other collection procedures in addition to collection by 
offset against overpayment. Sections 6305 and 6402(c) have differing 
procedural requirements and may be used separately or in conjunction 
with each other.
    (2) General rule. An amount of past-due support qualifies for offset 
under this section if it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section. A State shall submit to the Department of Health and Human 
Services a notification of liability for qualifying past-due support 
containing the information described in paragraph (c) of this section. A 
qualifying amount of past-due support owed by a taxpayer who has made an 
overpayment shall be collected in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (d), the balance 
of any overpayment remaining after crediting of the overpayment under 
section 6402(a) to any liability for an internal revenue tax on the part 
of the taxpayer shall be offset by the amount of past-due support of 
which the Internal Revenue Service has been notified. The amount of the 
overpayment not subject to offset for any liability for an internal 
revenue tax or for past-due support shall be promptly refunded to the 
taxpayer. Paragraph (e) of this section requires that the Internal 
Revenue Service notify the taxpayer of the amount of the offset and of 
the State to which it has been paid. Under procedures set forth in 
paragraph (f) of this section, amounts collected by offset shall be 
transferred to a special account maintained by the Bureau of Government 
Financial Operations for distribution to the States. The Internal 
Revenue Service shall make monthly collection reports to the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services or his delegate. The States shall reimburse 
the Secretary of the Treasury for the full cost of the refund offset 
under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) Past-due support--(1) Definition. For purposes of this section, 
the term ``past-due support'' means the amount of a delinquent 
obligation, which amount was determined under a court

[[Page 276]]

order, or an order pursuant to an administrative process established 
under State law, for support and maintenance of a child or of a child 
and the parent with whom the child is living.
    (2) Past-due support qualifying for offset. Past-due support 
qualifies for offset under section 6402(c) and this section if--
    (i) There has been as assignment of the support obligation to a 
State pursuant to section 402(a)(26) of the Social Security Act 
(relating to aid and service to needy families with children) and that 
State has made reasonable efforts to collect the amount of the 
obligation;
    (ii) The amount of past-due support is not less than $150.00;
    (iii) The past-due support has been delinquent for three months or 
longer; and
    (iv) A notificaton of liability for past-due support has been 
received by the Secretary of the Treasury as prescribed by paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (c) Notification of liability for past-due support--(1) Form. A 
State shall, by October 1 of each year, submit a notification (or 
notifications) of liability for past-due support on magnetic tape to the 
Special Collection Activities Unit.

Office of Child Support Enforcement, Department of Health and Human 
Services, 6110 Executive Boulevard, Suite 900, Rockville, Maryland 
20852, Attention: Tax Refund Offset--Tape Processing.
    (2) Content. The notification of liability for past-due support 
shall contain with respect to each taxpayer--
    (i) The name of the taxpayer who owes the past-due support;
    (ii) The social security number of that taxpayer;
    (iii) The amount of past-due support owed; and
    (iv) The alphabetical designation of the State submitting the 
notification of liability for past-due support.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services may also require such other 
information from the State submitting the notification as is necessary 
for his orderly consolidation of data for transmittal to the Internal 
Revenue Service.
    (3) Transmittal of notification to Internal Revenue Service. The 
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, by December 1 of each 
year, consolidate and transmit to the Internal Revenue Service on 
magnetic tape the data contained in the notifications of liability for 
past-due support submitted by the participating States.
    (4) Correction of notification. If, after submitting a notification 
of liability for past-due support, a State determines that an error has 
been made with respect to the information contained in the notification, 
or if a State receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of 
a taxpayer named in this notification, the State shall promptly notify 
the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Department of Health and 
Human Services of these corrections in accordance with any time 
limitations specified by the Office of Child Support Enforcement. That 
Office shall promptly transmit these corrections to the Internal Revenue 
Service and the Internal Revenue Service shall make the appropriate 
correction of the notification of liability for past-due support. 
However, in no case shall a State notify the Internal Revenue Service 
under this paragraph (c)(4) of an increased amount of past-due support 
owed by a taxpayer named in its notification of liability for past-due 
support. The correction notification described in this paragraph (c)(4) 
is to be submitted only for the purpose of completing or correcting the 
information contained in the notification of liability for past-due 
support.
    (d) Collection--(1) Priority of offset for outstanding tax 
liability. Under section 6402(a) and Sec. 301.6402-1, the Commissoner 
may credit any overpayment of tax against any outstanding liability for 
any tax owed by the person making the overpayment. Only the balance 
remaining after such crediting is available for offset under section 
6402(c) of this section. Thus, if a taxpayer making an overpayment has 
both an outstanding tax liability and a liability for past-due support 
subject to this section, then the entire amount of the overpayment shall 
be credited first against the outstanding tax liability under section 
6402(a) and Sec. 301.6402-1 and only the remainder, if any, of the 
overpayment will be offset by the amount of past-due support. However,

[[Page 277]]

an overpayment shall be offset by an amount of past-due support under 
section 6402(c) before any crediting of the overpayment to any future 
liability for an internal revenue tax. Thus, for example, if no 
outstanding tax liability is owed and the amount of an overpayment is 
equal to or less than the amount of past-due support, the Internal 
Revenue Service shall offset the overpayment by the amount of past-due 
support before crediting the overpayment against the taxpayer's 
estimated income tax for the succeeding taxable year under section 
6402(b).
    (2) Amounts subject to offset. The balance of any overpayment 
remaining after a crediting of the overpayment under section 6402(a) to 
any outstanding liability for tax on the part of the taxpayer shall be 
offset by the amount of past-due support of which the Internal Revenue 
Service has been notified under this section
    (3) Amounts not subject to offset. The amount of an overpayment not 
subject to offset for any liability for tax or for past-due support 
shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer.
    (e) Notice of offset. The Internal Revenue Service shall notify the 
taxpayer in writing of the amount and date of the offset for past-due 
support and of the State to which this amount of past-due support has 
been paid.
    (f) Disposition of amounts collected. Amounts collected under this 
section shall be transferred to a special account maintained by the 
Bureau of Government Financial Operations. The Internal Revenue Service 
shall advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his delegate 
on a monthly basis of the names and social security numbers of the 
taxpayers from whom the amounts of past-due support were collected, of 
the amounts collected from each taxpayer, and of the State on whose 
behalf each collection was made. After authorization by the Division of 
Finance of the Social Security Administration, the Bureau of Government 
Financial Operations of the Department of the Treasury shall pay to the 
participating States amounts equal to the amounts collected under this 
section.
    (g) Fee. A refund offset fee in the amount of $17.00 per offset for 
taxable year 1981, or such greater or smaller amount as the Secretary of 
the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have agreed 
to be sufficient to reimburse the Internal Revenue Service for the full 
cost of the offset procedure, shall be billed and collected from the 
participating States by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or 
his delegate and deposited in the United States Treasury and credited to 
the appropriation accounts of the Internal Revenue Service which bore 
all or part of the costs involved in making the collection.

Sec. 301.6402-6  Offset of past-due, legally enforceable debt against overpayment.

    (a) General rule. (1) A Federal agency (as defined in section 
6402(f)) that has entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue 
Service with regard to its participation in the tax refund offset 
program and that is owed a past-due, legally enforceable debt may refer 
the past-due, legally enforceable debt to the Internal Revenue Service 
to be collected by Federal tax refund offset. The Service shall, after 
making appropriate credits as provided by Sec. 301.6402-3(a)(6) (i) and 
(ii), reduce the amount of any overpayment payable to a taxpayer by the 
amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to the agency and 
properly referred to the Service. This section does not apply to any 
debt subject to section 464 of the Social Security Act (past-due 
support).
    (2)(i) This section applies to OASDI overpayments provided the 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A(f)(1) and (2) are met with respect to 
such overpayments.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, ``OASDI overpayment'' means any 
overpayment of benefits made to an individual under title II of the 
Social Security Act.
    (b) Eligible Federal agencies. (1) A Federal agency is eligible to 
participate in the tax refund offset program if the agency--
    (i) Has promulgated temporary of final regulations under 31 U.S.C. 
3720A, governing the operation of the Federal tax refund offset program 
in the agency;

[[Page 278]]

    (ii) Has promulgated temporary or final regulations under 31 U.S.C. 
3716, governing the operation of the administrative offset program in 
the agency; and
    (iii) Has promulgated temporary or final regulations under 5 U.S.C. 
5514(a), governing the operation of the salary offset program in the 
agency (unless the agency has certified that, relying on the most 
current information reasonably available, it will not refer to the 
Service any names of present or former Federal employees or other 
persons whose debts are subject to offset under the provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)).
    (2) An agency prohibited by Federal law from meeting any of the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of this section shall notify the 
Service in writing of the specific legal impediment to meeting these 
requirements. This notification shall be made prior to entering into an 
agreement with the Service to participate in the tax refund offset 
program. The Service will determine in writing whether the agency is 
prohibited by Federal law from meeting any of the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of this section. The Service will waive in 
writing any requirement that it determines the agency is prohibited by 
Federal law from meeting.
    (c) Past-due, legally enforceable debt eligible for refund offset. 
For purposes of this section, a Federal agency may refer a past-due, 
legally enforceable debt to the Service for offset if--
    (1) Except in the case of a judgment debt or any debts specifically 
exempt from this requirement (for example, debts referred by the 
Department of Education that were pending on or after April 9, 1991, and 
referred to the Service for offset before November 15, 1992), the debt 
is referred for offset within ten years after the agency's right of 
action accrues;
    (2) The debt cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary 
offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (3) The debt is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 
3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2), or cannot be currently 
collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the 
referring agency against amounts payable to the taxpayer by the 
referring agency;
    (4) The agency has notified, or has made a reasonable attempt to 
notify, the taxpayer that the debt is past-due, and unless repaid within 
60 days thereafter, will be referred to the Service for offset against 
an overpayment of tax;
    (5) The agency has given the taxpayer at least 60 days to present 
evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally 
enforceable, has considered any evidence presented by the taxpayer, and 
has determined that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable;
    (6) The debt has been disclosed by the agency to a consumer 
reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless the consumer 
reporting agency would be prohibited from reporting information 
concerning the debt by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount 
of the debt does not exceed $100;
    (7) The debt is at least $25; and
    (8) In the case of an OASDI overpayment--
    (i) The individual is not currently entitled to monthly insurance 
benefits under title II of the Social Security Act;
    (ii) The notice describes conditions under which the Department of 
Health and Human Services is required to waive recovery of the 
overpayment, as provided under section 204(b) of the Social Security 
Act; and
    (iii) If the taxpayer files for a waiver under section 204(b) of the 
Social Security Act within the 60-day notice period, the agency has 
considered the taxpayer's request.
    (d) Pre-offset notice and consideration of evidence. (1) For 
purposes of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, an agency has made a 
reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer if the agency uses the most 
recent address information obtained from the Service pursuant to section 
6103(m) (2), (4), or (5) of the Code, unless the agency receives clear 
and concise notification from the taxpayer that notices from the agency 
are to be sent to an address different from the address obtained from 
the Service. Clear and concise notification means that the taxpayer has 
provided the

[[Page 279]]

agency with written notification including the taxpayer's name and 
identifying number (as defined in section 6109), the taxpayer's new 
address, and the taxpayer's intent to have agency notices sent to the 
new address.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, if the 
evidence presented by the taxpayer is considered by an agent of the 
agency, or other entities or persons acting on the agency's behalf, the 
taxpayer must be accorded at least 30 days from the date the agent or 
other entity or person determines that all or part of the debt is past-
due and legally enforceable to request review by an officer or employee 
of the agency of any unresolved dispute. The agency must then notify the 
taxpayer of its decision.
    (e) Referral of past-due, legally enforceable debt. A Federal agency 
must refer a past-due, legally enforceable debt to the Service in the 
time and manner prescribed by the Service. The referral must contain--
    (1) The name and identifying number (as defined in section 6109) of 
the taxpayer who is responsible for the debt;
    (2) The amount of such past-due and legally enforceable debt;
    (3) The date on which the debt became past-due;
    (4) The designation of the Federal agency or subagency referring the 
debt; and
    (5) In the case of an OASDI overpayment, a certification by the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services designating whether the amount 
payable to the agency is to be deposited in either the Federal Old-Age 
and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance 
Trust Fund, but not both.
    (f) Correction of referral. If, after referring a past-due, legally 
enforceable debt to the Service as provided by paragraph (e) of this 
section, an agency determines that an error has been made with respect 
to the information transmitted to the Service, or if an agency receives 
a payment or credits a payment to the account of a taxpayer referred to 
the Service for offset, the agency shall promptly notify the Service. 
The Service shall make the appropriate correction of its records. 
However, this paragraph (f) does not permit an agency to increase the 
amount of a past-due, legally enforceable debt or refer additional 
debtors to the Service for offset after an agency makes its original 
referral of debts for tax refund offset. The agency may refer additional 
debts to the Service for refund offset in subsequent tax refund offset 
years.
    (g) Priorities for offset. (1) An overpayment shall be reduced first 
by the amount of an outstanding liability for any tax under section 
6402(a); second, by the amount of any past-due support assigned to a 
State under section 402(a)(26) or section 471(a)(17) of the Social 
Security Act which is to be offset under section 6402(c) and the 
regulations thereunder; third, by the amount of any past-due, legally 
enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency under section 6402(d) and this 
section; and fourth, by the amount of any qualifying past-due support 
not assigned to a State which is to be offset under section 6402(c) and 
the regulations thereunder.
    (2) If a taxpayer owes more than one past-due, legally enforceable 
debt to a Federal agency or agencies, the overpayment shall be credited 
against the debts in the order in which the debts accrued. A debt shall 
be considered to have accrued at the time at which the agency determines 
that the debt became past due.
    (3) Reduction of the overpayment pursuant to section 6402 (a), (c), 
and (d) shall occur prior to crediting the overpayment to any future 
liability for an internal revenue tax. Any amount remaining after offset 
under section 6402 (a), (c), and (d) shall be refunded to the taxpayer, 
or applied to estimated tax, if elected by the taxpayer.
    (h) Post-offset notice to the taxpayer and the agency. (1) The 
Service shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the amount and date of 
the offset for a past-due, legally enforceable debt and of the Federal 
agency to which this amount has been paid or credited. For joint 
returns, see paragraph (i) of this section.
    (2) The Service shall advise each agency of the names, mailing 
addresses, and identifying numbers of the taxpayers from whom amounts of 
past-due, legally enforceable debt were collected and of the amounts 
collected

[[Page 280]]

from each taxpayer. If the refund from which an amount of past-due, 
legally enforceable debt is to be withheld is based upon a joint return, 
the Service shall notify the agency and furnish the names and addresses 
of each taxpayer filing the joint return.
    (i) Offset made with regard to refund based upon joint return. (1) 
In the case of an offset from a refund based on a joint return, the 
Service shall issue a notice in writing to any person who may have filed 
a joint return with the taxpayer, including the amount and date of any 
offset and the steps which the non-debtor spouse may take in order to 
secure his or her proper share of the refund (unless the non-debtor 
spouse has already taken these steps prior to offset).
    (2) If the person filing the joint return with the taxpayer owing 
the past-due, legally enforceable debt takes appropriate action to 
secure his or her proper share of a refund from which an offset was 
made, the Service shall pay the person his or her share of the refund 
and shall deduct that amount from amounts payable to the agency.
    (j) Disposition of amounts collected. Amounts collected under this 
section shall be transferred to a special account maintained by the 
Financial Management Service (FMS) for each Federal agency. If an 
erroneous payment is made to any agency, the Service shall deduct the 
amount of such payment from amounts payable to the agency.
    (k) Fees. The agency shall enter into a separate agreement with the 
Service and FMS to reimburse the Service and FMS for the full cost of 
administering the tax refund offset program. The fees shall be deducted 
from amounts collected prior to disposition. The fees shall be deposited 
in the United States Treasury and credited to the appropriation accounts 
which bore all or part of the costs involved in administering the refund 
offset procedures.
    (l) Review of offset of refunds. Any reduction of a taxpayer's 
refund made pursuant to section 6402(c) or (d) shall not be subject to 
review by any court of the United States or by the Service in an 
administrative proceeding. No action brought against the United States 
to recover the amount of this reduction shall be considered to be a suit 
for refund of tax. Any legal, equitable, or administrative action by any 
person seeking to recover the amount of the reduction of the overpayment 
must be taken against the Federal agency to which the amount of the 
reduction was paid. Any action which is otherwise available with respect 
to recoveries of overpayments of benefits under section 204 of the 
Social Security Act must be taken against the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services.
    (m) Access to and use of confidential tax information. Access to and 
use of confidential tax information in connection with the tax refund 
offset program are restricted by section 6103 of the Code. However, 
section 6103(l)(10) permits Federal officers and employees of agencies 
participating in the tax refund offset program to have access to and use 
of confidential tax information. Agencies receiving such information are 
subject to the safeguard, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of 
section 6103(p)(4) and the regulations thereunder. The agency shall 
inform its officers and employees who access or use confidential tax 
information of the restrictions and penalties under the Internal Revenue 
Code for misuse of confidential tax information.
    (n) Effective date. This section applies to refunds payable under 
section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code after April 15, 1992.

Sec. 301.6402-7  Claims for refund and applications for tentative carryback adjustments involving consolidated groups that include insolvent financial 
          institutions.

    (a) In general--(1) Overview. Section 6402(i) authorizes the 
Secretary to issue regulations providing for the payment of a refund 
directly to the statutory or court-appointed fiduciary of an insolvent 
corporation that was a subsidiary in a consolidated group, to the extent 
the Secretary determines that the refund is attributable to losses or 
credits of the insolvent corporation. This section provides rules for 
the payment of refunds and tentative carryback adjustments to the 
fiduciary of an insolvent financial institution

[[Page 281]]

that was a subsidiary in a consolidated group.
    (2) Notice. This section provides notice to the common parent of a 
consolidated group of which an insolvent financial institution is or was 
a member that--
    (i) The fiduciary for the institution may, in addition to the common 
parent, act as agent for the group in certain matters relating to the 
tax liability of the group in the year in which a loss arose and for the 
year to which a claim for refund or application for tentative carryback 
adjustment relates; and
    (ii) The Internal Revenue Service may deal directly with the common 
parent or the fiduciary (or both) as agent for the group to the extent 
provided in this section.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms 
have the meanings set forth below:
    (1) Carryback year group. A carryback year group is a consolidated 
group of which a corporation that is or becomes an insolvent financial 
institution is a member during a consolidated carryback year.
    (2) Consolidated carryback year. A consolidated carryback year is a 
consolidated return year to which a loss arising in a loss year is 
carried back.
    (3) Fiduciary. A fiduciary is--
    (i) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
    (ii) The Resolution Trust Corporation; or
    (iii) Any other entity established by federal law, or a federal 
agency, that is identified by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling or 
revenue procedure as a fiduciary for purposes of this section;

in its capacity as an authorized receiver or conservator of an insolvent 
financial institution.
    (4) Insolvent financial institution. An insolvent financial 
institution (an institution) is a bank or domestic building and loan 
association for which the fiduciary is authorized to act as a receiver 
or conservator--
    (i) On the ground that the institution is insolvent within the 
meaning of 12 U.S.C. 191, 12 U.S.C. 1821(c)(5)(A), 12 U.S.C. 
1464(d)(2)(A)(i), or 12 U.S.C. 1464(d)(2)(C)(i) or any applicable state 
law (or any successor statute which adopts a substantially similar 
standard); or
    (ii) On grounds other than insolvency, provided that the institution 
is insolvent within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section 
at any time after commencement of the conservatorship or receivership.

A reference to an institution under these regulations includes, as the 
context requires, a reference to predecessors and successors of the 
institution.
    (5) Loss year. A loss year is a taxable year for which any member or 
former member of the carryback year group claims a loss that may be 
carried back.
    (6) Loss year group. A loss year group is a consolidated group of 
which a corporation that is or becomes an insolvent financial 
institution is a member during a loss year.
    (7) Procedure effective date. The procedure effective date is the

for all Internal Revenue Service Centers to have access to information 
indicating that--
    (i) Appropriate notice to the Internal Revenue Service has been 
filed; and
    (ii) Payments with respect to losses of an institution are to be 
paid in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
    (8) Definitions in Sec. 1.1502-1. Unless otherwise provided, the 
definitions contained in Sec. 1.1502-1 of this chapter apply in this 
section.
    (c) Deemed agency status of fiduciary--(1) In general. 
Notwithstanding the general treatment of a common parent as the agent of 
a group under Secs. 1.1502-77 and 1.1502-78 of this chapter, if the 
fiduciary satisfies the notice requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, the fiduciary may also be deemed to be an agent under 
Secs. 1.1502-77 and 1.1502-78 of this chapter--
    (i) Of the loss year group (if any) for purposes of filing a 
consolidated return for the loss year;
    (ii) Of the carryback year group for purposes of filing a claim for 
refund or an application for a tentative carryback adjustment for the 
consolidated carryback year under paragraph

[[Page 282]]

(e) of this section and receiving payments of any refund or tentative 
carryback adjustment under paragraph (g) of this section; and
    (iii) Of the carryback year group, the loss year group or any other 
group of which the institution is a member for any matter pertaining to 
the determination of the refund or tentative carryback adjustment, but 
only to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Limitation. The fiduciary may act as an agent for matters 
described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section only to the extent--
    (i) Authorized by the district director, in his/her sole discretion, 
after receiving a written request from the fiduciary; or
    (ii) Requested by the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section.
    (d) Notice requirements--(1) Notice to the Internal Revenue Service. 
To satisfy the notice requirement of this paragraph (d)(1), the 
fiduciary must file Form 56-F, Notice Concerning Fiduciary Relationship 
of Financial Institution, with the Internal Revenue Service Center 
indicated on the form. However, in its sole discretion, the Internal 
Revenue Service may treat notice to it in any other manner as satisfying 
the notice requirement under this paragraph (d)(1).
    (2) Notice to the common parent--(i) Form 56-F. The fiduciary must 
send a copy of the form 56-F filed with the Internal Revenue Service 
Center or any other notice provided to the Service under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section to the common parent of the loss year group (if 
any) and the common parent of all carryback year groups (if different 
from the loss year group).
    (ii) Claim for refund and loss year return. If a claim for refund is 
filed by the fiduciary in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, the fiduciary must provide a copy of the claim for refund to 
the common parent of the carryback year group. If a loss year return is 
filed by the fiduciary in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, the fiduciary must provide a copy of the loss year return to 
the common parent of the loss year group (if any).
    (iii) Additional information. The fiduciary must provide to the 
affected common parent a copy of the request for agency status referred 
to in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, and a copy of any 
additional information submitted to the Internal Revenue Service as 
agent under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (e) Filing requirements of the fiduciary--(1) Claim for refund by 
the fiduciary. If the fiduciary accepts a claim for refund filed by the 
common parent, the fiduciary may claim a refund under this section by 
filing a copy of the common parent's claim for refund. If no claim for 
refund is filed by the common parent for the consolidated carryback year 
or the fiduciary does not accept a claim for refund filed by the common 
parent, the fiduciary may claim a refund under this section by filing 
its own claim for refund under section 6402, based on all information 
pertaining to the institution and all information pertaining to other 
members of the carryback year group and the loss year group to which the 
fiduciary has reasonable access. Any claim for refund filed by the 
fiduciary under this paragraph (e)(1) must contain the title ``Claim for 
refund under section 6402(i) of the Code'' at the top of the first page 
of the claim, and the following must be attached to the claim:
    (i) The name and employer identification number of the institution 
that was a member of the carryback year group;
    (ii) The name of the fiduciary;
    (iii) A schedule demonstrating that the amount of the refund claimed 
by the fiduciary is determined in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section;
    (iv) A representation that the institution is an insolvent financial 
institution as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section;
    (v) A representation that the fiduciary has satisfied the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section; 
and
    (vi) A statement executed by an authorized representative of the 
fiduciary and any paid preparer utilized by the fiduciary that provides 
``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined the items 
listed in Sec. 301.6402-

[[Page 283]]

7T(e)(1)(i) through (v), including accompanying schedules and 
statements, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, 
correct, and complete. Declaration of preparer (other than fiduciary) is 
based on all information of which the preparer has any knowledge.''
    (2) Application for tentative carryback adjustment pursuant to 
section 6411. Notwithstanding section 6411 and Sec. 1.1502-78 of this 
chapter, an application for a tentative carryback adjustment must be 
signed by both the common parent of the carryback year group and the 
fiduciary if the payment with respect to the tentative carryback 
adjustment is not made before the procedure effective date (whether or 
not the application was filed before the procedure effective date). Any 
application for a tentative carryback adjustment filed under this 
paragraph (e)(2) must contain the title ``Application for tentative 
carryback adjustment under section 6402(i) of the Code'' at the top of 
the first page of the application. In addition, the following must be 
attached to the application:
    (i) The name and employer identification number of the institution 
that was a member of the carryback year group;
    (ii) The name of the fiduciary;
    (iii) A schedule demonstrating that the amount claimed by the 
fiduciary is determined in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section;
    (iv) A representation that the institution is an insolvent financial 
institution as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and
    (v) A representation that the fiduciary has satisfied the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Loss year return by the fiduciary. If the institution is a 
member of a loss year group, and either the common parent does not file 
a loss year return or the fiduciary does not accept the loss year return 
filed by the common parent, the fiduciary may file a loss year return 
with respect to the loss year group. A loss year return can only be 
filed by the fiduciary in conjunction with the filing of a claim for 
refund under paragraph (e)(1).The return must be based on all 
information pertaining to the institution and all information pertaining 
to other members to which the fiduciary has reasonable access. Any 
return filed by the fiduciary under this paragraph (e)(3) must contain 
the title ``Loss year return under section 6402(i) of the Code'' at the 
top of the first page of the return, and the following must be attached 
to the return:
    (i) The name and employer identification number of the institution 
that is a member of the loss year group;
    (ii) The name of the fiduciary;
    (iii) A representation that the institution is an insolvent 
financial institution as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; 
and
    (iv) A representation that the fiduciary has satisfied the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (4) Additional information. If the fiduciary files additional 
information under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the fiduciary 
must attach a representation that it has satisfied the requirements set 
forth in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (5) Election to waiver carryback. Any election filed after December 
30, 1991, by the common parent of a loss year group under section 
172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a 
consolidated net operating loss arising in a loss year is not effective 
with respect to the portion of the consolidated net operating loss 
attributable to a subsidiary that is an institution. Instead, the 
fiduciary may make the election under section 172(b)(3) with respect to 
the portion attributable to the institution after the notice described 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is filed. For purposes of this 
paragraph (e)(5), the portion attributable to an institution is 
determined under the principles of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (f) Processing and reconciliation of information by the Internal 
Revenue Service--(1) Loss year return if the insolvent financial 
institution is a member of a loss year group. The Internal Revenue 
Service may, in its sole discretion, adjust a loss year return filed by 
the common parent of a loss year group to take into account information 
filed by the fiduciary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, 
or accept or adjust a loss year return for the loss year group

[[Page 284]]

filed by the fiduciary. Nothing in this section relieves the common 
parent of a loss year group of its duty to file a consolidated return 
taking into account an institution's items of income, gain, loss, 
deduction, and credit for any taxable year, or obligates the Internal 
Revenue Service to accept a return filed by the fiduciary as the return 
of the loss year group.
    (2) Claim for refund with respect to consolidated carryback year. 
The Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, adjust a claim 
for refund filed by the common parent of a carryback year group to take 
into account information filed by the fiduciary in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section, or accept or adjust a claim for refund 
for the carryback year group filed by the fiduciary. Nothing in this 
section obligates the Internal Revenue Service to pay a claim for 
refund, or to accept a claim for refund, filed by the fiduciary as a 
claim for refund for the carryback year group.
    (3) Additional information. In determining the amount of any refund 
that may be paid to the fiduciary under paragraph (g) of this section, 
the Internal Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, take into 
account any information that the Internal Revenue Service deems relevant 
and may require the fiduciary to file any additional information the 
Internal Revenue Service deems appropriate.
    (g) Payment of a refund or a tentative carryback adjustment to 
fiduciary--(1) In general. If a claim for refund or an application for a 
tentative carryback adjustment is filed for the consolidated carryback 
year in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the Internal 
Revenue Service may, in its sole discretion, pay to the fiduciary all or 
any portion of the refund or tentative carryback adjustment that the 
Internal Revenue Service determines under this section to be 
attributable to the net operating losses of the institution. Nothing in 
this section obligates the Internal Revenue Service to pay to the 
fiduciary all or any portion of a claim for refund or application for 
tentative carryback adjustment.
    (2) Portion of refund or tentative carryback adjustment attributable 
to the net operating loss of an insolvent financial institution--(i) In 
general. The portion of a refund or tentative carryback adjustment 
attributable to a net operating loss of an institution that is carried 
to a consolidated carryback year is determined based on the absorption, 
as described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, of the 
institution's net operating loss carried to the consolidated carryback 
year.
    (ii) Member's net operating loss. If the loss year is a consolidated 
return year, references in this section to the net operating loss of a 
member of the loss year group is a reference to the portion of the loss 
year group's consolidated net operating loss attributable to the member. 
The consolidated net operating loss for a taxable year that is 
attributable to a member is determined by a fraction, the numerator of 
which is the separate net operating loss of the member for the year of 
the loss and the denominator of which is the sum of the separate net 
operating losses for that year of all members having such losses. For 
this purpose, the separate net operating loss of a member is determined 
by computing the consolidated net operating loss by taking into account 
only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss, including 
the member's losses and deductions actually absorbed by the group in the 
taxable year (whether or not absorbed by the member).
    (iii) Absorption of net operating losses. The absorption of net 
operating losses generally is determined under applicable principles of 
the Code and regulations, including the principles of section 172 and 
Secs. 1.1502-21T (b) or 1.1502-21A (b) (as appropriate) of this chapter. 
Notwithstanding any contrary rule or principle of the Code or 
regulations, if an institution and another member of the carryback year 
group have net operating losses that arise in taxable years ending on 
the same date and are carried to the same consolidated carryback year, 
the carryback year group's consolidated taxable income for that year is 
treated as offset first by the loss attributable to the institution to 
the extent thereof.
    (3) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, all 
groups file consolidated returns, all corporations have calendar taxable 
years, the facts

[[Page 285]]

set forth the only corporate activity, the fiduciary has met the notice 
and filing requirements of this section, and the common parent has filed 
a return for the loss year and a claim for refund. The principles of 
this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Absorption of net operating losses. (a) P owns all the 
stock of S1, an insolvent financial institution, and S2, a corporation 
that is not a financial institution. For Year 1, P, S1, and S2 each have 
$50 of income, and the P group's consolidated taxable income is $150. On 
May 31 of Year 2, S1 becomes insolvent and is placed in receivership 
under the supervision of a fiduciary. For Year 2, the P group has a 
consolidated net operating loss of $200, of which $100 is attributable 
to S1 and $100 is attributable to S2.
    (b) Under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the $150 of 
consolidated taxable income for Year 1 is offset first by the $100 
portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 attributable 
to S1. The remaining $50 is treated as offset by $50 of the $100 of 
consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2. Thus, the refund 
attributable to $100 of the loss may be payable to the fiduciary and the 
refund attributable to $50 of the loss may be payable to P. The 
remaining $50 consolidated net operating loss, available to be carried 
forward, is entirely attributable to S2.
    Example 2. Separate return net operating loss. The facts are the 
same as in Example 1, except that S1 left the P group at the end of Year 
1 and its $100 of loss in Year 2 is incurred in a separate return 
limitation year. Under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the 
generally applicable absorption principles of section 172 and 
Sec. 1.1502-21T of this chapter apply. Although S1 and S2 are carrying 
back losses to Year 1 from taxable years ending on the same date (Year 
2), S1's loss is subject to a $50 limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21T (c) 
of this chapter and only $50 of S1's loss is absorbed before S2's net 
operating loss. Therefore, the refund attributable to $50 of the net 
operating loss of S1 may be payable to the fiduciary, and the refund 
attributable to $100 of the net operating loss of S2 may be payable to 
P. The remaining $50 net operating loss of S1 is available to be carried 
forward.

    (4) Refund or tentative carryback adjustment allocation agreement. 
The determination of the portion of any refund or tentative carryback 
adjustment payable to the fiduciary under this paragraph (g) shall be 
made without regard to--
    (i) Any agreement among the members of the consolidated group; or
    (ii) Whether the fiduciary is otherwise entitled to any portion of 
the refund or tentative carryback adjustment under applicable law.
    (h) Credits, net capital losses, and subgroups--(1) Credits and net 
capital losses--(i) In general. The principles of this section also 
apply to credits and net capital losses, with appropriate adjustments to 
reflect differences between the rules applicable to net operating losses 
and those applicable to credits and net capital losses.
    (ii) Example. The principles of this paragraph (h)(1) are 
illustrated by the following example.

    Example. Net capital loss. (a) P owns all the stock of S1, an 
insolvent financial institution, and S2, a corporation that is not a 
financial institution. For Year 1, P, S1, and S2 each have $50 of 
capital gain, and the P group's consolidated capital gain net income is 
$150. On May 31 of Year 2, S1 becomes insolvent and is placed in 
receivership under the supervision of a fiduciary. For Year 2, the P 
group has a consolidated net operating loss of $100 that is attributable 
to S1, and a consolidated net capital loss of $100 that is attributable 
to S2.
    (b) Under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) and (h)(1) of this section, the 
generally applicable absorption principles of sections 172 and 1212 and 
Secs. 1.1502-21T (b) and 1.1502-22T (b) of this chapter apply. 
Consequently, S2's capital loss is absorbed before S1's net operating 
loss. Therefore, the $150 of consolidated capital gain net income is 
offset first by S2's $100 capital loss and the remaining $50 by S1's net 
operating loss. The refund attributable to $50 of the net operating loss 
may be payable to the fiduciary, and the refund attributable to the $100 
of capital loss may be payable to P. The remaining $50 consolidated net 
operating loss available to be carried forward is entirely attributable 
to S1.

    (2) Insolvent financial institution subgroup--(i) In general. The 
principles of this section apply to all members included in an insolvent 
financial institution subgroup with appropriate adjustments to reflect 
differences resulting from the application to more than one corporation 
in a group. Unless otherwise determined by the Internal Revenue Service 
in its sole discretion, an insolvent financial institution subgroup is 
composed of an insolvent financial institution and those other members 
of a loss year group that, at any time during the conservatorship or 
receivership of the institution, bear the

[[Page 286]]

same relationship to the institution that the members of a group bear to 
their common parent under section 1504(a)(1).
    (ii) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (h)(2) are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Loss of other subgroup members. (a) S1 is a financial 
institution, and P, S2, and S3 are not financial institutions. P owns 
all the stock of S1, S1 owns all the stock of S2, and the stock of S3 is 
owned 20 percent by S2 and 80 percent by P. For Year 1, P, S1, and S2 
each have $100 of income, S3 has no income or loss, and the P group's 
consolidated taxable income is $300. On May 31 of Year 2, S1 becomes 
insolvent and is placed in receivership under the supervision of a 
fiduciary. For Year 2, the P group has a consolidated net operating loss 
of $300, of which $200 is attributable to S1 and $100 is attributable to 
S2.
    (b) S1 and S2 compose a subgroup because S2 bears the same 
relationship to S1 that the member of a group bears to its common parent 
under section 1504(a). S3 is not included in the subgroup because it is 
not connected to S1 through 80 percent stock ownership as described in 
section 1504(a).
    (c) Because S1 and S2 are members of a subgroup, a claim for refund 
under paragraph (e) of this section must be based on the aggregate 
consolidated net operating loss of both S1 and S2. Under paragraph 
(e)(5) of this section, P may not elect under section 172(b)(3) to 
relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to the $300 of 
consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 2 that is attributable 
to S1 and S2. Any refund payable under paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
with respect to the $300 loss of S1 and S2 may be paid by the Internal 
Revenue Service directly to the fiduciary.
    Example 2. Income of other subgroup members. (a) The facts are the 
same as in Example 1, except that S2 has $100 of income in Year 2 rather 
than $100 of loss. Any refund payable under paragraph (g) of this 
section with respect to the loss of S1 in Year 2 must take into account 
the income of S2, and therefore the refund will be based on a $100 loss 
of the subgroup.
    (b) Although P and S3 are not members included in the subgroup, the 
loss year return and the claim for refund filed by the fiduciary under 
paragraph (e) of this section must be completed based on all information 
to which the fiduciary has reasonable access. Under paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section, if P does not file a loss year return that is accepted by 
S1, and S1 has reasonable access to information indicating that P and S3 
have income in Year 2, S1 must take that income into account in filing 
the P group's return for Year 2 and reduce the amount of S1's loss that 
may be carried to Year 1 accordingly. However, if P or S3 has a loss in 
Year 2, any refund attributable to that loss will not be paid to the 
fiduciary.

    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Determination of ownership. This section determines the party to 
whom a refund or tentative carryback adjustment will be paid but is not 
determinative of ownership of any such amount among current or former 
members of a consolidated group (including the institution).
    (k) Liability of the Government. Any refund or tentative carryback 
adjustment paid to the fiduciary discharges any liability of the 
Government to the same extent as payment to the common parent under 
Sec. 1.1502-77 or Sec. 1.1502-78 of this chapter. Furthermore, any 
refund or tentative carryback adjustment paid to the fiduciary is 
considered a payment to all members of the carryback year group. Any 
determination made by the Internal Revenue Service under this section to 
pay a refund or tentative carryback adjustment to a fiduciary or the 
common parent may not be challenged by the common parent, any member of 
the group, or the fiduciary.
    (l) Effective dates. This section applies to refunds and tentative 
carryback adjustments paid after December 30, 1991.

Sec. 301.6404-1   Abatements.

    (a) The district director or the director of the regional service 
center may abate any assessment, or unpaid portion thereof, if the 
assessment is in excess of the correct tax liability, if the assessment 
is made subsequent to the expiration of the period of limitations 
applicable thereto, or if the assessment has been erroneously or 
illegally made.
    (b) No claim for abatement may be filed with respect to income, 
estate, or gift tax.
    (c) Except in case of income, estate, or gift tax, if more than the 
correct amount of tax, interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, 
or assessable penalty is assessed but not paid to the district director, 
the person against whom the assessment is made may file a claim for 
abatement of such overassessment. Each claim for abatement under this 
section shall be made on Form 843. In the case of a claim filed prior to 
April 15, 1968, the claim shall be filed in the office of the internal 
revenue officer by whom the tax was assessed or with the assistant 
regional Commissioner (alcohol, tobacco, and firearms) where the 
regulations respecting the particular tax to which the claim relates 
specifically require the claim to be filed with that officer. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried 
documents), in the case of a claim filed after April 14, 1968, the claim 
shall be filed (1) with the Director of International Operations if the 
tax was assessed by him, or (2) with the assistant regional Commissioner 
(alcohol, tobacco, and firearms) where the regulations respecting the 
particular tax to which the claim relates specifically require the claim 
to be filed with that officer; otherwise, the claim shall be filed with 
the service center serving the internal revenue district in which the 
tax was assessed. Form 843 shall be made in accordance with the 
instructions relating to such form.
    (d) The Commissioner may issue uniform instructions to district 
directors authorizing them, to the extent permitted in such 
instructions, to abate amounts the collection of which is not warranted 
because of the administration and collection costs.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6404-2T  Definition of ministerial act (temporary).

    (a) In general. Section 6404(e)(1) provides that the Commissioner 
may (in his or her discretion) abate the assessment of all or any part 
of interest on--
    (1) Any deficiency (as defined in section 6211(a), relating to 
income, estate, gift, generation-skipping, and certain excise taxes) 
attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by an officer or 
employee of the Internal Revenue Service (acting in an official 
capacity) in performing a ministerial act, or
    (2) Any payment of any tax described in section 6212(a) (relating to 
income, estate, gift, generation-skipping, and certain excise taxes) to 
the extent that any delay in such payment is attributable to such an 
officer or employee being dilatory in performing a ministerial act. An 
error or delay in performing a ministerial act shall be taken into 
account only if no significant aspect of such error or delay can be 
attributed to the taxpayer involved or to a person related to the 
taxpayer within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1). 
Moreover, an error or delay in performing a ministerial act shall be 
taken into account only if it occurs

[[Page 288]]

after the Service has contacted the taxpayer in writing with respect to 
the deficiency or payment.
    (b) Ministerial act--(1) Definition. The term ``ministerial act'' 
means a procedural or mechanical act that does not involve the exercise 
of judgment or discretion, and that occurs during the processing of a 
taxpayer's case after all prerequisites to the act, such as conferences 
and review by supervisors, have taken place. A decision concerning the 
proper application of federal tax law (or other federal or state law) is 
not a ministerial act.
    (2) Examples. The definition of ministerial act may be illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. A taxpayer moves from one state to another before the 
Internal Revenue Service selects the taxpayer's income tax return for 
examination. A letter explaining that the return has been selected for 
examination is sent to the taxpayer's old address and then forwarded to 
the new address. The taxpayer timely responds, asking that the audit be 
transferred to the Service's district office that is nearest the new 
address. The group manager approves the request. After the request for 
transfer has been approved, the transfer of the case is a ministerial 
act. The Commissioner may (in his or her discretion) abate interest 
attributable to a delay in transferring the case.
    Example 2. An examination of a taxpayer's income tax return reveals 
a deficiency with respect to which a notice of deficiency will be 
issued. After the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service have 
identified all agreed and unagreed issues, the notice has been prepared 
and reviewed (including review by District Counsel, if necessary) and 
any other relevant prerequisites have been completed, the issuance of 
the notice of deficiency is a ministerial act. The Commissioner may (in 
his or her discretion) abate interest attributable to a delay in issuing 
the notice.
    Example 3. A taxpayer invested in a tax shelter and reported a loss 
from the tax shelter on the taxpayer's income tax return. Internal 
Revenue Service personnel conducted an extensive examination of the tax 
shelter, and the processing of the taxpayer's case was delayed during 
such examination. Because the period of limitations on assessment was 
about to expire, the taxpayer executed a consent to extend the period of 
limitations. The time required to process the taxpayer's case was not a 
result of a delay in performing a ministerial act; consequently, 
interest attributable to this period cannot be abated under paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    Example 4. A revenue agent is sent to a training course, and the 
agent's supervisor decides not to reassign the agent's cases. During the 
training course, no work is done on the cases assigned to the agent. 
Neither the decision to send the agent to the training course nor the 
decision not to reassign the agent's cases is, under the circumstances, 
a ministerial act. Thus, interest attributable to the delay cannot be 
abated.
    Example 5. A taxpayer who claimed a loss from a tax shelter on the 
taxpayer's income tax return is notified that the Internal Revenue 
Service intends to examine the return. However, because of other work 
priorities and resource limitations, a decision is made not to commence 
the examination for an extended period thereafter. The decision not to 
commence the examination involves the exercise of judgment and 
discretion and is not a ministerial act; consequently, interest 
attributable to the period of delay cannot be abated.

    (c) Effective date. The provisions of this section apply to interest 
accruing with respect to deficiencies or payments of tax described in 
section 6212(a) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978. If 
a refund or credit of interest attributable to the application of 
paragraph (a) of this section to a tax liability arising with respect to 
any such taxable year is prevented at any time on or before October 22, 
1987, by the operation of any law or rule of law (including res 
judicata), refund or credit of such interest (to the extent attributable 
to the application of paragraph (a) of this section) may, nevertheless, 
be made or allowed if a claim for such interest is filed on or before 
October 22, 1987.

[T.D. 8150, 52 FR 30163, Aug. 13, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6404-3  Abatement of penalty or addition to tax attributable to erroneous written advice of the Internal Revenue Service.

    (a) General rule. Any portion of any penalty or addition to tax that 
is attributable to erroneous advice furnished to the taxpayer in writing 
by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service (Service), 
acting in his or her official capacity, shall be abated, provided the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met.
    (b) Requirements--(1) In general. Paragraph (a) of this section 
shall apply only if--

[[Page 289]]

    (i) The written advice was reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer;
    (ii) The advice was issued in response to a specific written request 
for advice by the taxpayer; and
    (iii) The taxpayer requesting advice provided adequate and accurate 
information.
    (2) Advice was reasonably relied upon--(i) In general. The written 
advice from the Service must have been reasonably relied upon by the 
taxpayer in order for any penalty to be abated under paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (ii) Advice relating to a tax return. In the case of written advice 
from the Service that relates to an item included on a federal tax 
return of a taxpayer, if such advice is received by the taxpayer 
subsequent to the date on which the taxpayer filed such return, the 
taxpayer shall not be considered to have reasonably relied upon such 
written advice for purposes of this section, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Amended returns. If a taxpayer files an amended federal tax 
return that conforms with written advice received by the taxpayer from 
the Service, the taxpayer will be considered to have reasonably relied 
upon the advice for purposes of the position set forth in the amended 
return.
    (iv) Advice not related to a tax return. In the case of written 
advice that does not relate to an item included on a federal tax return 
(for example, the payment of estimated taxes), if such written advice is 
received by the taxpayer subsequent to the act or omission of the 
taxpayer that is the basis for the penalty or addition of tax, then the 
taxpayer shall not be considered to have reasonably relied upon such 
written advice for purposes of this section.
    (v) Period of reliance. If the written advice received by the 
taxpayer relates to a continuing action or series of actions, the 
taxpayer may rely on that advice until the taxpayer is put on notice 
that the advice is no longer consistent with Service position and, thus, 
no longer valid. For purposes of this section, the taxpayer will be put 
on notice that written advice is no longer valid if the taxpayer 
receives correspondence from the Service stating that the advice no 
longer represents Service position. Further, any of the following 
events, occurring subsequent to the issuance of the advice, that set 
forth a position that is inconsistent with the written advice received 
from the Service shall be deemed to put the taxpayer on notice that the 
advice is no longer valid--
    (A) Enactment of legislation or ratification of a tax treaty;
    (B) A decision of the United States Supreme Court;
    (C) The issuance of temporary or final regulations; or
    (D) The issuance of a revenue ruling, a revenue procedure, or other 
statement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
    (3) Advice was in response to written request. No abatement under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be allowed unless the penalty or 
addition to tax is attributable to advice issued in response to a 
specific written request for advice by the taxpayer. For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, a written request from a representative of the 
taxpayer shall be considered a written request by the taxpayer only if--
    (i) The taxpayer's representative is an attorney, a certified public 
accountant, an enrolled agent, an enrolled actuary, or any other person 
permitted to represent the taxpayer before the Service and who is not 
disbarred or suspended from practice before the Service; and
    (ii) The written request for advice either is accompanied by a power 
of attorney that is signed by the taxpayer and that authorizes the 
representative to represent the taxpayer for purposes of the request, or 
such a power of attorney is currently on file with the Service.
    (4) Taxpayer's information must be adequate and accurate. No 
abatement under paragraph (a) of this section shall be allowed with 
respect to any portion of any penalty or addition to tax that resulted 
because the taxpayer requesting the advice did not provide the Service 
with adequate and accurate information. The Service has no obligation to 
verify or correct the taxpayer's submitted information.

[[Page 290]]

    (c) Definitions--(1) Advice. For purposes of section 6404(f) and the 
regulations thereunder, a written response issued to a taxpayer by an 
officer or employee of the Service shall constitute ``advice'' if, and 
only if, the response applies the tax laws to the specific facts 
submitted in writing by the taxpayer and provides a conclusion regarding 
the tax treatment to be accorded the taxpayer upon the application of 
the tax law to those facts.
    (2) Penalty and addition to tax. For purposes of section 6404(f) and 
the regulations thereunder, the terms ``penalty'' and ``addition to 
tax'' refer to any liability of a particular taxpayer imposed under 
subtitle F, chapter 68, subchapter A and subchapter B of the Internal 
Revenue Code, and the liabilities imposed by sections 6038(b), 6038(c), 
6038A(d), 6038B(b), 6039E(c), and 6332(d)(2). In addition, the terms 
``penalty'' and ``addition to tax'' shall include any liability 
resulting from the application of other provisions of the Code where the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue has designated by regulation, revenue 
ruling, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin 
that such provision shall be considered a penalty or addition to tax for 
purposes of section 6404(f). The terms ``penalty'' and ``addition to 
tax'' shall also include interest imposed with respect to any penalty or 
addition to tax.
    (d) Procedures for abatement. Taxpayers entitled to an abatement of 
a penalty or addition to tax pursuant to section 6404(f) and this 
section should complete and file Form 843. If the erroneous advice 
received relates to an item on a federal tax return, taxpayers should 
submit Form 843 to the Internal Revenue Service Center where the return 
was filed. If the advice does not relate to an item on a federal tax 
return, the taxpayer should submit Form 843 to the Service Center where 
the taxpayer's return was filed for the taxable year in which the 
taxpayer relied on the erroneous advice. At the top of Form 843 
taxpayers should write, ``Abatement of penalty or addition to tax 
pursuant to section 6404(f).'' Further, taxpayers must state on Form 843 
whether the penalty or addition to tax has been paid. Taxpayers must 
submit, with Form 843, copies of the following--
    (1) The taxpayer's written request for advice;
    (2) The erroneous written advice furnished by the Service to the 
taxpayer and relied on by the taxpayer; and
    (3) The report (if any) of tax adjustments that identifies the 
penalty or addition to tax and the item relating to the erroneous 
written advice.
    (e) Period for requesting abatement. An abatement of any penalty or 
addition to tax pursuant to section 6404(f) and this section shall be 
allowed only if the request for abatement described in paragraph (d) of 
this section is submitted within the period allowed for collection of 
such penalty or addition to tax, or, if the penalty or addition to tax 
has been paid, the period allowed for claiming a credit or refund of 
such penalty or addition to tax.
    (f) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
section 6404(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder:

    Example 1. In February 1989, an individual submitted a written 
request for advice to an Internal Revenue Service Center and included 
adequate and accurate information to consider the request. The question 
posed by the taxpayer concerned whether a certain amount was includible 
in income on the taxpayer's 1989 federal income tax return. An employee 
of the Service Center issued the taxpayer a written response that 
concluded that based on the specific facts submitted by the taxpayer, 
the amount was not includible in income on the taxpayer's 1989 return. 
Since the response provided a conclusion regarding the tax treatment 
accorded the taxpayer on the basis of the facts submitted, the response 
constitutes ``advice'' for purposes of section 6404(f). The taxpayer 
filed his 1989 return and, relying on the Service's advice, did not 
include the item in income. Upon examination, it was determined that the 
item should have been included in income on the taxpayer's 1989 return. 
Because the taxpayer reasonably relied upon erroneous written advice 
from the Service, any penalty or addition to tax attributable to the 
erroneous advice will be abated by the Service. However, the erroneous 
advice will not affect the amount of any taxes and interest owed by the 
taxpayer (except to the extent interest relates to a penalty or addition 
to tax attributable to the erroneous advice) due to the fact that the 
item was not included in income.

[[Page 291]]

    Example 2. In March 1989, an individual submitted a written request 
to the National Office of the Internal Revenue Service regarding whether 
a certain activity constitutes a passive activity within the meaning of 
section 469 of the Code. The request did not meet the procedural 
requirements set forth by the National Office for consideration of the 
submission as a private letter ruling request and, thus, was not treated 
as such by the Service. The Service furnished the taxpayer with a 
written response that transmitted various published provisions of 
section 469 and the regulations thereunder relevant to the determination 
of whether an activity is passive within the meaning of those 
provisions. The Service also included a Publication regarding the tax 
treatment of passive activities. However, the Service's response 
contained no opinion or determination regarding whether the taxpayer's 
described activity was or was not passive under section 469. The 
Service's response is not advice within the meaning of section 6404(f), 
and cannot be relied upon for purposes of an abatement of a portion of a 
penalty or addition to tax under that section.
    Example 3. On April 1, 1989, an individual submitted a written 
request for advice to an Internal Revenue Service Center. The advice 
related to an item included on a federal tax return. The individual 
filed a federal income tax return with the appropriate Service Center on 
April 15, 1989. Subsequently, on May 1, 1989, the individual received 
advice from the Service Center concerning the written request made on 
April 1. Because the individual filed his tax return prior to the date 
on which written advice from the Service was received, the individual 
did not rely on the Service's written advice for purposes of section 
6404(f). If, however, the individual amends his tax return to conform 
with the written advice received from the Service, the individual will 
be considered to have reasonably relied upon the Service's advice.
    Example 4. Individual A, on May 1, 1989, received advice from the 
Service that concluded that interest paid by the taxpayer with respect 
to a specific loan was interest paid or accrued in connection with a 
trade or business, within the meaning of section 163(h)(2)(A) of the 
Code. The advice relates to a continuing action. Therefore, provided the 
facts submitted by the taxpayer to obtain the advice remain adequate and 
accurate (that is, the circumstances relating to the indebtedness do not 
change), Individual A may rely on the Service's advice for subsequent 
taxable years until the individual is put on notice that the advice no 
longer represents Service position and, thus, is no longer valid.
    Example 5. An individual, on June 1, 1989, received advice from the 
Service that concluded that no gain or loss would be recognized with 
respect to a transfer of property to his spouse under section 1041. The 
advice does not relate to a continuing action. Therefore, the taxpayer 
may not rely on the advice of the Service for transfers other than the 
transfer discussed in the taxpayer's written request for advice.

    (g) Effective date. Section 6404(f) shall apply with respect to 
advice requested on or after January 1, 1989.

income tax (including any qualified State individual income tax 
collected by the Federal Government), war profits tax, excess profits 
tax, estate tax, or gift tax. An exception is provided under which 
refunds and credits made after July 1, 1972, and attributable to an

return was filed. For rules applicable in cases where the return is 
filed prior to the due date thereof, see section 6501(b). In the case of 
taxes payable by stamp, assessment shall be made at any time after the 
tax became due and before the expiration of 3 years after the date on 
which any part of the tax was paid. For exceptions and additional rules, 
see subsections (b) to (g) of section 6501, and for cross references to 
other provisions relating to limitations on assessment and collection, 
see sections 6501(h) and 6504.
    (b) No proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of 
any tax shall be begun after the expiration of the applicable period for 
the assessment of such tax.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(b)-1   Time return deemed filed for purposes of determining limitations.

    (a) Early return. Any return, other than a return of tax referred to 
in paragraph (b) of this section, filed before the last day prescribed 
by law or regulations for the filing thereof (determined without regard 
to any extension of time for filing) shall be considered as filed on 
such last day.
    (b) Returns of social security tax and of income tax withholding. If 
a return on or after November 13, 1966, of tax imposed by chapter 3 of 
the Code (relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and 
foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds), or if a return of tax 
imposed by chapter 21 of the Code (relating to the Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act) or by chapter 24 of the Code (relating to collection 
of income tax at source on wages), for any period ending with or within 
a calendar year is filed before April 15 of the succeeding calendar 
year, such return shall be deemed filed on April 15 of such succeeding 
calendar year. For example, if quarterly returns of the tax imposed by 
chapter 24 of the Code are filed for the four quarters of 1955 on April 
30, July 31, and October 31, 1955, and on January 31, 1956, the period 
of limitation for assessment with respect to the tax required to be 
reported on such return is measured from April 15, 1956. However, if any 
of such returns is filed after April 15, 1956, the period of limitation 
for assessment of the tax required to be reported on that return is 
measured from the date it is in fact filed.
    (c) Returns executed by district directors or other internal revenue 
officers. The execution of a return by a district director or other 
authorized internal revenue officer or employee under the authority of 
section 6020(b) shall not start the running of the statutory period of 
limitations on assessment and collection.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(c)-1  Exceptions to general period of limitations on assessment and collection.

    (a) False return. In the case of a false or fraudulent return with 
intent to evade any tax, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in 
court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at 
any time after such false or fraudulent return is filed.
    (b) Willful attempt to evade tax. In the case of a willful attempt 
in any manner

[[Page 293]]

to defeat or evade any tax imposed by the Code (other than a tax imposed 
by subtitle A or B, relating to income, estate, or gift taxes), the tax 
may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax 
may be begun without assessment, at any time.
    (c) No return. In the case of a failure to file a return, the tax 
may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax 
may be begun without assessment, at any time after the date prescribed 
for filing the return. For special rules relating to filing a return for 
chapter 42 and similar taxes, see Secs. 301.6501(n)-1, 301.6501(n)-2, 
and 301.6501(n)-3.
    (d) Extension by agreement. The time prescribed by section 6501 for 
the assessment of any tax (other than the estate tax imposed by chapter 
11 of the Code) may, prior to the expiration of such time, be extended 
for any period of time agreed upon in writing by the taxpayer and the 
district director or an assistant regional commissioner. The extension 
shall become effective when the agreement has been executed by both 
parties. The period agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements 
in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed 
upon.
    (e) Certain gifts not shown on return--(1) In general. If any 
transfer of property subject to the special valuation rules of section 
2701 or section 2702, or if the occurrence of any taxable event 
described in section Sec. 25.2701-4 of this chapter, is not adequately 
shown on a return of tax imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the 
Internal Revenue Code (without regard to section 2503(b)), any tax 
imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Code on the transfer or 
resulting from the taxable event may be assessed, or a proceeding in 
court for the collection of the appropriate tax may be begun without 
assessment, at any time.
    (2) Adequately shown. A transfer of property valued under the rules 
of section 2701 or section 2702 or any taxable event described in 
Sec. 25.2701-4 of this chapter will be considered adequately shown on a 
return of tax imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Internal 
Revenue Code only if, with respect to the entire transaction or series 
of transactions (including any transaction that affected the transferred 
interest) of which the transfer (or taxable event) was a part, the 
return provides:
    (i) A description of the transactions, including a description of 
transferred and retained interests and the method (or methods) used to 
value each;
    (ii) The identity of, and relationship between, the transferor, 
transferee, all other persons participating in the transactions, and all 
parties related to the transferor holding an equity interest in any 
entity involved in the transaction; and
    (iii) A detailed description (including all actuarial factors and 
discount rates used) of the method used to determine the amount of the 
gift arising from the transfer (or taxable event), including, in the 
case of an equity interest that is not actively traded, the financial 
and other data used in determining value. Financial data should 
generally include balance sheets and statements of net earnings, 
operating results, and dividends paid for each of the 5 years 
immediately before the valuation date.
    (3) Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph (e) are 
effective as of January 28, 1992. In determining whether a transfer or 
taxable event is adequately shown on a gift tax return filed prior to 
that date, taxpayers may rely on any reasonable interpretation of the 
statutory provisions. For these purposes, the provisions of the proposed 
regulations and the final regulations are considered a reasonable 
interpretation of the statutory provisions.

Sec. 301.6501(d)-1   Request for prompt assessment.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in section 6501 (c), (e), or (f), 
any tax for which a return is required and for which:
    (1) A decedent or an estate of a decedent may be liable, other than 
the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 of the Code, or
    (2) A corporation which is contemplating dissolution, is in the 
process of dissolution, or has been dissolved, may be liable,


[[Page 294]]


shall be assessed, or a proceeding in court without assessment for the 
collection of such tax shall be begun, within 18 months after the 
receipt of a written request for prompt assessment thereof.
    (b) The executor, administrator, or other fiduciary representing the 
estate of the decedent, or the corporation, or the fiduciary 
representing the dissolved corporation, as the case may be, shall, after 
the return in question has been filed, file the request for prompt 
assessment in writing with the district director for the internal 
revenue district in which such return was filed. The request, in order 
to be effective, must be transmitted separately from any other document, 
must set forth the classes of tax and the taxable periods for which the 
prompt assessment is requested, and must clearly indicate that it is a 
request for prompt assessment under the provisions of section 6501(d). 
The effect of such a request is to limit the time in which an assessment 
of tax may be made, or a proceeding in court without assessment for 
collection of tax may be begun, to a period of 18 months from the date 
the request is filed with the proper district director. The request does 
not extend the time within which an assessment may be made, or a 
proceeding in court without assessment years from the date the return 
was filed. This special period of limitations will not apply to any 
return filed after a request for prompt assessment has been made unless 
an additional request is filed in the manner provided herein.
    (c) In the case of a corporation the 18-month period shall not apply 
unless:
    (1) The written request notifies the district director that the 
corporation contemplates dissolution at or before the expiration of such 
18-month period; the dissolution is in good faith begun before the 
expiration of such 18-month period; and the dissolution so begun is 
completed either before or after the expiration of such 18-month period; 
or
    (2) The written request notifies the district director that a 
dissolution has in good faith been begun, and the dissolution is 
completed either before or after the expiration of such 18-month period; 
or
    (3) A dissolution has been completed at the time the written request 
is made.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(e)-1   Omission from return.

    (a) Income taxes--(1) General rule. (i) If the taxpayer omits from 
the gross income stated in the return of a tax imposed by subtitle A of 
the Code an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 
percent of the gross income so stated, the tax may be assessed, or a 
proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without 
assessment, at any time within 6 years after the return was filed.
    (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``gross income'', 
as it relates to a trade or business, means the total of the amounts 
received or accrued from the sale of goods or services, to the extent 
required to be shown on the return, without reduction for the cost of 
such sales or services. An item shall not be considered as omitted from 
gross income if information, sufficient to apprise the district director 
of the nature and amount of such item, is disclosed in the return or in 
any schedule or statement attached to the return.
    (2) Constructive dividends. If a taxpayer omits from gross income an 
amount properly includible therein under section 551(b) as his 
distributive share of the undistributed foreign personal holding company 
income, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the 
collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time 
within 6 years after the return was filed.
    (b) Estate and gift taxes. (1) If the taxpayer omits from the gross 
estate as stated in the estate tax return, or from the total amount of 
the gifts made during the period for which the gift tax return was filed 
(see Sec. 25.6019-1 of this chapter) as stated in such return, an item 
or items properly includible therein the amount of which is in excess of 
25 percent of the gross estate as stated in the return, or 25 percent of 
the total amount of the gifts as stated in the return, the tax may be 
assessed,

[[Page 295]]

or a proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without 
assessment, at any time within 6 years after the return was filed.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph, an item disclosed in the return 
or in any schedule or statement attached to the return in a manner 
sufficient to apprise the district director of the nature and amount 
thereof shall not be taken into account in determining items omitted 
from the gross estate or total gifts, as the case may be. Further, there 
shall not be taken into account in computing the 25 percent omission 
from the gross estate stated in the estate tax return or from the total 
gifts stated in the gift tax return, any increases in the valuation of 
assets disclosed on the return.
    (c) Excise taxes--(1) In general. If the taxpayer omits from a 
return of a tax imposed under a provision of subtitle D an amount 
properly includable thereon, which amount is in excess of 25 percent of 
the amount of tax reported thereon, the tax may be assessed or a 
proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without 
assessment, at any time within 6 years after the return was filed. For 
special rules relating to chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes, see 
subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph.
    (2) Chapter 41 excise taxes. If an organization discloses an 
expenditure in its return (or in a schedule or statement attached 
thereto) in a manner sufficient to apprise the district director or 
director of a service center of the existing and nature of such 
expenditure, the three year limitation on assessment and collection 
described in section 6501(a) shall apply with respect to any tax under 
chapter 41 arising from such expenditure. If a taxpayer fails to so 
disclose an expenditure in its return (or in a schedule or statement 
attached thereto), the tax arising from the expenditure not so disclosed 
may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax 
may be begun without assessment, at any time within 6 years after the 
return was filed.
    (3) Chapter 42 excise taxes. (i) If a private foundation omits from 
its annual return with respect to the tax imposed by section 4940 an 
amount of tax properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 
percent of the amount of tax imposed by section 4940 which is reported 
on the return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the 
collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time 
within 6 years after the return was filed. If a private foundation 
discloses in its return (or in a schedule or statement attached thereto) 
the nature, source, and amount of any income giving rise to any omitted 
tax, the tax arising from such income shall be counted as reported on 
the return in computing whether the foundation has omitted more than 25 
percent of the tax reported on its return.
    (ii) If a private foundation or trust (as the case may be) discloses 
an item in its return (or in a schedule or statement attached thereto) 
in a manner sufficient to apprise the district director or director of a 
service center of the existence and nature of such item, the three year 
limitation on assessment and collection described in section 6501(a) 
shall apply with respect to any tax imposed under sections 4941(a), 
4942(a), 4943(a), 4944(a), 4945(a), 4951(a), 4952(a), and 4953 arising 
from any transaction disclosed by such item. If a private foundation or 
trust (as the case may be) fails to so disclose an item in its return 
(or in a schedule or statement attached thereto), the tax arising from 
any transaction not so disclosed may be assessed or a proceeding in 
court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at 
any time within 6 years after the return was filed.
    (4) Chapter 43 excise taxes. If a taxpayer discloses an item in its 
return (or in a schedule or statement attached thereto) in a manner 
sufficient to apprise the district director or director of a service 
center of the existence and nature of such item, the three year 
limitation on assessment and collection described in section 6501(a) 
shall apply with respect to any tax imposed under sections 4971(a), 
4972, 4973, 4974, and 4975(a) arising from any transaction disclosed by 
such item. If a taxpayer fails to so disclose an item in its return (or 
in a schedule or statement attached thereto), the tax arising from any 
transaction not so disclosed may be assessed, or a proceeding in court

[[Page 296]]

for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any 
time within 6 years after the return was filed. The applicable return 
for the tax under sections 4971, 4972, 4973 and 4974 is the return 
designated by the Commissioner for reporting the respective tax. The 
applicable return for the tax under section 4975 is the return filed by 
the plan used to report the act giving rise to the tax.
    (5) Chapter 44 excise taxes. If a real estate investment trust omits 
from its annual return with respect to the tax imposed by section 4981 
an amount of tax properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 
percent of the amount of tax imposed by section 4981 which is reported 
on the return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the 
collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time 
within 6 years after the return was filed. If a real estate investment 
trust discloses in its return (or in a schedule or statement attached 
thereto) the nature, source, and amount of any income giving rise to any 
omitted tax, the tax arising from such income shall be counted as 
reported on the return in computing whether the trust has omitted more 
than 25 percent of the tax reported on its return.
    (d) Exception. The provisions of this section do not limit the 
application of section 6501(c).

Sec. 301.6501(f)-1   Personal holding company tax.

    If a corporation which is a personal holding company for any taxable 
year fails to file with its income tax return for such year a schedule 
setting forth the items of gross income described in section 543(a) 
received by the corporation during such year, and the names and 
addresses of the individuals who owned, within the meaning of section 
544, at any time during the last half of such taxable year, more than 50 
percent in value of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation, 
the personal holding company tax for such year may be assessed, or a 
proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without 
assessment, at any time within 6 years after the return for such year 
was filed.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(g)-1   Certain income tax returns of corporations.

    (a) Trusts or partnerships. If a taxpayer determines in good faith 
that it is a trust or partnership and files a return as such under 
subtitle A of the Code, and if the taxpayer is later held to be a 
corporation for the taxable year for which the return was filed, such 
return shall be deemed to be the return of the corporation for the 
purpose of section 6501.
    (b) Exempt organizations. If a taxpayer determines in good faith 
that it is an exempt organization and files a return as such under 
section 6033, and if the taxpayer is later held to be a taxable 
organization for the taxable year for which the return was filed, such 
return shall be deemed to be the return of the organization for the 
purpose of section 6501.
    (c) DISC. If a corporation determines in good faith that it is a 
DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1)) for a taxable year and files a 
return as such pursuant to section 6011(c)(2), and if the corporation is 
thereafter held to be a corporation which is not a DISC for the taxable 
year for which the return was filed, then--
    (1) Such return shall be deemed to be the return of the corporation 
for the purpose of section 6501.
    (2) Such return if filed within the time required by section 6072(b) 
for filing a DISC return shall be deemed to be filed within the time 
required by section 6072(b) for filing of a return by a corporation 
which is not a DISC, and
    (3) Interest on underpayment and overpayments allowed by chapter 67 
of the Code and additions to the tax, additional amounts and assessable 
penalties allowed by Chapter 68 of the Code, when determined by 
reference to the time for filing of a return, shall be determined by 
reference to the time required by section 6072(b) for filing of a return 
by a DISC.

Sec. 301.6501(h)-1   Net operating loss or capital loss carrybacks.

    In the case of a deficiency attributable to the application to the 
taxpayer of a net operating loss or capital loss carryback (including 
deficiencies which may be assessed pursuant to the provisions of section 
6213(b)(2)), such deficiency may be assessed at any time before the 
expiration of the period within which a deficiency for the taxable year 
of the net operating loss or net capital loss which results in such 
carryback may be assessed. In the case of a deficiency attributable to 
the application of a net operating loss carryback, such deficiency may 
be assessed within 18 months after the date on which the taxpayer files 
in accordance with section 172(b)(3) a copy of the certification (with 
respect to such taxable year) issued under section 317 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, if later than the date prescribed by the

    With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, a 
deficiency attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a 
carryback under section 904(d) (relating to carryback and carryover of 
excess foreign taxes), may be assessed at any time before the expiration 
of 1 year after the expiration of the period within which a deficiency 
may be assessed for the taxable year of the excess taxes described in 
section 904(d) which result in such carryback.

Sec. 301.6501(j)-1   Investment credit carryback; taxable years ending after December 31, 1961.

    With respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1961, a 
deficiency attributable to the application to the taxpayer of an 
investment credit carryback may be assessed at any time before the 
expiration of the period within which a deficiency for the taxable year 
of the unused investment credit which results in such carryback may be 
assessed, or, with respect to any portion of an investment credit 
carryback from a taxable year attributable to a net operating loss or 
capital loss carryback from a subsequent taxable year, at any time 
before the expiration of the period within which a deficiency for such 
subsequent taxable year may be assessed. For purposes of this section a 
deficiency shall include a deficiency which may be assessed pursuant to 
the provisions of section 6213(b)(2), but only those arising with 
respect to applications for tentative carryback adjustments filed after 
November 2, 1966.

[T.D. 7301, 39 FR 975, Jan. 4, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(m)-1   Tentative carryback adjustment assessment period.

    (a) Period of limitation after tentative carryback adjustment. (1) 
Under section 6501(m), in a case where an amount has been applied, 
credited, or refunded under section 6411, by reason of a net operating 
loss carryback, a capital loss carryback, an investment credit 
carryback, or a work incentive program credit carryback to a prior 
taxable year, the period described in section 6501(a) of the Code for 
assessing a deficiency for such prior taxable year is extended to 
include the period described in section 6501 (h), (j), or (o), whichever 
is applicable; except that the amount which may be assessed solely by 
reason of section 6501(m) may not exceed the amount so applied, 
credited, or refunded under section 6411, reduced by any amount which 
may be assessed solely by reason of section 6501 (h), (j), or (o), as 
the case may be.
    (2) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. Assume that M Corporation, which claims an unused 
investment credit of $50,000 for the calendar year 1968, files an 
application under section 6411 of the Code for an adjustment of its tax 
for 1965, and receives a refund of $50,000 in 1969. In 1971, it is 
determined that the amount of the unused investment credit for 1968 is 
$30,000 rather than $50,000. Moreover, it is determined that M 
Corporation would have owed $40,000 of additional tax for 1965 if it had 
properly reported certain income which it failed to include in its 1965 
return. Assuming that M Corporation filed its 1968 return on March 15, 
1969, and that the 3-year period described in section 6501(a) has not 
been extended, the period prescribed in section 6501(j) for assessing 
the excessive amount refunded, $20,000 (i.e.,

[[Page 298]]

$50,000, original amount refunded less $30,000, correct amount of unused 
investment credit), does not expire until March 15, 1972, and $20,000 
may be assessed on or before such date under section 6501(j). Under 
section 6501(m), M Corporation may be assessed on or before March 15, 
1972, an amount not in excess of $30,000 ($50,000, the amount refunded 
under section 6411, minus $20,000, the amount which may be assessed 
solely by reason of section 6501 (j)).

    (b) Effective date. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
apply only with respect to applications under section 6411 filed after 
November 2, 1966.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(n)-1  Special rules for chapter 42 and similar taxes.

    (a) Return filed by private foundation, plan, or trust. (1) A return 
filed by a private foundation, plan, or trust (as the case may be) with 
respect to any act giving rise to a tax imposed by chapter 42 (other 
than a tax imposed by section 4940), or by section 4975 shall be 
considered, for purposes of section 6501, to be the return of all 
persons required to file a return with respect to any such tax arising 
from such act, notwithstanding that all such persons have not signed the 
return. In the case of a private foundation that files a Form 990-PF (or 
a Form 5227 in the case of a nonexempt foundation described in section 
4947(a)(2)), which contains questions with respect to such taxes, the 
filing of such form by such foundation shall constitute the filing of a 
return with respect to any such act, even though the foundation 
incorrectly answered such questions.
    (2) For purposes of section 4940, the return referred to in this 
section is the return filed by the private foundation for the taxable 
year for which the tax is imposed.
    (b) Failure of private foundation plan, or trust to file. The period 
of limitations on assessment and collection described in section 6501 
does not begin with respect to any person liable for tax under chapter 
42 (other than section 4940) or section 4975 arising from a given act, 
where the private foundation, plan, or trust (as the case may be) has 
not filed its required return that reports such act for the year in 
which the act (or failure to act) giving rise to liability for such tax 
occurred.
    (c) Example. The provision of this section may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. In 1973, D, an individual taxpayer who was a disqualified 
person under the provisions of section 4946(a)(1), participated in an 
act of self-dealing with a private foundation and incurred a tax under 
section 4941(a)(1). On May 15, 1974, the private foundation files a Form 
990-PF and answers all the questions thereon with regard to any acts of 
self-dealing (as defined in section 4941(d)) in which it may have 
engaged in 1973. Assuming that the foundation's return was not a false 
or fraudulent return nor made with the willful attempt to defeat tax, 
the period of limitations on assessment and collection under section 
6501(a) shall start with respect to any tax under section 4941(a) or

Sec. 301.6501(o)-1   Work incentive program credit carrybacks, taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971.

    With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, a 
deficiency attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a work 
incentive program credit carryback (including deficiencies which may be 
assessed pursuant to the provisions of section 6213(b)(2) ) may be 
assessed at any time before the expiration of the period within which a 
deficiency for the taxable year of the unused work incentive program 
credit which results in such carryback may be assessed, or, with respect 
to any portion of a work incentive program credit carryback from a 
taxable year attributable to a net operating loss or capital loss 
carryback from a subsequent taxable year, at any time before the 
expiration of the period within which a deficiency for such subsequent 
taxable year may be assessed.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(o)-2  Special rules for partnership items of federally registered partnerships.

    (a) In general. In the case of any tax imposed by subtitle A with 
respect to any person, the period for assessing a deficiency 
attributable to any partnership item of a federally registered 
partnership shall not expire before the later of--
    (1) The date which is 4 years after the date on which the return of 
the federally registered partnership for the partnership taxable year in 
which the item arose is filed (or, if later, the date prescribed for 
filing the return), or
    (2) If the name or address of the person against whom the assessment 
is sought does not appear on the return of the federally registered 
partnership, the date which is 1 year after the date on which a 
satisfactory identifying statement is furnished in writing to the 
director of the service center with which the partnership return is 
filed. A satisfactory identifying statement is a written statement 
providing the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of both 
the partner and the partnership. The statement shall note the 
partnership taxable year for which the statement is furnished.
    (b) ``Pass through'' entity as partner. In the case of a partnership 
having a ``pass through'' entity (i.e., partnership, electing small 
business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), trust, estate, or 
nominee) as a partner, the 1 year period described in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section shall not begin with respect to the person to be 
assessed until the chain of ownership linking the taxpayer with the 
federally registered partnership in which the item originally arose is 
fully disclosed.

    Example. Partnership U, a federally registered partnership, has two 
partners, Partnerships W and X. The partners of W are A and B, who are 
individuals, and T, a trust whose beneficiaries are individuals C and D. 
The partners of X are E, an individual, and Partnership Y whose partners 
are individuals F, G, and H. U and X properly disclose the identity of 
their partners. W, however, discloses the identity of only A and B, and 
Y discloses the identity of only F and G. The period of limitation 
described in paragraph (a) of this section for items attributable to U 
does not expire with respect to T, C, D, and H until one year after the 
chain of ownership linking these taxpayers with U is fully disclosed.

    (c) Federally registered partnership--(1) In general. With respect 
to any partnership taxable year, a federally registered partnership is 
any partnership--
    (i) Interests in which have been offered for sale at any time during 
the taxable year or a prior taxable year in an offering required to be 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
    (ii) Which, at any time during the taxable year or a prior taxable 
year, was subject to the annual reporting requirements of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission which relate to the protection of investors in 
the partnership.

For purposes of the preceding sentence an interest is ``offered for 
sale'' when it is the subject of an ``offer for sale'' as that term is 
used in section 2 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b).
    (2) Certain reporting requirements not taken into account. A 
requirement to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
for any purpose other than to protect investors does not cause the 
partnership to be treated as a federally registered partnership.

[[Page 300]]

For example, a brokerage firm organized as a partnership is not a 
federally registered partnership merely because it files reports 
required by the Commission for regulatory purposes.
    (d) Extension by agreement--(1) In general. Any general partner of a 
federally registered partnership (or any other person authorized by the 
partnership) may, prior to the expiration of the limitation period 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, extend the period for 
assessing a deficiency attributable to a partnership item for
any period of time agreed upon in writing. The extension shall become 
effective when the agreement has been executed by the district director 
or the service center director and shall be binding on all persons whose 
liability for tax imposed by subtitle A is affected in whole or in part 
by partnership items flowing from the partnership.
    (2) Authorization of other persons. The partnership may authorize 
persons other than the general partners to extend the period of 
limitation for assessing a deficiency attributable to a partnership 
item. This authorization shall be in writing, shall clearly identify the 
person being authorized and the action being authorized, and shall be 
signed by all the general partners. The authorization shall become 
effective when filed with the district director and shall remain in 
effect until a written revocation signed as provided in the preceding 
sentence is filed.
    (3) Removing authority of general partners. A partnership wishing to 
deny to some or all of the general partners the authority to execute an 
agreement extending the period of limitation for assessment may do so by 
submitting a written statement to that effect. The statement shall 
either identify the partners exclusively authorized to execute such an 
agreement or declare that one or more named partners or all partners 
lack the authority to execute such an agreement. The statement shall be 
signed by all the general partners. The statement shall become effective 
when filed with the district director and shall remain in effect until a 
statement revoking or superseding it and signed as provided in the 
preceding sentence is filed.
    (e) Special period of limitation with respect to carryback of net 
operating loss, capital, loss, etc. The provisions of section 6501(o) 
must also be taken into account in applying the various special periods 
of limitation prescribed in sections 6501 (h), (i) and (j). Thus, to the 
extent that a carryback is attributable to a partnership item of a 
federally registered partnership, the period for assessing a deficiency 
attributable to that carryback shall not expire before the date 
determined under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the 
partnership taxable year in which the item arose.
    (f) Otherwise applicable limitation period. The special provisions 
of section 6501(o) and this section do not terminate any otherwise 
applicable period for assessing a deficiency. Thus, the fact that more 
than 4 years have elapsed since the filing of the partnership return for 
the year in issue does not prevent assessment against a partner based on 
partnership items if an otherwise applicable period of limitation for 
the partner has not yet expired

    Example. Partnership V files its return for the taxable year ending 
December 31, 1980, on April 15, 1981. A, a partner in Partnership V, 
agrees to extend the assessment period for A's taxable year ending 
December 31, 1980, until September 30, 1985. The partnership does not 
agree to any extension under section 6501(o)(3) so that the period for 
assessing a deficiency attributable to partnership items could expire on 
April 15, 1985. A deficiency may be assessed against A for 1980 at any 
time prior to October 1, 1985, even if that deficiency is based on 
partnership items.

    (g) Effective date. This section and Sec. 301.6501(o)-3 are 
effective generally for partnership items arising in partnership taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1978 and before September 4, 1982. 
This section shall not apply, however, to any partnership taxable year 
with respect to which the amendments made to Code section 6501(o) by 
section 402 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 are 
effective. See section 407(a)(3) of that Act.

(Sec. 6501(o) (as it read before the enactment of the Tax Equity and 
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954 (92 Stat. 2818, 26 U.S.C. 6501(o); 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6501(o)-3  Partnership items.

    (a) Partnership item defined. For purposes of section 6501(o) (as it 
read before the enactment of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility 
Act of 1982), Sec. 301.6501(o)-2, and Sec. 301.6511(g)-1, the term 
``partnership item'' means--
    (1) Any item required to be taken into account for the partnership 
taxable year under any provision of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the 
Code, to the extent that the item is designated in paragraph (b) of this 
section as more appropriately determined at the partnership level than 
at the partner level, and
    (2) Any other item to the extent affected by an item described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.

The items described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section include items 
related to the partnership (for example, a partner's basis in the 
partnership interest) as well as more general items whose computation 
may be affected by changes to items described in paragraph (b) of this 
section (for example, adjusted gross income, self-employment tax, income 
averaging, medical deduction, and charitable contribution deduction).
    (b) Items more appropriately determined at the partnership level. 
The following items which are required to be taken into account for the 
taxable year of a partnership under subchapter K of chapter 1 of the 
Code are more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at 
the partner level:
    (1) The partnership aggregate and each partner's share of each of 
the following:
    (i) Items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the 
partnership;
    (ii) Expenditures by the partnership not deductible in computing its 
taxable income (for example, foreign taxes and charitable 
contributions);
    (iii) Items of the partnership which may be tax preference items 
under section 57(a) for any partner;
    (iv) Income of the partnership exempt from tax;
    (v) Partnership liabilities (including determinations with respect 
to the amount of the liabilities, whether the liabilities are 
nonrecourse, and changes from the preceding taxable year); and
    (vi) Other amounts with respect to partnership investments, 
transactions, and operations necessary to enable partners to compute--
    (A) The credit provided by section 38;
    (B) Recapture under section 47 of the credit provided by section 38,
    (C) Their amounts at risk in any activity to which section 465 
applies, and
    (D) The depletion allowance under section 613A with respect to oil 
and gas wells;
    (2) Guaranteed payments;
    (3) Optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property 
pursuant to an election under section 754 (including necessary 
preliminary determinations, such as the determination of a transferee 
partner's basis in a partnership interest); and
    (4) To the extent that the determination can be made from 
determinations that are necessary at the partnership level with respect 
to an amount, the character of an amount, or the percentage interest of 
a partner in the partnership for purposes of the partnership books and 
records or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner--
    (i) Contributions to the partnership;
    (ii) Distributions from the partnership;
    (iii) Amounts to be taken into account by a partner dealing with the 
partnership in a transaction to which section 707(a) applies (including 
the application of section 707(b));
    (iv) The application to the distributee partner of section 751(b); 
and
    (v) The application to the transferor partner of section 751(a).
    (c) Illustrations. This paragraph (c) illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The factors enumerated are not 
exhaustive; there may be additional partnership-level determinations 
with respect to a determination listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section.
    (1) Contributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for 
purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs 
to determine:
    (i) The character of an amount received from a partner (for example, 
whether it is a contribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);
    (ii) The amount of money contributed by a partner;

[[Page 302]]

    (iii) The applicability of the investment company rules of section 
721(b) with respect to a contribution; and
    (iv) The basis to the partnership of contributed property. To the 
extent that a determination with respect to a contribution can be made 
from these and similar partnership-level determinations, therefore, the 
determination is more appropriately made at the partnership level. To 
the extent that that determination requires other information, however, 
that determination is more appropriately made at the partner level. For 
example, it may be necessary to determine whether the contribution of 
the property causes recapture from the contributing partner of the 
credit provided under section 38 in certain circumstances in which that 
determination is irrelevant to the partnership.
    (2) Distribution. For purposes of its books and records, or for 
purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs 
to determine:
    (i) The charter of an amount transferred to a partner (for example, 
whether it is a distribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);
    (ii) The amount of money distributed to a partner;
    (iii) The adjusted basis to the partnership of distributed property; 
and
    (iv) The character of partnership property (for example, whether an 
item is inventory or a capital asset). To the extent that a 
determination with respect to a distribution can be made from these and 
similar partnership-level determinations, therefore, the determination 
is more appropriately made at the partnership level. To the extent that 
that determination requires other information, however, that 
determination is more appropriately made at the partnership level. Such 
other information would include certain factors used in determining the 
partner's basis for the partnership interest, such as the amount that 
the partner paid to acquire the partnership interest from a transferor 
partner if that transfer was not covered by an election under section 
754.
    (3) Transactions to which section 707(a) applies. For purposes of 
its books and records, the partnership needs to determine:
    (i) The amount transferred from the partnership to a partner or from 
a partner to the partnership in any transaction to which section 707(a) 
applies;
    (ii) The character of such an amount (for example, whether or not it 
is a loan; in the case of amounts paid over time for the purchase of an 
asset, what portion is interest); and
    (iii) The percentage of the capital interests and profits interests 
in the partnership owned by each partner.

To the extent that a determination with respect to a transaction to 
which section 707(a) applies can be made from these and similar 
partnership-level determinations, therefore, that determination is more 
appropriately made at the partnership level. To the extent that the 
determination requires other information, however, that determination is 
more appropriately made at the partner level. Examples of such other 
information are the cost to the partner of goods sold to the partnership 
and the extent to which the partner may be treated under section 267(c) 
as the constructive owner of a capital or profits interest actually 
owned by another.
    (4) Application of section 751. For purposes of its books and 
records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner for use 
in applying section 751, the partnership needs to determine:
    (i) The fair market value and adjusted basis of the partnership's--
    (A) Unrealized receivables (within the meaning of section 751(c)),
    (B) Substantially appreciated inventory (within the meaning of 
section 751(d)), and
    (C) Other property;
    (ii) A partner's share of each of the classes of assets described in 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; and
    (iii) Whether a distribution to a partner is a disproportionate 
distribution subject to section 751(b).

To the extent that a determination with respect to the application of 
section 751 can be made from these and similar partnership-level 
determinations, therefore, that determination is more appropriately made 
at the partnership level. To the extent that the determination requires 
other information, however, that determination is

[[Page 303]]

more appropriately made at the partner level. An example of such other 
information is the amount realized by a partner on the sale of a 
partnership interest.

(Sec. 6501(o) (as it read before the enactment of the Tax Equity and 
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code

Sec. 301.6502-1  Collection after assessment.

    (a) Length of period--(1) General rule. In any case in which a tax 
has been assessed within the statutory period of limitation properly 
applicable thereto, a proceeding in court to collect such tax may be 
begun, or levy for the collection of such tax may be made, within 10 
years after the assessment thereof.
    (2) Extension by agreement. (i) The 10-year period of limitation on 
collection after assessment of any tax may, prior to the expiration 
thereof, be extended for any period of time agreed upon in writing by 
the taxpayer and the district director. The extension shall become 
effective upon execution of the agreement by both the taxpayer and the 
district director.
    (ii) The period of limitation on collection after assessment of any 
tax (including any extension of such period) may be extended after the 
expiration thereof if there has been a levy on any part of the 
taxpayer's property prior to such expiration and if the extension is 
agreed upon in writing prior to a release of the levy under the 
provisions of section 6343. An extension under this subdivision has the 
same effect as an agreement made prior to the expiration of the period 
of limitation on collection after assessment, and during the period of 
the extension collection may be enforced as to all property or rights to 
property owned by the taxpayer whether or not seized under the levy 
which was released.
    (iii) Any period agreed upon under the provisions of this 
subparagraph may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made 
before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
    (3) If a proceeding in court for the collection of a tax is begun 
within the period provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (or 
within any extended period as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section), the period during which the tax may be collected by levy is 
extended until the liability for the tax or a judgment against the 
taxpayer arising from the liability is satisfied or becomes 
unenforceable.
    (b) Date when levy is considered made. The date on which a levy on 
property or rights to property is made is the date on which the notice 
of seizure provided in section 6335(a) is given.
    (c) Effective dates. (1) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall 
apply to--
    (i) Taxes assessed after November 5, 1990; and
    (ii) Taxes assessed on or before November 5, 1990, if the period 
prescribed in section 6502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(determined without regard to the amendments made by the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1990) for the collection of such taxes has not 
expired as of such date.
    (2) Paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall apply to levies issued 
after November 10, 1988.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6503(a)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitation; issuance of statutory notice of deficiency.

    (a) General rule. (1) Upon the mailing of a notice of deficiency for 
income, estate, gift, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax under the provisions 
of section 6212, the period of limitation on assessment and collection 
of any deficiency is suspended for 90 days after the mailing of a notice 
of such deficiency if the notice of deficiency is addressed to a person 
within the States of the Union and the District of Columbia, or 150 days 
if such notice of deficiency is addressed to a person outside the States 
of the Union and the District of Columbia (not counting Saturday, 
Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the 90th or 
150th day), plus an additional 60 days thereafter in either case. If a 
proceeding in respect of the deficiency is placed on the docket of the 
Tax Court, the period of limitation

[[Page 304]]

is suspended until the decision of the Tax Court becomes final, and for 
an additional 60 days thereafter. If a notice of deficiency is mailed to 
a taxpayer within the period of limitation and the taxpayer does not 
appeal therefrom to the Tax Court, the notice of deficiency so given 
does not suspend the running of the period of limitation with respect to 
any additional deficiency shown to be due in a subsequent deficiency 
notice.
    (2) This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. A taxpayer filed a return for the calendar year 1973 on 
April 15, 1974; the notice of deficiency was mailed to him (at an 
address within the United States) on April 15, 1977; and he filed a 
petition with the Tax Court on July 14, 1977. The decision of the Tax 
Court became final on November 6, 1978. The running of the period of 
limitation for assessment is suspended from April 15, 1977, to January 
5, 1979, which date is 60 days after the date (November 6, 1978), on 
which the decision became final. If in this example the taxpayer had 
failed to file a petition with the Tax Court, the running of the period 
of limitation for assessment would then be suspended from April 15, 1977 
(the date of notice), to September 12, 1977 (that is, for the 90-day 
period in which he could file a petition with the Tax Court, and for 60 
days thereafter).

    (3) For provisions relating to suspension of the running of the 
period of limitation with respect to collection of ``second tier'' 
excise taxes (as defined in section 4963) until final resolution of a 
refund proceeding described in sections 4961 and 7422 for the 
determination of the taxpayer's liability for the second tier taxes, see 
Sec. 53.4961-2 (e)(4).
    (b) Corporations joining in consolidated return. If a notice under 
section 6212(a) with respect to a deficiency in tax imposed by subtitle 
A of the Code for any taxable year is mailed to a corporation, the 
suspension of the running of the period of limitation provided in 
section 6503(a)(1) shall apply in the case of corporations with which 
such corporation made a consolidated income tax return for such taxable 
year. Under Sec. 1.1502-77(a) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), 
relating to consolidated returns, notices of deficiency are mailed only 
to the common parent.

Sec. 301.6503(b)-1   Suspension of running of period of limitation; assets of taxpayer in control or custody of court.

    Where all or substantially all of the assets of a taxpayer are in 
the control or custody of the court in any proceeding before any court 
of the United States, or of any State of the United States, or of the 
District of Columbia, the period of limitations on collection after 
assessment prescribed in section 6502 is suspended with respect to the 
outstanding amount due on the assessment for the period such assets are 
in the control or custody of the court, and for 6 months thereafter. In 
the case of an estate of a decedent or an incompetent, the period of 
limitations on collection is suspended only for periods beginning after 
November 2, 1966, during which assets are in the control or custody of a 
court, and for 6 months thereafter.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6503(c)-1   Suspension of running of period of limitation; location of property outside the United States or removal of property from the United 
          States; taxpayer outside of United States.

    (a) Property located outside, or removed from, the United States 
prior to November 3, 1966. The running of the period of limitations on 
collection after assessment prescribed in section 6502 is suspended for 
the period of time, prior to November 3, 1966, that collection is 
hindered or delayed because property of the taxpayer is situated or held 
outside the United States or is removed from the United States. The 
total suspension of time under this provision shall not in the aggregate 
exceed 6 years. In any case in which the district director determines 
that collection is so hindered or delayed, he shall make and retain in 
the files of his office a written report which shall identify the 
taxpayer and the tax liability, shall

[[Page 305]]

show what steps were taken to collect the tax liability, shall state the 
grounds for his determination that property of the taxpayer is situated 
or held outside, or is removed from, the United States, and shall show 
the date on which it was first determined that collection was so 
hindered or delayed. The term ``property'' includes all property or 
rights to property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, belonging 
to the taxpayer. The suspension of the running of the period of 
limitations on collection shall be considered to begin on the date so 
determined by the district director. A copy of the report shall be 
mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address.
    (b) Taxpayer outside United States after November 2, 1966. The 
running of the period of limitations on collection after assessment 
prescribed in section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment) is 
suspended for the period after November 2, 1966, during which the 
taxpayer is absent from the United States if such period is a continuous 
period of absence from the United States extending for 6 months or more. 
In a case where the running of the period of limitations has been 
suspended under the first sentence of this paragraph and at the time of 
the taxpayer's return to the United States the period of limitations 
would expire before the expiration of 6 months from the date of his 
return, the period of limitations shall not expire until after 6 months 
from the date of the taxpayer's return. The taxpayer will be deemed to

Sec. 301.6503(d)-1   Suspension of running of period of limitation; extension of time for payment of estate tax.

    Where an estate is granted an extension of time as provided in 
section 6161 (a)(2) or (b)(2), or under the provisions of section 6166, 
for payment of any estate tax, the running of the period of limitations 
for collection of such tax is suspended for the period of time for which 
the extension is granted.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6503(e)-1   Suspension of running of period of limitation; certain powers of appointment.

    Where the estate of a decedent is allowed an estate tax charitable 
deduction under the provisions of section 2055(b)(2) (with respect to 
property over which the decedent's surviving spouse was given a power of 
appointment exercisable in favor of charitable organizations) subject to 
the later disallowance of the deduction if all conditions set forth in 
section 2055(b)(2) are not complied with, the running of the period of 
limitation for assessment or collection of any estate tax imposed on the 
decedent's estate is suspended until 30 days after the expiration of the 
period for assessment or collection of the estate tax imposed on the 
estate of the decedent's surviving spouse.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6503(f)-1   Suspension of running of period of limitation; wrongful seizure of property of third party.

    The running of the period of limitations on collection after 
assessment prescribed in section 6502 (relating to collection after 
assessment) shall be suspended for a period equal to a period beginning 
on the date property (including money) is wrongfully seized or received 
by a district director and ending on the date 30 days after the date on 
which the district director returns the property pursuant to section 
6343(b) (relating to authority to return property) or the date 30 days 
after the date on which a judgment secured pursuant to section 7426 
(relating to civil actions by persons other than taxpayers) with respect 
to such property becomes final. The running of the period of limitations 
on collection after assessment shall be suspended under this section 
only with respect to the amount of such assessment which is equal to the 
amount of money or the value of specific property returned. This section 
applies in the case of property wrongfully seized or received after 
November 2, 1966.

    Example. On June 1, 1968 (at which time 10 months remain before the 
period of limitations on collection after assessment will expire), the 
district director wrongfully seizes $1,000 in B's account in Bank X and 
properly seizes $500 in taxpayer A's account in Bank Y

[[Page 306]]

in an attempt to satisfy A's assessed tax liability of $1,500. The 
district director determines that the $1,000 seized in Bank X was not 
the property of taxpayer A and, on March 1, 1969, he returns the $1,000 
to B. As a result of the wrongful seizure, the running of the period of 
limitations on collection after assessment of the amount owed by 
taxpayer A is suspended for the 9-month period (beginning June 1, 1968, 
when the money was wrongfully seized and ending March 1, 1969, when the 
money was returned to B), plus 30 days. Therefore, the period of 
limitations on collection after assessment prescribed in section 6502 
will not expire until February 1, 1970, which is 10 months plus 30 days 
after the money was returned.

Sec. 301.6503(g)-1  Suspension pending correction.

    The running of the periods of limitations provided in sections 6501 
and 6502 on the making of assessments, the collection by levy, or a 
proceeding in court in respect of any tax imposed by chapter 42 or 
section 507, 4971, or 4975 shall be suspended for any period described 
in section 507(g)(2) or during which the Commissioner has extended the 
time for making correction under section 4963(e)(1)(B).

For provisions relating to redemption of unused stamps, see section 
6805.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6511(c)-1   Special rules applicable in case of extension of time by agreement.

    (a) Scope. If, within the period prescribed in section 6511(a) for 
the filing of a claim for credit or refund, an agreement extending the 
period for assessment of a tax has been made in accordance with the 
provisions of section 6501(c)(4), the special rules provided in this 
section become applicable. This section shall not apply to any claim 
filed, or credit or refund allowed if no claim is filed, either (1) 
prior to the execution of an agreement extending the period in which 
assessment may be made, or (2) more than 6 months after the expiration 
of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the 
agreement or any extension thereof.
    (b) Period in which claim may be filed. Claim for credit or refund 
of an overpayment may be filed, or credit or refund may be allowed if no 
claim is filed, at any time within which an assessment may be made 
pursuant to an agreement, or any extension thereof, under section 
6501(c)(4), and for 6 months thereafter.
    (c) Limit on amount to be credited or refunded. (1) If a claim is

credited or refunded under the provisions of section 6511(b)(2) if a 
claim had been filed on the date of the execution of the agreement.
    (2) If no claim is filed, the amount of credit or refund allowed or

not exceed the portion of the tax paid after the execution of the 
agreement and before the making of the credit or refund, plus the amount 
that could have been properly credited or refunded under the provisions

execution of the agreement.
    (d) Effective date of agreement. The agreement referred to in this 
section shall become effective when signed by the taxpayer and the 
district director or an assistant regional commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6511(d)-1   Overpayment of income tax on account of bad debts, worthless securities, etc.

    (a)(1) If the claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment 
of income tax on account of--
    (i) The deductibility by the taxpayer, under section 166 or section 
832(c), of a debt as a debt which became worthless, or, under section 
165(g), of a loss from the worthlessness of a security, or
    (ii) The effect that the deductibility of a debt or loss described 
in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph has on the application to the 
taxpayer of a carryover, then in lieu of the 3-year period from the time 
the return was filed in which claim may be filed or credit or refund 
allowed, as prescribed in section 6511 (a) or (b), the period shall be 7 
years from the date prescribed by law for filing the return (determined 
without regard to any extension of time for filing such return) for the 
taxable year for which the claim is made or the credit or refund allowed 
or made.
    (2) If the claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment on 
account of the effect that the deductibility of a debt or loss, 
described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), has on the 
application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback provided 
in section 172(b), the period in which claim for credit or refund may be 
filed shall be whichever of the following two periods expires later:
    (i) Seven years from the last date prescribed for filing the return 
(determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such 
return) for the taxable year of the net operating loss which results in 
such carryback, or
    (ii) The period which ends with the expiration of the period 
prescribed in

[[Page 308]]

section 6511(c) within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed 
with respect to the taxable year of the net operating loss which 
resulted in the carryback.
    (3) In the case of a claim for credit or refund involving items 
described in this section, the amount of the credit or refund may exceed 
the portion of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 
(b)(2) or (c), whichever is applicable, to the extent of the amount of 
the overpayment attributable to the deductibility of items described in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a). If the claim involves an 
overpayment based not only on the deductibility of items described in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), but based also on other items, 
the credit or refund cannot exceed the sum of the following:
    (i) The amount of the overpayment which is attributable to the 
deductibility of items described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(a), and
    (ii) The balance of such overpayment up to a limit of the portion, 
if any, of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 
(b)(2) or (c), or within the period provided in any other applicable 
provision of law.
    (4) If the claim involves an overpayment based not only on the 
deductibility of items described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(a), but based also on other items, and if the claim with respect to any 
items is barred by the expiration of any applicable period of 
limitation, the portion of the overpayment attributable to the items not 
so barred shall be determined by treating the allowance of such items as 
the first adjustment to be made in computing such overpayment.
    (b) If a claim for credit or refund is not filed within the 
applicable period described in paragraph (a) of this section, then 
credit or refund may be allowed or made only if claim therefor is filed 
or if such credit or refund is allowed within any period prescribed in 
section 6511 (a), (b), or (c), whichever is applicable, subject to the 
provisions thereof limiting the amount of credit or refund in the case 
of a claim filed, or, if no claim was filed, in the case of credit or 
refund allowed within such applicable period as prescribed in section 
6511 (b) or (c).
    (c) The provisions of this section and section 6511(d)(1) do not 
apply to an overpayment resulting from the deductibility of a debt that 
became partially worthless during the taxable year, but only to an 
overpayment resulting from the deductibility of a debt which became 
entirely worthless during such year.
    (d) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section with regard to 
an overpayment caused by the deductibility of a bad debt under section 
166 or section 832(c), or of a loss from the worthlessness of a security 
under section 165(g), are likewise applicable to an overpayment caused 
by the effect that the deductibility of such bad debt or loss has on the 
application to the taxpayer of a carryover or of a carryback.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6511(d)-2   Overpayment of income tax on account of net operating loss or capital loss carrybacks.

    (a) Special period of limitation. (1) If the claim for credit or 
refund relates to an overpayment of income tax attributable to a net 
operating loss carryback (provided in section 172(b)), or a capital loss 
carryback (provided in section 1212(a)), then in lieu of the 3-year 
period from the time the return was filed in which the claim may be 
filed or credit or refund allowed, as prescribed in section 6511 (a) or 
(b), the period shall be whichever of the following two periods expires 
later:
    (i) The period which ends with the expiration of the 15th day of the 
40th month (or 39th month, in the case of a corporation) following the 
end of the taxable year of the net operating loss or net capital loss 
which resulted in the carryback; or
    (ii) The period which ends with the expiration of the period 
prescribed in section 6511(c) within which a claim for credit or refund 
may be filed with respect to the taxable year of the net operating loss 
or net capital loss which resulted in the carryback except that--
    (a) With respect to an overpayment attributable to a net operating 
loss carryback to any year on account of a certification issued to the 
taxpayer under section 317 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the 
period shall not expire before the expiration of the sixth month 
following the month in

[[Page 309]]

which such certification is issued to the taxpayer, and
    (b) With respect to an overpayment attributable to the creation of, 
or an increase in, a net operating loss as a result of the elimination 
of excessive profits by a renegotiation (as defined in section 
1481(a)(1)(A) ), the period shall not expire before September 1, 1959, 
or the expiration of the 12th month following the month in which the 
agreement or order for the elimination of such excessive profits becomes 
final, whichever is the later.
    (2) In the case of a claim for credit or refund involving a net 
operating loss or capital loss carryback described in subparagraph (1) 
of this paragraph (a), the amount of the credit or refund may exceed the 
portion of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 
(b)(2) or (c), whichever is applicable, to the extent of the amount of 
the overpayment attributable to the carryback. If the claim involves an 
overpayment based not only on a net operating loss or capital loss 
carryback described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), but based 
also on other items, the credit or refund cannot exceed the sum of the 
following:
    (i) The amount of the overpayment which is attributable to the net 
operating loss or capital loss carryback, and
    (ii) The balance of such overpayment up to a limit of the portion, 
if any, of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 
(b)(2) or (c), or within the period provided in any other applicable 
provision of law.
    (3) If the claim involves an overpayment based not only on a net 
operating loss or capital loss carryback described in subparagraph (1) 
of this paragraph (a), but based also on other items, and if the claim 
with respect to any items is barred by the expiration of any applicable 
period of limitation, the portion of the overpayment attributable to the 
items not so barred shall be determined by treating the allowance of 
such items as the first adjustment to be made in computing such 
overpayment. If a claim for credit or refund is not filed, and if credit 
or refund is not allowed, within the period prescribed in this 
paragraph, then credit or refund may be allowed or made only if claim 
therefor is filed, or if such credit or refund is allowed, within the 
period prescribed in section 6511 (a), (b), or (c), whichever is 
applicable, subject to the provisions thereof limiting the amount of 
credit or refund in the case of a claim filed, or if no claim was filed, 
in case of credit or refund allowed, within such applicable period. For 
the limitations on the allowance of interest for an overpayment where 
credit or refund is subject to the provisions of this section, see 
section 6611(f).
    (b)(1) Barred overpayments. If the allowance of a credit or refund 
of an overpayment of tax attributable to a net operating loss carryback 
or capital loss carryback is otherwise prevented by the operation of any 
law or rule of law (other than section 7122, relating to compromises), 
such credit or refund may be allowed or made under the provisions of 
section 6511(d)(2)(B) if a claim therefor is filed within the period 
provided by section 6511(d)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section for 
filing a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a 
carryback. Similarly, if the allowance of an application, credit, or 
refund of a decrease in the tax determined under section 6411(b) is 
otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law (other 
than section 7122), such application, credit, or refund may be allowed 
or made if an application for a tentative carryback adjustment is filed 
within the period provided in section 6411(a). Thus, for example, even 
though the tax liability (not including the net operating loss deduction 
or capital loss carryback (or the effect of such deduction or 
carryback)) for a given taxable year has previously been litigated 
before the Tax Court, credit or refund of an overpayment may be allowed 
or made despite the provisions of section 6512(a), if claim for such 
credit or refund is filed within the period provided in section 
6511(d)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of a claim 
for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a carryback, or 
in the case of an application for a tentative carryback adjustment, the 
determination of any court, including the Tax Court, in any proceeding 
in which the decision of the court has become final, shall be conclusive 
except with respect to the net operating loss

[[Page 310]]

deduction, and the effect of such deduction, or with respect to the 
determination of a short-term capital loss, and the effect of such 
short-term capital loss, to the extent that such deduction or short-term 
capital loss is affected by a carryback which was not in issue in such 
proceeding.
    (2) For purposes of the special period of limitation for filing a 
claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax with respect to a 
computation year (as defined in section 1302(c)(1)) by an individual who 
has chosen to compute his tax under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating 
to income averaging), such claim is determined to relate to an 
overpayment attributable to a net operating loss carryback when such 
carryback relates to any base period year (as defined in section 
1302(c)(3)). Thus, if (i) an individual has a net operating loss for a 
taxable year subsequent to a taxable year for which he had chosen the 
benefits of income averaging, and (ii) such net operating loss carryback 
is wholly utilized in any one or more of his base period years (which 
would result in an increased amount of averageable income for such 
computation year), the special period of limitation with respect to such 
individual's computation year applies and a timely claim for credit or 
refund with respect to the computation year may be filed.

    (a) Period in which claim may be filed. In the case of an 
overpayment of income tax resulting from a credit, allowed under the 
provisions of section 901 or under the provisions of any treaty to which 
the United States is a party, for taxes paid or accrued to a foreign 
country or possession of the United States, a claim for credit or refund 
must be filed by the taxpayer within 10 years from the last date 
prescribed for filing the return (determined without regard to any 
extension of time for filing such return) for the taxable year with 
respect to which the claim is made. Such 10-year period shall be applied 
in lieu of the 3-year period prescribed in section 6511(a).
    (b) Limit on amount to be credited or refunded. In the case of a 
claim described in paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of the 
credit or refund allowed or made may exceed the portion of the tax paid 
within the period prescribed in section 6511 (b) or (c), whichever is 
applicable, to the extent of the amount of the overpayment attributable 
to the allowance of a credit against income tax referred to in paragraph 
(a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6511(d)-4   Overpayment of income tax on account of investment credit carryback.

    (a) Special period of limitation. (1) If the claim for credit or 
refund relates to an overpayment of income tax attributable to an 
investment credit carryback, provided in section 46(b), then in lieu of 
the 3-year period from the time the return was filed in which the claim 
may be filed or credit or refund allowed, as prescribed in section 6511 
(a) or (b), the period shall be whichever of the following 2 periods 
expires later:
    (i) The period which ends with the expiration of the 15th day of the 
40th month (or 39th month, in the case of a corporation) following the 
end of the taxable year of the unused investment credit which resulted 
in the carryback (or, with respect to any portion of an investment 
credit carryback from a taxable year attributable to a net operating 
loss carryback or a capital loss carryback from a subsequent taxable 
year, the period which ends with the expiration of the 15th day of the 
40th month (or 39th month, in the case of a corporation) following the 
end of such subsequent taxable year); or
    (ii) The period which ends with the expiration of the period 
prescribed in section 6511(c) within which a claim for credit or refund 
may be filed with respect to the taxable year of the unused investment 
credit which resulted in the carryback.
    (2) In the case of a claim for credit or refund involving an 
investment credit carryback described in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, the amount of the credit or refund may exceed the portion of 
the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 (b)(2) or (c), 
whichever is applicable, to the extent

[[Page 311]]

of the amount of the overpayment attributable to the carryback. If the 
claim involves an overpayment based not only on an investment credit 
carryback described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), but based 
also on other items, the credit or refund cannot exceed the sum of the 
following:
    (i) The amount of the overpayment which is attributable to the 
investment credit carryback, and
    (ii) The balance of such overpayment up to a limit of the portion, 
if any, of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 
(b)(2) or (c), or within the period provided in any other applicable 
provision of law.
    (3) If the claim involves an overpayment based not only on an 
investment credit carryback described in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph (a), but based also on other items, and if the claim with 
respect to any items is barred by the expiration of any applicable 
period of limitation, the portion of the overpayment attributable to the 
items not so barred shall be determined by treating the allowance of 
such items as the first adjustment to be made in computing such 
overpayment. If a claim for credit or refund is not filed, and if credit 
or refund is not allowed, within the period prescribed in this 
paragraph, then credit or refund may be allowed or made only if claim 
therefor is filed, or if such credit or refund is allowed, within the 
period prescribed in section 6511 (a), (b), or (c), whichever is 
applicable, subject to the provisions thereof limiting the amount of 
credit or refund in the case of a claim filed, or if no claim was filed, 
in case of credit or refund allowed, within such applicable period. For 
the limitations on the allowance of interest for an overpayment where 
credit or refund is subject to the provisions of this section, see 
section 6611(f).
    (b) Barred overpayments. If the allowance of a credit or refund of 
an overpayment of tax attributable to an investment credit carryback is 
otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law (other 
than section 7122, relating to compromises), such credit or refund may 
be allowed or made under the provisions of section 6511(d)(4)(B) if a 
claim therefor is filed within the period provided by section 
6511(d)(4)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section for filing a claim for 
credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a carryback. In the 
case of a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a 
carryback, the determination of any court, including the Tax Court, in 
any proceeding in which the decision of the court has become final, 
shall not be conclusive with respect to the investment credit, and the 
effect of such credit, to the extent that such credit is affected by a 
carryback which was not in issue in such proceeding.

corporation) following the end of the taxable year of the unused WIN 
credit which resulted in the carryback (or, with respect to any portion 
of a WIN credit carryback from a taxable year attributable to a net 
operating loss carryback or a capital loss carryback from a subsequent 
taxable year, the period which ends with the expiration of the fifteenth 
day of the fortieth month (or thirty-ninth month in the case of a 
corporation) following the end of such subsequent taxable year); or
    (ii) The period which ends with the expiration of the period 
prescribed in section 6511(c) within which a claim for credit or refund 
may be filed with respect to the taxable year of the unused WIN credit 
which resulted in the carryback.
    (2) In the case of a claim for credit or refund involving a WIN 
credit

[[Page 312]]

carryback described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amount of 
the credit or refund may exceed the portion of the tax paid within the 
period provided in section 6511 (b)(2) or (c), whichever is applicable, 
to the extent of the amount of the overpayment attributable to the 
carryback. If the claim involves an overpayment based not only on a WIN 
credit carryback described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section but based 
also on other items, the credit or refund cannot exceed the sum of the 
following:
    (i) The amount of the overpayment which is attributable to the WIN 
credit carryback, and
    (ii) The balance of such overpayment up to a limit of the portion, 
if any, of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 
(b)(2) or (c), or within the period provided in any other applicable 
provision of law.
    (3) If the claim involves an overpayment based not only on a WIN 
credit carryback described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section but based 
also on other items, and if the claim with respect to any items is 
barred by the expiration of any applicable period of limitation, the 
portion of the overpayment attributable to the items not so barred shall 
be determined by treating the allowance of such items as the first 
adjustment to be made in computing such overpayment. If a claim for 
credit or refund is not filed, and if credit or refund is not allowed, 
within the period prescribed in this paragraph, then credit or refund 
may be allowed or made only if claim therefor is filed, or if such 
credit or refund is allowed, within the period prescribed in section 
6511 (a), (b), or (c), whichever is applicable, subject to the 
provisions thereof limiting the amount of credit or refund in the case 
of a claim filed, or if no claim was filed, in case of credit or refund 
allowed, within such applicable period. For the limitations on the 
allowance of interest for an overpayment where credit or refund is 
subject to the provisions of this section, see section 6611(f).
    (b) Barred overpayments. If the allowance of a credit or refund of 
an overpayment of tax attributable to a WIN credit carryback is 
otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law (other 
than section 7122, relating to compromises), such credit or refund may 
be allowed or made under the provisions of section 6511(d)(7)(B) if a 
claim therefor is filed within the period provided by section 
6511(d)(7)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section for filing a claim for 
credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a carryback. In the 
case of a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a 
carryback, the determination of any court, including the Tax Court, in 
any proceeding in which the decision of the courts has become final, 
shall not be conclusive with respect to the WIN credit, and the effect 
of such credit, to the extent that such credit is affected by a 
carryback which was not in issue in such proceeding.

Sec. 301.6511(e)-1   Special rules applicable to manufactured sugar.

    (a) Use as livestock feed and for distillation of alcohol. No 
payment shall be allowed or made under section 6418 (a) unless within 2 
years after the date the right to such payment has accrued a claim 
therefor is filed by the person entitled thereto. Such right accrues as 
of the date the manufactured sugar, or article manufactured therefrom, 
is used for a purpose for which payment is allowable under section 
6418(a).
    (b) Exportation. No payment shall be allowed or made under section 
6418 (b) unless within 2 years after the date the right to such payment 
has accrued a claim therefor is filed by the person entitled thereto. 
Such right accrues as of the date the articles are exported.

Sec. 301.6511(f)-1  Special rules for chapter 42 taxes.

    (a) In general. Claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of any 
tax imposed by chapter 42 shall be filed by the taxpayer within 3 years 
from the time a return was filed by the private foundation or trust (as 
the case may be) with respect to such tax, or within 2 years from the 
time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expire the later.
    (b) Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. In 1972, D, an individual taxpayer who was a disqualified 
person under

[[Page 313]]

the provisions of section 4946(a)(1), participated in an act of self-
dealing with a private foundation and incurred a tax under section 
4941(a)(1). The private foundation files a Form 990-PF on May 15, 1973, 
and discloses thereon that it has engaged in an act of self-dealing with 
D. D files a Form 4720 on July 2, 1973, and pays the amount of tax 
imposed by section 4941(a) with respect to such act of self-dealing. For 
purposes of this section, the return was filed on May 15, 1973, and any 
claim for credit or refund by D must be filed by May 17, 1976 (May 15, 
1976, was a Saturday).
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that D filed 
a Form 4720 on July 1, 1974, and pays the tax on that date. D must then 
file any claim for credit or refund by July 1, 1976.

Sec. 301.6511(g)-1  Special rule for partnership items of federally registered partnerships.

    (a) In general. In the case of any tax imposed by subtitle A with 
respect to any person, the period for filing a claim for credit or 
refund of any overpayment attributable to any partnership item of a 
federally registered partnership shall not expire before the later of--
    (1) The date which is 4 years after the date prescribed by law 
(including extensions thereof) for filing the partnership return for the 
partnership taxable year in which the item arose, or
    (2) If the taxpayer or a general partner or a person authorized to 
act on behalf of the partnership, as provided in Sec. 301.6501(o)-2(d), 
consents to extend the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to 
the partnership item before the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, the date 6 months after the expiration of the extension.
    (b) Limits on amount of credit or refund not applicable. In the case 
of a claim for credit or refund of any income tax overpayment 
attributable to any partnership item of a federally registered 
partnership, the limitations provided in section 6511(b) (2) and (c) 
shall not apply if the claim is filed within the period described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Special periods of limitation with respect to carryback of net 
operating loss, capital loss, etc. The provisions of section 6511(g) 
must also be taken into account in applying the various special periods 
of limitation prescribed in section 6511(d). Thus, to the extent that a 
carryback is attributable to a partnership item of a federally 
registered partnership, the period for filing a claim for credit or 
refund of an overpayment attributable to that carryback shall not expire 
before the date determined under paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to the partnership taxable year in which the item arose.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms 
``partnership item'' and ``federally registered partnership'' have the 
same meaning as such terms have when used in section 6501(o), 
Sec. 301.6501(o)-2(c), and Sec. 301.6501(o)-3.
    (e) Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective 
generally for partnership items arising in partnership taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1978 and before September 4, 1982. This 
section shall not apply, however, to any partnership taxable year with 
respect to which the amendments made to Code section 6511(g) by section 
402 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 are 
effective. See section 407(a)(3) of that Act.

(Sec. 6501(o) (as it read before the enactment of the Tax Equity and 
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954 (92 Stat. 2818, 26 U.S.C. 6501(o); 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C.

Sec. 301.6512-1  Limitations in case of petition to Tax Court.

    (a) Effect of petition to Tax Court--(1) General rule. If a person 
having a right to file a petition with the Tax Court with respect to a 
deficiency in income, estate, gift, or excise tax imposed by subtitle A 
or B, or chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 of the Code has filed such petition 
within the time prescribed in section 6213(a), no credit or refund of 
income tax for the same taxable year, of gift tax for the same calendar 
year or calendar quarter, of estate tax in respect of the taxable estate 
of the same decedent, or of tax imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 
with respect to any act (or failure to act) to which such petition 
relates, in respect of which a district director or director of a 
service center (or a regional director of appeals) has determined the 
deficiency, shall be allowed or made, and no suit in any

[[Page 314]]

court for the recovery of any part of such tax shall be instituted by 
the taxpayer, except as to items set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Exceptions. The exceptions to the rule stated in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph (a), are as follows:
    (i) An overpayment determined by a decision of the Tax Court which 
has become final;
    (ii) Any amount collected in excess of an amount computed in 
accordance with the decision of the Tax Court which has become final; 
and
    (iii) Any amount collected after the expiration of the period of 
limitation upon levying or beginning a proceeding in court for 
collection.
    (b) Overpayment determined by Tax Court. If the Tax Court finds that 
there is no deficiency and further finds that the taxpayer has made an 
overpayment of income tax for the same taxable year, of gift tax for the 
same calendar year or calendar quarter, of estate tax in respect of the 
taxable estate of the same decedent, or of tax imposed by chapter 41, 
42, 43, or 44 with respect to any act (or failure to act) to which such 
petition relates, in respect of which a district director, or director 
of a service center (or a regional director of appeals) has determined 
the deficiency, or finds that there is a deficiency but that the 
taxpayer has made an overpayment of such tax, the overpayment determined 
by the Tax Court shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer when the 
decision of the Tax Court has become final. (See section 7481, relating 
to the date when a Tax Court decision becomes final.) No such credit or 
refund shall be allowed or made of any portion of the tax unless the Tax 
Court determines as part of its decision that such portion was paid--
    (1) After the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or
    (2) Within the period which would be applicable under section 
6511(b)(2), (c), (d) or (g) (see Secs. 301.6511(b)-1. 301.6511(c)-1, 
301.6511(d)-1, 301.6511(d)-2, and 301.6511(d)-3), if on the date of the 
mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim had been filed (whether or 
not filed) stating the grounds upon which the Tax Court finds that there 
is an overpayment.
    (c) Jeopardy assessments. In the case of a jeopardy assessment made 
under section 6861(a), if the amount which should have been assessed as 
determined by a decision of the Tax Court which has become final is less 
than the amount already collected, the excess payment shall be credited 
or refunded subject to a determination being made by the Tax Court with 
respect to the time of payment as stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (d) Disallowance of deficiency by reviewing court. If the amount of 
the deficiency determined by the Tax Court (in a case where collection 
has not been stayed by the filing of a bond) is disallowed in whole or 
in part by the reviewing court, then the overpayment resulting from such 
disallowance shall be credited or refunded without the making of claim 
therefor, subject to a determination being made by the Tax Court with 
respect to the time of payment as stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section. (See section 7481, relating to date Tax Court decision becomes 
final.)
    (e) Collection in excess of amount determined by Tax Court. Where 
the amount collected is in excess of the amount computed in accordance 
with the decision of the Tax Court which has become final, the excess 
payment shall be credited or refunded within the period of limitation 
provided in section 6511.
    (f) Collection after expiration of statutory period. Where an amount 
is collected after the statutory period of limitation upon the beginning 
of levy or a proceeding in court for collection has expired (see section 
6502, relating to collection after assessment), the taxpayer may file a 
claim for refund of the amount so collected within the period of 
limitation provided in section 6511. In any such case, the decision of 
the Tax Court as to whether the statutory period upon collection of the 
tax expired before notice of the deficiency was mailed shall, when the 
decision becomes final, be conclusive.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6513-1   Time return deemed filed and tax considered paid.

    (a) Early return or advance payment of tax. For purposes of section 
6511, a return filed before the last day prescribed

[[Page 315]]

by law or regulations for the filing thereof shall be considered as 
filed on such last day. For purposes of section 6511 (b)(2) and (c) and 
section 6512, payment of any portion of the tax made before the last day 
prescribed for payment shall be considered made on such last day. An 
extension of time for filing a return or for paying any tax, or an 
election to pay any tax in installments, shall not be given any effect 
in determining under this section the last day prescribed for filing a 
return or paying any tax.
    (b) Prepaid income tax. For purposes of section 6511 (relating to 
limitations on credit or refund) or section 6512 (relating to 
limitations in case of petition to Tax Court)--
    (1) Any tax actually deducted and withheld at the source during any 
calendar year under chapter 24 of the Code (relating to collection of 
income tax at source on wages) shall, in respect of the recipient of the 
income, be deemed to have been paid by him on the 15th day of the fourth 
month following the close of his taxable year with respect to which such 
tax is allowable as a credit under section 31 (relating to tax withheld 
on wages),
    (2) Any amount paid as estimated income tax for any taxable year 
shall be deemed to have been paid on the last day prescribed for filing 
the income tax return under section 6012 for such taxable year 
(determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such 
return), and
    (3) Any tax withheld at the source on or after November 13, 1966, 
under chapter 3 of the Code (relating to tax withheld on nonresident 
aliens and foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds) shall, in 
respect of the recipient of the income, be deemed to have been paid by 
such recipient on the last day prescribed for filing his income tax 
return under section 6012 for the taxable year (determined without 
regard to any extension of time for filing such return) with respect to 
which such tax is allowable as a credit under section 1462 (relating to 
withheld tax as credit to recipient of income).

Subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b), shall apply even though the 
recipient of the income has been granted under section 6012 and the 
regulations thereunder an exemption from the requirement of making an 
income tax return for the taxable year.
    (c) Return and payment of social security taxes and income tax 
withholding. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if a return 
(or payment) on or after November 13, 1966, of tax imposed by chapter 3 
of the Code (relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and 
foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds), or if a return (or 
payment) of tax imposed by chapter 21 of the Code (relating to the 
Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or by chapter 24 of the Code 
(relating to the collection of income tax at source on wages), for any 
period ending with or within a calendar year is filed or paid before 
April 15 of the succeeding calendar year, for purposes of section 6511 
(relating to limitations on credit or refund) the return shall be 
considered filed, or the tax considered paid, on April 15 of such 
succeeding calendar year.
    (d) Overpayment of income tax credited to estimated tax. If a 
taxpayer elects under the provisions of section 6402(b) to credit an 
overpayment of income tax for a taxable year against estimated tax for 
the succeeding taxable year, the amount so credited shall be considered 
a payment of income tax for such succeeding taxable year (whether or not 
claimed as a credit on the estimated tax return for such succeeding 
taxable year). If the treatment of such amount as a payment of income 
tax for the succeeding taxable year results in an overpayment for such 
succeeding taxable year, the period of limitations applicable to such 
overpayment is determined by reference to that taxable year. An election 
so to credit an overpayment of income tax precludes the allowance of a 
claim for credit or refund of such overpayment for the taxable year in 
which the overpayment arises.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6514(a)-1   Credits or refunds after period of limitation.

    (a) A refund of any portion of any internal revenue tax (or any 
interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty) 
shall be considered erroneous and a credit of any such portion shall be 
considered void:

[[Page 316]]

    (1) If made after the expiration of the period of limitation 
prescribed by section 6511 for filing claim therefor, unless prior to 
the expiration of such period claim was filed, or
    (2) In the case of a timely claim, if the credit or refund was made 
after the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed by section 
6532(a) for the filing of suit, unless prior to the expiration of such 
period suit was begun.
    (b) For procedure by the United States to recover erroneous refunds, 
see sections 6532(b) and 7405.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6514(b)-1   Credit against barred liability.

    Any credit against a liability in respect of any taxable year shall 
be void if the collection of such liability would be barred by the 
applicable statute of limitations at the time such credit is made.

              Mitigation of Effect of Period of Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 301.6521-1   Mitigation of effect of limitation in case of related employee social security tax and self-employment tax.

    (a) Section 6521 may be applied in the correction of a certain type 
of error involving both the tax on self-employment income under section 
1401 and the employee tax under section 3101 if the correction of the 
error as to one tax is, on the date the correction is authorized, 
prevented in whole or in part by the operation of any law or rule of law 
other than section 7122, relating to compromises. Examples of such law 
are sections 6212(c), 6401(a), 6501, 6511, 6512(a), 6514, 6532, 6901 
(c), (d) and (e), 7121, and 7459(e).
    (b) If the liability for either tax with respect to which the error 
was made has been compromised under section 7122, the provisions of 
section 6521 limiting the correction with respect to the other tax do 
not apply.
    (c) Section 6521 is not applicable if, on the date of the 
authorization, correction of the effect of the error is permissible as 
to both taxes without recourse to such section.
    (d) If, because an amount of wages, as defined in section 3121(a), 
is erroneously treated as self-employment income, as defined in section 
1402(b), or an amount of self-employment income is erroneously treated 
as wages, it is necessary in correcting the error to assess the correct 
tax and give a credit or refund for the amount of the tax erroneously 
paid, and if either, but not both, of such adjustments is prevented by 
any law or rule of law (other than section 7122), the amount of the 
assessment, or the amount of the credit or refund, authorized shall 
reflect the adjustment which would be made in respect of the other tax 
(either the tax on self-employment income under section 1401 or the 
employee tax under section 3101) but for the operation of such law or 
rule of law. For example, assume that during 1955 A paid $10 as tax on 
an amount erroneously treated as ``wages'', when such amount was 
actually self-employment income, and that credit or refund of the $10 is 
not barred. A should have paid a self-employment tax of $15 on the 
amount. If the assessment of the correct tax, that is, $15, is barred by 
the statute of limitations, no credit or refund of the $10 shall be made 
without offsetting against such $10 the $15, assessment of which is 
barred. Thus, no credit or refund in respect of the $10 can be made.
    (e) As another example, assume that during 1955 a taxpayer reports 
wages of $4,200 and net earnings from self-employment of $900. By reason 
of the limitations of section 1402(b) he shows no self-employment 
income. Assume further that by reason of a final decision by the Tax 
Court of the United States, further adjustments to the taxpayer's income 
tax liability are barred. The question of the amount of his wages, as 
defined in section 3121, was not in issue in the Tax Court litigation, 
but it is subsequently determined (within the period of limitations 
applicable under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act) that $700 of 
the $4,200 reported as wages was not for employment as defined in 
section 3121(b). Therefore, the taxpayer is entitled to the allowance of 
a refund of the $14 tax paid on such remuneration under section 3101. 
The reduction of his wages from $4,200 to $3,500 would result in the 
determination of $700 self-employment income, the tax on which is $21 
for the year. Under section 6521, the overpayment of

[[Page 317]]

$14 would be offset by the barred deficiency of $21, thus eliminating 
the refund otherwise allowable. If the facts were changed so that the 
taxpayer erroneously paid tax on self-employment income of $700, having 
been taxed on only $3,500 as wages, and within the period of limitations 
applicable under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, it is 
determined that his wages were $4,200, the tax of $14 under section 
3101, otherwise collectible, would be eliminated by offsetting under 
section 6521 the barred overpayment of $21. The balance of the barred 
overpayment, $7, cannot be credited or refunded.
    (f) Another illustration of the operation of section 6521 is the 
case of a taxpayer who, for 1955, is erroneously taxed on $2,500 as 
wages, the tax on which is $50, and who reports no self-employment 
income. After the period of limitations has run on the refund of the tax 
under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, it is determined that the 
amount treated as wages should have been reported as net earnings from 
self-employment. The taxpayer's self-employment income would then be 
$2,500 and the tax thereon would be $75. Assume that the period of 
limitations applicable to subtitle A of the Code has not expired, and 
that a notice of deficiency may properly be issued. Under section 6521, 
the amount of the deficiency of $75 must be reduced by the barred 
overpayment of $50.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6521-2   Law applicable in determination of error.

    The question of whether there was an erroneous treatment of self-
employment income or of wages is determined under the provisions of law 
and regulations applicable with respect to the year or other taxable 
period as to which the error was made. The fact that the error was in 
pursuance of an interpretation, either judicial or administrative, 
accorded such provisions of law and regulations at the time the action 
involved was taken is not necessarily determinative of this question. 
For example, if a later judicial decision authoritatively alters such 
interpretation so that such action is contrary to the applicable 
provisions of the law and regulations as later interpreted, the error 
comes within the scope of section 6521.

              Periods of Limitation in Judicial Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 301.6532-1   Periods of limitation on suits by taxpayers.

    (a) No suit or proceeding under section 7422(a) for the recovery of 
any internal revenue tax, penalty, or other sum shall be begun until 
whichever of the following first occurs:
    (1) The expiration of 6 months from the date of the filing of the 
claim for credit or refund, or
    (2) A decision is rendered on such claim prior to the expiration of 
6 months after the filing thereof.

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no suit or 
proceeding for the recovery of any internal revenue tax, penalty, or 
other sum may be brought after the expiration of 2 years from the date 
of mailing by registered mail prior to September 3, 1958, or by either 
registered or certified mail on or after September 3, 1958, by a 
district director, a director of an internal revenue service center, or 
an assistant regional commissioner to a taxpayer of a notice of 
disallowance of the part of the claim to which the suit or proceeding 
relates.
    (b) The 2-year period described in paragraph (a) of this section may 
be extended if an agreement to extend the running of the period of 
limitations is executed. The agreement must be signed by the taxpayer or 
by an attorney, agent, trustee, or other fiduciary on behalf of the 
taxpayer. If the agreement is signed by a person other than the 
taxpayer, it shall be accompanied by an authenticated copy of the power 
of attorney or other legal evidence of the authority of such person to 
act on behalf of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer is a corporation, the 
agreement should be signed with the corporate name followed by the 
signature of a duly authorized officer of the corporation. The agreement 
will not be effective until signed by a district director, a director of 
an internal revenue service center, or an assistant regional 
commissioner.
    (c) The taxpayer may sign a waiver of the requirement that he be 
mailed a notice of disallowance. Such waiver is

[[Page 318]]

irrevocable and will commence the running of the 2-year period described 
in paragraph (a) of this section on the date the waiver is filed. The 
waiver shall set forth:
    (1) The type of tax and the taxable period covered by the taxpayer's 
claim for refund;
    (2) The amount of the claim;
    (3) The amount of the claim disallowed;
    (4) A statement that the taxpayer agrees the filing of the waiver 
will commence the running of the 2-year period provided for in section 
6532(a)(1) as if a notice of disallowance had been sent the taxpayer by 
either registered or certified mail.

The filing of such a waiver prior to the expiration of 6 months from the 
date the claim was filed does not permit the filing of a suit for refund 
prior to the time specified in section 6532(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (d) Any consideration, reconsideration, or other action with respect 
to a claim after the mailing by registered mail prior to September 3, 
1958, or by either registered or certified mail on or after September 3, 
1958, of a notice of disallowance or after the execution of a waiver 
referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, shall not extend the 
period for bringing suit or other proceeding under section 7422(a).


<R05>
Sec. 301.6532-2   Periods of limitation on suits by the United States.

    The United States may not recover any erroneous refund by civil 
action under section 7405 unless such action is begun within 2 years 
after the making of such refund. However, if any part of the refund was 
induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact, the action to 
recover the erroneous refund may be brought at any time within 5 years 
from the date the refund was made.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6532-3   Periods of limitation on suits by persons other than taxpayers.

    (a) General rule. No suit or proceeding, except as otherwise 
provided in section 6532(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, under 
section 7426 and Sec. 301.7426-1 relating to civil actions by persons 
other than taxpayers, shall be begun after the expiration of 9 months 
from the date of levy or agreement under section 6325(b)(3) giving rise 
to such action.
    (b) Period when claim is filed. The 9-month period prescribed in 
section 6532(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section shall be extended 
to the shorter of,
    (1) 12 months from the date of filing by a third party of a written 
request under Sec. 301.6343-1(b)(2) for the return of property 
wrongfully levied upon, or
    (2) 6 months from the date of mailing by registered or certified 
mail by the district director to the party claimant of a notice of 
disallowance of the part of the request to which the action relates. A 
request which, under Sec. 301.6343-1(b)(3), is not considered adequate 
does not extend the 9-month period described in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On June 1, 1970, a tax is assessed against A with respect 
to his delinquent tax liability. On July 19, 1970, a levy is wrongfully 
made upon certain tangible personal property of B's which is in A's 
possession at that time. On July 20, 1970, notice of seizure is given to 
A. Thus, under section 6502(b), July 20, 1970, is the date on which the 
levy is considered to be made. Unless a request for the return of 
property is sooner made to extend the 9-month period, no suit or 
proceeding under section 7426 may be begun by B after April 20, 1971, 
which is 9 months from the date of levy.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in the preceding example except 
that, on August 3, 1970, B properly files a request for the return of 
his property wrongfully levied upon. Assume further that the district 
director mails, on March 1, 1971, a notice of disallowance of B's 
request for the return of the property. No suit or proceeding under 
section 7426 may be begun by B after August 3, 1971, which is 12 months 
from the date of filing a request for the return of property wrongfully 
levied upon.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in the preceding example except 
that the notice of disallowance of B's request for the return of 
property wrongfully levied upon is mailed to B on November 12, 1970. 
Since the 6-month period from the mailing of the notice of disallowance 
expires before the 12-month period from the date of filing the request 
for the return of property which ends on August 3, 1971, no suit or 
proceeding under section 7426 may be begun by B after May 12, 1971, 
which

[[Page 319]]

is 6 months from the date of mailing the notice of disallowance.

                        Interest on Underpayments


<R05>
Sec. 301.6601-1   Interest on underpayments.

    (a) General rule. (1) Interest at the annual rate referred to in the 
regulations under section 6621 shall be paid on any unpaid amount of tax 
from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax (determined without 
regard to any extension of time for payment) to the date on which 
payment is received.
    (2) For provisions requiring the payment of interest during the 
period occurring before July 1, 1975, see section 6601(a) prior to its 
amendment by section 7 of the Act of Jan. 3, 1975 (Pub. L. 93-625, 88 
Stat. 2115).
    (b) Satisfaction by credits made after December 31, 1957--(1) In 
general. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by the credit of an 
overpayment after December 31, 1957, interest shall not be imposed under 
section 6601 on such portion of the tax for any period during which 
interest on the overpayment would have been allowable if the overpayment 
had been refunded.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. An examination of A's income tax returns for the calendar 
years 1955 and 1956 discloses an underpayment of $800 for 1955 and an 
overpayment of $500 for 1956. Interest under section 6601(a) ordinarily 
accrues on the underpayment of $800 from April 15, 1956, to the date of 
payment. However, the 1956 overpayment of $500 is credited after 
December 31, 1957, against the underpayment in accordance with the 
provisions of section 6402(a) and Sec. 301.6402-1. Under such 
circumstances interest on the $800 underpayment runs from April 15, 
1956, the last date prescribed for payment of the 1955 tax, to April 15, 
1957, the date the overpayment of $500 was made. Since interest would 
have been allowed on the overpayment, if refunded, from April 15, 1957, 
to a date not more than 30 days prior to the date of the refund check, 
no interest is imposed after April 15, 1957, on $500, the portion of the 
underpayment satisfied by credit. Interest continues to run, however, on 
$300 (the $800 underpayment for 1955 less the $500 overpayment for 1956) 
to the date of payment.
    Example 2. An examination of A's income tax returns for the calendar 
years 1956 and 1957 discloses an overpayment, occurring on April 15, 
1957, of $700 for 1956 and an underpayment of $400 for 1957. After April 
15, 1958, the last date prescribed for payment of the 1957 tax, the 
district director credits $400 of the overpayment against the 
underpayment. In such a case, interest will accrue upon the overpayment 
of $700 from April 15, 1957, to April 15, 1958, the due date of the 
amount against which the credit is taken. Interest will also accrue 
under section 6611 upon $300 ($700 overpayment less $400 underpayment) 
from April 15, 1958, to a date not more than 30 days prior to the date 
of the refund check. Since a refund of the portion of the overpayment 
credited against the underpayment would have resulted in interest 
running upon such portion from April 15, 1958, to a date not more than 
30 days prior to the date of the refund check, no interest is imposed 
upon the underpayment.

    (c) Last date prescribed for payment. (1) In determining the last 
date prescribed for payment, any extension of time granted for payment 
of tax (including any postponement elected under section 6163(a)) shall 
be disregarded. The granting of an extension of time for the payment of 
tax does not relieve the taxpayer from liability for the payment of 
interest thereon during the period of the extension. Thus, except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section, interest at the annual rate 
referred to in the regulations under section 6621 is payable on any 
unpaid portion of the tax for the period during which such portion 
remains unpaid by reason of an extension of time for the payment 
thereof.
    (2)(i) If a tax or portion thereof is payable in installments in 
accordance with an election made under section 6152(a) or 6156(a), the 
last date prescribed for payment of any installment of such tax or 
portion thereof shall be determined under the provisions of section 
6152(b) or 6156(b), as the case may be, and interest shall run on any 
unpaid installment from such last date to the date on which payment is 
received. However, in the event installment privileges are terminated 
for failure to pay an installment when due as provided by section 
6152(d) and the time for the payment of any remaining installment is 
accelerated by the issuance of a notice and demand therefor,

[[Page 320]]

interest shall run on such unpaid installment from the date of the 
notice and demand to the date on which payment is received. But see 
section 6601(e)(4).
    (ii) If the tax shown on a return is payable in installments, 
interest will run on any tax not shown on the return from the last date 
prescribed for payment of the first installment. If a deficiency is 
prorated to any unpaid installments, in accordance with section 6152(c), 
interest shall run on such prorated amounts from the date prescribed for 
the payment of the first installment to the date on which payment is 
received.
    (3) If, by reason of jeopardy, a notice and demand for payment of 
any tax is issued before the last date otherwise prescribed for payment, 
such last date shall nevertheless be used for the purpose of the 
interest computation, and no interest shall be imposed for the period 
commencing with the date of the issuance of the notice and demand and 
ending on such last date. If the tax is not paid on or before such last 
date, interest will automatically accrue from such last date to the date 
on which payment is received.
    (4) In the case of taxes payable by stamp and in all other cases 
where the last date for payment of the tax is not otherwise prescribed, 
such last date for the purpose of the interest computation shall be 
deemed to be the date on which the liability for the tax arose. However, 
such last date shall in no event be later than the date of issuance of a 
notice and demand for the tax.
    (d) Suspension of interest; waiver of restrictions on assessment. In 
the case of a deficiency determined by a district director (or an 
assistant regional commissioner, appellate) with respect to any income, 
estate, gift, or chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax, if the taxpayer files 
with such internal revenue officer an agreement waiving the restrictions 
on assessment of such deficiency, and if notice and demand for payment 
of such deficiency is not made within 30 days after the filing of such 
waiver, no interest shall be imposed on the deficiency for the period 
beginning immediately after such 30th day and ending on the date notice 
and demand is made. In the case of an agreement with respect to a 
portion of the deficiency, the rules as set forth in this paragraph are 
applicable only to that portion of the deficiency to which the agreement 
relates.
    (e) Income tax reduced by carryback. (1) The carryback of a net 
operating loss, net capital loss, investment credit, or a work incentive 
program (WIN) credit shall not affect the computation of interest on any 
income tax for the period commencing with the last day prescribed for 
the payment of such tax and ending with the last day of the taxable year 
in which the loss or credit arises. For example, if the carryback of a 
net operating loss, a net capital loss, an investment credit, or a WIN 
credit to a prior taxable period eliminates or reduces a deficiency in 
income tax for that period, the full amount of the deficiency will 
nevertheless bear interest at the annual rate referred to in the 
regulations under section 6621 from the last date prescribed for payment 
of such tax until the last day of the taxable year in which the loss or 
credit arose. Interest will continue to run beyond such last day on any 
portion of the deficiency which is not eliminated by the carryback. With 
respect to any portion of an investment credit carryback or a WIN credit 
carryback from a taxable year attributable to a net operating loss 
carryback or a capital loss carryback from a subsequent taxable year, 
such investment credit carryback or WIN credit carryback shall not 
affect the computation of interest on any income tax for the period 
commencing with the last day prescribed for the payment of such tax and 
ending with the last day of such subsequent taxable year.
    (2) Where an extension of time for payment of income tax has been 
granted under section 6164 to a corporation expecting a net operating 
loss carryback or a net capital loss carryback, interest is payable at 
the annual rate established under section 6621 on the amount of such 
unpaid tax from the last date prescribed for payment thereof without 
regard to such extension.
    (3) Where there has been an allowance of an overpayment attributable 
to a net operating loss carryback, a capital loss carryback, an 
investment

[[Page 321]]

credit carryback, or a WIN credit carryback and all or part of such 
allowance is later determined to be excessive, interest shall be 
computed on the excessive amount from the last day of the year in which 
the net operating loss, net capital loss, investment credit, or WIN 
credit arose until the date on which the repayment of such excessive 
amount is received. Where there has been an allowance of an overpayment 
with respect to any portion of an investment credit carryback or a WIN 
credit carryback from a taxable year attributable to a net operating 
loss carryback or a capital loss carryback from a subsequent taxable 
year and all or part of such allowance is later determined to be 
excessive, interest shall be computed on the excessive amount from the 
last day of such subsequent taxable year until the date on which the 
repayment of such excessive amount is received.
    (f) Applicable rules. (1) Any interest prescribed by section 6601 
shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as tax and shall be 
paid upon notice and demand by the district director or the director of 
the regional service center. Any reference in the Code (except in 
subchapter B, chapter 63, relating to deficiency procedures) to any tax 
imposed by the Code shall be deemed also to refer to the interest 
imposed by section 6601 on such tax. Interest on a tax may be assessed 
and collected at any time within the period of limitation on collection 
after assessment of the tax to which it relates. For rules relating to 
the period of limitation on collection after assessment, see section 
6502.
    (2) No interest under section 6601 shall be payable on any interest 
provided by such section. This paragraph (f)(2) shall not apply after 
December 31, 1982, with respect to interest accruing after such date, or 
accrued but unpaid on such date. See Sec. 301.6622-1.
    (3) Interest shall not be imposed on any assessable penalty, 
addition to the tax, or additional amount less such assessable penalty, 
addition to the tax, or additional amount is not paid within 10 days 
from the date of notice and demand therefor. If interest is imposed, it 
shall be imposed only for the period from the date of the notice and 
demand to the date on which payment is received.
    (4) If notice and demand is made for any amount and such amount is 
paid within 10 days after the date of such notice and demand, interest 
shall not be imposed for the period after the date of such notice and 
demand.
    (5) No interest shall be imposed for failure to pay estimated tax as 
required by section 59 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 
6153 or 6154 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

Sec. 301.6602-1   Interest on erroneous refund recoverable by suit.

    Any portion of an internal revenue tax (or any interest, assessable 
penalty, additional amount, or addition to tax) which has been 
erroneously refunded, and which is recoverable by a civil action 
pursuant to section 7405, shall bear interest at the annual rate 
referred to in the regulations under section 6621 from the date of the 
payment of the refund.

                        Interest on Overpayments


<R05>
Sec. 301.6611-1   Interest on overpayments.

    (a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided, interest shall be 
allowed on any overpayment of any tax at the annual rate referred to in 
the regulations under section 6621 from the date of overpayment of the 
tax.
    (b) Date of overpayment. Except as provided in section 6401(a), 
relating to assessment and collection after the expiration of the 
applicable period of limitation, there can be no overpayment of tax 
until the entire tax liability has been satisfied. Therefore, the dates 
of overpayment of any tax are the date of payment of the first amount 
which (when added to previous payments) is in excess of the tax 
liability (including any interest, addition to the tax, or additional 
amount) and the dates of payment of all amounts subsequently paid with 
respect to such tax liability. For rules relating to the determination 
of

[[Page 322]]

the date of payment in the case of an advance payment of tax, a payment 
of estimated tax, and a credit for income tax withholding, see paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (c) Examples. The application of paragraph (b) may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation X files an income tax return on March 15, 
1955, for the calendar year 1954 disclosing a tax liability of $1,000 
and elects to pay the tax in installments. Subsequent to payment of the 
final installment, the correct tax liability is determined to be $900.

                              Tax liability                             
Assessed.......................................................   $1,000
Correct liability..............................................      900
                                                                --------
Overassessment.................................................      100
                                                                        
                           Record of payments                           
                                                                        
Mar. 15, 1955..................................................     $500
June 15, 1955..................................................      500
                                                                        

Since the correct liability in this case is $900, the payment of $500 
made on March 15, 1955, and $400 of the payment made on June 15, 1955, 
are applied in satisfaction of the tax liability. The balance of the 
payment made on June 15, 1955 ($100) constitutes the amount of the 
overpayment, and the date on which such payment was made would be the 
date of the overpayment from which interest would be computed.
    Example 2. Corporation Y files an income tax return for the calendar 
year 1954 on March 15, 1955, disclosing a tax liability of $50,000, and 
elects to pay the tax in installments. On October 15, 1956, a deficiency 
in the amount of $10,000 is assessed and is paid in equal amounts on 
November 15 and November 26, 1956. On April 15, 1957, it is determined 
that the correct tax liability of the taxpayer for 1954 is only $35,000.

                              Tax liability                             
Original assessment...........................................   $50,000
Deficiency assessment.........................................    10,000
                                                               ---------
Total assessed................................................    60,000
Correct liability.............................................    35,000
                                                               ---------
Overassessment................................................    25,000
                                                                        
                           Record of payments                           
                                                                        
Mar. 15, 1955.................................................   $25,000
June 15, 1955.................................................    25,000
Nov. 15, 1956.................................................     5,000
Nov. 26, 1956.................................................     5,000
                                                                        

Since the correct liability in this case is $35,000, the entire payment 
of $25,000 made on March 15, 1955, and $10,000 of the payment made on 
June 15, 1955, are applied in satisfaction of the tax liability. The 
balance of the payment made on June 15, 1955 ($15,000), plus the amounts 
paid on November 15 ($5,000), and November 26, 1956 ($5,000), constitute 
the amount of the overpayment. The dates of the overpayments from which 
interest would be computed are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Amount of 
                            Date                             overpayment
------------------------------------------------------------------------
June 15, 1955..............................................      $15,000
Nov. 15, 1956..............................................        5,000
Nov. 26, 1956..............................................        5,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The amount of any interest paid with respect to the deficiency of 
$10,000 is also an overpayment.

    (d) Advance payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for 
income tax withholding. In the case of an advance payment of tax, a 
payment of estimated income tax, or a credit for income tax withholding, 
the provisions of section 6513 (except the provisions of subsection (c) 
thereof), applicable in determining the date of payment of tax for 
purposes of the period of limitations on credit or refund, shall apply 
in determining the date of overpayment for purposes of computing 
interest thereon.
    (e) Refund of income tax caused by carryback. If any overpayment of 
tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code results from the carryback of a 
net operating loss, a net capital loss, an investment credit, or a work 
incentive (WIN) credit, such overpayment, for purposes of this section, 
shall be deemed not to have been made prior to the end of the taxable 
year in which the loss or credit arises, or, with respect to any portion 
of an investment credit carryback or a WIN credit carryback from a 
taxable year attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a capital 
loss carryback from a subsequent taxable year, such overpayment shall be 
deemed not to have been made prior to the close of such subsequent 
taxable year.
    (f) Refund of income tax caused by carryback of foreign taxes. For 
purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, any overpayment of tax 
resulting from a

[[Page 323]]

carryback of tax paid or accrued to foreign countries or possessions of 
the United States shall be deemed not to have been paid or accrued 
before the close of the taxable year under subtitle F of the Code in 
which such taxes were in fact paid or accrued.
    (g) Period for which interest allowable in case of refunds. If an 
overpayment of tax is refunded, interest shall be allowed from the date 
of the overpayment to a date determined by the district director or the 
director of the regional service center, which shall be not more than 30 
days prior to the date of the refund check. The acceptance of a refund 
check shall not deprive the taxpayer of the right to make a claim for 
any additional overpayment and interest thereon, provided the claim is 
made within the applicable period of limitation. However, if a taxpayer 
does not accept a refund check, no additional interest on the amount of 
the overpayment included in such check shall be allowed.
    (h) Period for which interest allowable in case of credits--(1) 
General rule. If an overpayment of tax is credited, interest shall be 
allowed from the date of overpayment to the due date (as determined 
under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (h)) of the amount against 
which such overpayment is credited.
    (2) Determination of due date--(i) In general. The term ``due 
date'', as used in this section, means the last day fixed by law or 
regulations for the payment of the tax (determined without regard to any 
extension of time), and not the date on which the district director or 
the director of the regional service center makes demand for the payment 
of the tax. Therefore, the due date of a tax (other than an additional 
assessment subject to the special rule provided by subdivision (iv) of 
this subparagraph) is the date fixed for the payment of the tax or the 
several installments thereof.
    (ii) Tax payable in installments--(a) In general. In the case of a 
credit against a tax, where the taxpayer had properly elected to pay the 
tax in installments, the due date is the date prescribed for the payment 
of the installment against which the credit is applied.
    (b) Delinquent installment. If the taxpayer is delinquent in payment 
of an installment of tax and a notice and demand has been issued for the 
payment of the delinquent installment and the remaining installments, 
the due date of each remaining installment shall then be the date of 
such notice and demand.
    (iii) Tax or installment not yet due. If a taxpayer agrees to the 
crediting of an overpayment against tax or an installment of tax and the 
schedule of allowance is signed prior to the date on which such tax or 
installment would otherwise become due, then the due date of such tax or 
installment shall be the date on which such schedule is signed.
    (iv) Additional assessment satisfied by credit before Jafuary 1, 
1958. In the case of a credit made before January 1, 1958, against an 
additional assessment, the due date of the tax satisfied by the credit 
is the date the additional assessment was made. For purposes of this 
subdivision, the term ``additional assessment'' means a further 
assessment of a tax of the same character previously paid in part, and 
includes the assessment of a deficiency as defined in section 6211.
    (v) Interest. In the case of a credit against interest that accrues 
for any period ending prior to January 1, 1983, the due date is the 
earlier of the date of assessment of such interest or December 31, 1982. 
In the case of a credit against interest that accrues for any period 
beginning on or after December 31, 1982, such interest is due as it 
economically accrues on a daily basis, rather than when it is assessed.
    (vi) Additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty. 
In the case of a credit against an additional amount, addition to the 
tax, or assessable penalty, the due date is the earlier of the date of 
assessment or the date from which such amount would bear interest if not 
satisfied by payment or credit.
    (vii) Estimated income tax for succeeding year. If the taxpayer 
elects to have all or part of the overpayment shown by his return 
applied to his estimated tax for his succeeding taxable year, no 
interest shall be allowed on such portion of the overpayment credited 
and such amount shall be applied as a payment on account of the 
estimated tax for such year or the installments thereof.

    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Refund of overpayment. No interest shall be allowed on any 
overpayment of tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code if such overpayment 
is refunded--
    (1) In the case of a return filed on or before the last date 
prescribed for filing the return of such tax (determined without regard 
to any extension of time for filing such return), within 45 days after 
such last date, or
    (2) After December 17, 1966, in the case of a return filed after the 
last day prescribed for filing the return, within 45 days after the date 
on which the return is filed.

However, in the case of any overpayment of tax by an individual (other 
than an estate or trust and other than a nonresident alien individual) 
for a taxable year beginning in 1974, ``60 days'' shall be substituted 
for ``45 days'' each place it appears in this paragraph.
    (k) Effective date. Paragraphs (h)(2)(v) and (h)(2)(vi) of this 
section are effective for credits made on or after August 25, 1992.

                     Determination of Interest Rate


<R05>
Sec. 301.6621-1  Interest rate.

    (a) In general. The interest rate established under section 6621 
shall be--
    (1) On amounts outstanding before July 1, 1975, 6 percent per annum 
(or 4 percent in the case of certain extensions of time for payment of 
taxes as provided in sections 6601 (b) and (j) prior to amendment by 
section 7(b) of the Act of Jan. 3, 1975 (Pub. L. 93-625, 88 Stat. 2115), 
and certain overpayments of the unrelated business income tax as 
provided in section 514(b)(3)(D), prior to its amendment by such Act).
    (2) On amounts outstanding--

                                                                                                                
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     After                                   And before               Rate per annum (percent)  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
June 30, 1975..................................  Feb. 1, 1976.....................                             9
Jan. 31, 1976..................................  Feb. 1, 1978.....................                             7
Jan. 31, 1978..................................  Feb. 1, 1980.....................                             6
Jan. 31, 1980..................................  Feb. 1, 1982.....................                            12
Jan. 31, 1982..................................  Jan. 1, 1983.....................                            20
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) On amounts outstanding after December 31, 1982, the adjusted 
rate established by the Commissioner under section 6621(b). This 
adjusted rate shall be published by the Commissioner in a Revenue 
Ruling. See Sec. 301.6622-1 for application of daily compounding in 
determining interest accruing after December 31, 1982. Because interest 
accruing after December 31, 1982, accrues at the prescribed rate per 
annum compounded daily, the effective annual percentage rate of interest 
will exceed the prescribed rate of interest.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Applicability of interest rate--(1) Computation. Interest and 
additions to tax on any amount outstanding on a specific day shall be 
computed at the annual rate applicable on such day.
    (2) Additions to tax. Additions to tax under any section of the Code 
that refers to the annual rate established under this section, including 
sections 644(a)(2)(B), 4497(c)(2), 6654(a), and 6655 (a) and (g), shall 
be computed at the same rate per annum as the interest rate set forth 
under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) Interest. Interest provided for under any section of the Code 
that refers to the annual rate established under this section, including 
sections 47(d)(3)(G), 167(q), 6332(c)(1), 6343(c), 6601(a), 6602, 
6611(a), 7426(g), and section 1961(c)(1) or 2411 of Title 28 of the 
United States Code, shall be computed at the rate per annum set forth 
under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples. Example 6 illustrates the computation of 
interest for interest accuring after December 31, 1982.

    Example 1. A, an individual, files an income tax return for the 
calendar year 1974 on April 15, 1975, showing a tax due of $1,000. A 
pays the $1,000 on September 1, 1975. Pursuant to section 6601(a), 
interest on the underpayment of $1,000 is computed at the rate of 6 
percent per annum from April 15, 1975, to June 30, 1975, a total of 76 
days. Interest for

[[Page 325]]

63 days, from June 30, 1975, to September 1, 1975, shall be computed at 
the rate of 9 percent per annum.
    Example 2. An executor of an estate is granted, in accordance with 
section 6161(a)(2)(A), a two-year extension of time for payment of the 
estate tax shown on the estate tax return, which tax was otherwise due 
on January 15, 1974. The tax is paid on January 15, 1976. Interest on 
the underpayemnt shall be computed at the rate of 4 percent per annum 
from January 15, 1974, to June 30, 1975, and at the rate of 9 percent 
per annum from June 30, 1975, to January 15, 1976.
    Example 3. X, a corporation, files its 1973 corporate income tax 
return on March 15, 1974, and pays the balance of tax due shown thereon. 
On August 1, 1975, an assessment of a deficiency is made against X with 
respect to such tax. The deficiency is paid on October 1, 1975. Interest 
at the rate of 6 percent per annum is due on the deficiency from March 
15, 1974, the due date of the return, to June 30, 1975, and at the rate 
of 9 percent per annum from June 30, 1975, to October 1, 1975.
    Example 4. Y, an individual, files an amended individual income tax 
return on October 1, 1975, for the refund of an overpayment of income 
tax Y made on April 15, 1975. Interest is allowed on the overpayment to 
December 1, 1975. Pursuant to section 6611(a), interest is computed at 
the rate of 6 percent per annum from April 15, 1975, the date of 
overpayment, to June 30, 1975. Interest from June 30, 1975, to December 
1, 1975, shall be computed at the rate of 9 percent per annum.
    Example 5. A, an individual, is liable for an addition to tax under 
section 6654 for the underpayment of estimated tax from April 15, 1975 
until January 15, 1976. The addition to tax shall be computed at the 
annual rate of 6 percent per annum from April 15, 1975, to June 30, 
1975, and at the annual rate of 9 percent per annum from June 30, 1975, 
to January 15, 1976.
    Example 6. B, an individual, files an income tax return for calendar 
year 1980 on April 15, 1981, showing a tax due of $1,000. B pays the 
$1,000 on March 1, 1983. Under section 6601 (a), interest on the $1,000 
underpayment is due from April 15, 1981, to March 1, 1983. Such interest 
is computed at the rate of 12 percent per annum, simple interest from 
April 15, 1981, to January 31, 1982, and at the rate of 20 percent per 
annum, simple interest from January 31, 1982, to December 31, 1982, and 
at the rate of 16 percent per annum, compounded daily, from December 31, 
1982, to March 1, 1983. The total simple interest accrued but unpaid at 
the end of December 31, 1982, is combined with the $1,000 underpayment 
for purposes of determining the amount of daily compounded interest to 
be charged from December 31, 1982, to March 1, 1983.

Sec. 301.6621-2T  Questions and answers relating to the increased rate of interest on substantial underpayments attributable to certain tax motivated 
          transactions (temporary).

    The following questions and answers relate to the increased rate of 
interest on substantial underpayments attributable to certain tax 
motivated transactions as provided in section 6621(d) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954, as added by section 144 of the Tax Reform Act of 
1984 (Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 682):
    Q-1. What is the annual interest rate under section 6621 for 
purposes of computing the amount of interest that must be paid under 
section 6601 (relating to interest on underpayments)?
    A-1. In general, the annual interest rate for purposes of section 
6601 is the adjusted rate of interest established under section 6621 (b) 
Sec. 301.6621-1 (``adjusted rate''). If, however, a tax motivated 
underpayment (as defined in A-2 of this section) for a taxable year is 
substantial (as defined in A-7 of this section), section 6621(d) 
provides that the annual rate of interest with respect to the tax 
motivated underpayment is 120 percent of the adjusted rate (``120 
percent rate''), rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.
    Q-2. What is a tax motivated underpayment?
    A-2. A tax motivated underpayment is the portion of a deficiency (as 
defined in section 6211) of tax imposed by subtitle A (income taxes) 
that is attributable to any of the following tax motivated transactions:
    (1) Any instance in which the value of any property, or the adjusted 
basis of any property, claimed on a return is 150 percent or more of the 
amount determined to be the correct amount of such valuation or adjusted 
basis (i.e., a valuation overstatement within the meaning of section 
6659(c)(1));
    (2) Any loss disallowed for any period by reason of section 465(a) 
or any amount included in gross income by reason of section 465(e);

[[Page 326]]

    (3) Any credit disallowed for any period by reason of section 
46(c)(8) or section 48(d)(6);
    (4) Any loss disallowed for any period with respect to a straddle, 
as defined in section 1092(c), but without regard to sections 1092 (d) 
and (e);
    (5) Any use of an accounting method that may result in a substantial 
distortion of income for any period (see A-3 of this section); and
    (6) Any deduction disallowed with respect to any other tax motivated 
transactions (see A-4 of this section).
    Q-3. What accounting methods may result in a substantial distortion 
of income for any period under A-2(5) of this section?
    A-3. A deduction or credit disallowed, or income included, in any of 
the circumstances listed below shall be treated as attributable to the 
use of an accounting method that may result in a substantial distortion 
of income and shall thus be a tax motivated transaction that results in 
a tax motivated underpayment:
    (1) Any deduction disallowed for any period by reason of section 464 
or section 278(b), relating to certain expenses of farming syndicates;
    (2) In the case of a taxpayer who computes taxable income using the 
cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, any interest 
deduction disallowed for any period by reason of section 461(g), 
relating to prepaid interest, provided the interest is not paid with 
respect to indebtedness incurred in connection with (i) the purchase, 
refinancing, or improvement of the principal residence of the taxpayer, 
or (ii) the purchase of consumer goods by the taxpayer;
    (3) Any interest deduction disallowed for any period because the 
amount of the claimed deduction was computed using a method resulting in 
an amount of interest for a period that exceeds the true cost of the 
indebtedness for the period computed by applying the effective rate of 
interest on the loan to the unpaid balance of the loan for the period 
(i.e., the economic accrual of interest for the period), provided the 
interest is not accrued with respect to indebtedness incurred in 
connection with (i) the purchase, refinancing, or improvement of the 
principal residence of the taxpayer, or (ii) the purchase of consumer 
goods by the taxpayer (see Rev. Rul. 83-84, 1983-1 C.B. 97, and sections 
163(e), 446(b), and 483);
    (4) Any deduction disallowed for any period under section 709, 
relating to organization or syndication expenditures of a partnership;
    (5) In the case of any expenditure described in section 248(b) that 
was incurred by an S corporation, any deduction disallowed because it 
exceeds the amount allowable under section 248, relating to 
organizational expenditures;
    (6) Any deduction disallowed for any period under section 267(a), 
relating to transactions between related taxpayers;
    (7) Any deduction disallowed for any period, or any income required 
to be included for any period, under section 467, relating to certain 
payments for the use of property or services;
    (8) Any deduction disallowed for any period under section 461(i), 
relating to certain deductions of tax shelters; and
    (9) In the case of a taxpayer who computes taxable income using the 
cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, any deduction 
disallowed for any period because (i) the expenditure resulting in the 
deduction was a deposit rather than a payment, (ii) the expenditure was 
prepaid for tax avoidance purposes and not for a business purpose, or 
(iii) the deduction resulted in a material distortion of income (see, 
e.g., Rev. Rul. 79-229, 1979-2 C.B. 210).
    Q-4. Are any transaction other than those specified in A-2 of this 
section and those involving the use of accounting methods under 
circumstances specified in A-3 of this section considered tax motivated 
transactions under A-2(6) of this section?
    A-4. Yes. Deductions disallowed under the following provisions are 
considered to be attributable to tax motivated transactions:
    (1) Any deduction disallowed for any period under section 183, 
relatiing to an activity engaged in by an individual or an S corporation 
that is not engaged in for profit, and
    (2) Any deduction disallowed for any period under section 165(c)(2), 
relating to any transaction not entered into for profit.

[[Page 327]]

    Q-5. How is the amount of a tax motivated underpayment determined?
    A-5. Except as provided in A-6 of this section, the amount of a tax 
motivated underpayment is detemined in the following manner:
    (1) Calculate the amount of the tax liability for the taxable year 
as if all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, had been 
reported properly on the income tax return of the taxpayer (``total tax 
liability''); and
    (2) Without taking into account any adjustments to items of income, 
gain, loss, deduction, or credit that are attributable to tax motivated 
transactions (as defined in A-2 through A-4 of this section), calculate 
the amount of the tax liability for the taxable year as if all other 
items of income, gain loss, deduction, or credit had been reported 
properly on the income tax return of the taxpayer (``tax liability 
without regard to tax motivated transactions'').
    (3) The difference between the total tax liability and the tax 
liability without regard to tax motivated transactions is the amount of 
the tax motivated underpayment.

    Example. Taxpayer A, a calendar year taxpayer, files his 1984 income 
tax return reporting $70,000 of taxable income and $23,171 of tax 
liability. On January 20, 1986, A enters into a closing agreement with 
the Internal Revenue Service that includes the following adjustments;

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
Section 162 deduction disallowed (not tax motivated)..........    $7,500
Loss disallowed under section 465 (tax motivated--see A-2(2)

 overstatement (tax motivated--see A-2(1) of this section)....    10,000
Loss disallowed with respect to a straddle as defined in                
 section 1092(c) (tax motivated--see A-2(4) of this section)..     7,000
Other adjustments (none of which are tax motivated)...........     4,000

2. Reported taxable income....................................    70,000
  (Add adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, deduction,           
   or credit other than those with respect to items that are            
   tax motivated).............................................   +11,500
                                                               ---------
  Tax=$28,691 (``tax liability without regard to tax motivated          
   transactions'')............................................    81,500
                                                               =========
                                                                        

    The tax motivated underpayment (i.e., the underpayment attributable 
to tax motivated transactions) is $10,994 ($39,685-$28,691). 
Accordingly, the interest on $10,994 would be computed at the 120 
percent rate.
    The remainder of the underpayment (i.e., the underpayment not 
attributable to tax motivated transactions) is $5,520 ($28,691 (tax 
liability without regard to tax motivated items)-$23,171 (tax paid with 
return)). The interest on $5,520 would be computed at the adjusted rate.

    Q-6: How are the amounts of the tax motivated underpayment and the 
underpayment attributable to fraud or negligence detemined if all or a 
portion of the taxpayer's underpayment is attributable to one or more 
tax motivated transactions and all or a portion is subject to the 
addition to tax imposed by section 6653(a)(2) (in the case of an 
underpayment attributable to negligence or intentional disregard) or 
section 6653(b)(2) (in the case of an underpayment attributable to 
fraud)?
    A-6: If all or a portion of the taxpayer's underpayment is 
attributable to tax motivated transactions, and all or a portion is 
attributable to fraudulent or negligent items (i.e., items that result 
in an underpayment subject to the addition to tax imposed by section 
6653 (a)(2) or (b)(2)), the amount of the tax motivated underpayment and 
the underpayment attributable to fraud or negligence is determined in 
the following manner:
    (1) Determine the following amounts;
    (i) The tax liability for the taxable year of the taxpayer as if all 
items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit had been reported 
properly on the income tax return of the taxpayer (``total tax 
liability'');
    (ii) The tax liability for the taxable year of the taxpayer as if 
all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit without taking 
into account adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or 
credit that are both (a) attributable to tax motivated transactions and 
(b) subject to section

[[Page 328]]

6653(a)(2) or section 6653(b)(2), had been reported properly on the 
income tax return of the taxpayer (``tax liability without regard to 
fraudulent or negligent tax motivated items'');
    (iii) The tax liability for the taxable year of the taxpayer as if 
all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, without taking 
into account adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or 
credit that are subject to section 6653(a)(2) or section 6653(b)(2), had 
been reported properly on the income tax return of the taxpayer (``tax 
liability without regard to fraudulent or negligent items'');
    (iv) The tax liability for the taxable year of the taxpayer as if 
all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, without taking 
into account adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or 
credit that are either subject to section 6653(a)(2) or section 
6653(b)(2) or attributable to tax motivated transactions, had been 
reported properly on the income tax return of the taxpayer (``tax 
liability without regard to tax motivated or fraudulent or negligent 
items'').
    (2) The tax motivated underpayment attributable to fraudulent or 
negligent items is the excess of the total tax liability over the tax 
liability determined without regard to fraudulent or negligent tax 
motivated items ((i)-(ii)).
    (3) The tax motivated underpayment is the sum of (a) the tax 
motivated underpayment attributable to fraudulent or negligent items 
((i)-(ii)) plus (b) the excess of the tax liability without regard to 
fraudulent or negligent items over the tax liability without regard to 
tax motivated or fraudulent or negligent items ((iii)-(iv)). Interest on 
this underpayment is computed at the 120 percent rate.
    (4) The underpayment attributable to fraudulent or negligent items 
is the excess of the total tax liability over the tax liability without 
regard to fraudulent or negligent items ((i)-(iii)). The section 6653 
addition to tax is 50 percent of the interest on this underpayment 
computed at the 120 percent rate on an amount equal to the tax motivated 
underpayment attributable to fraudulent or negligent items (computed in 
(2)) and at the adjusted rate on the remainder.

    Example. Taxpayer A, a calendar year taxpayer, files his 1984 income 
tax return reporting $70,000 of taxable income and $23,171 of tax 
liability. On January 20, 1986, A enters into a closing agreement with 
the Internal Revenue Service that includes the following adjustments:

 fraudulent or negligent).....................................    $7,500
Loss disallowed under section 465(a) (tax motivated--see A-             
 2(2) of this section--and fraudulent or negligent)...........     5,000
Section 170 deduction disallowed because of a valuation                 
 overstatement (tax motivated--see A-2(1) of this section--but          
 not fraudulent or negligent..................................    10,000
Loss disallowed with respect to a straddle as defined in                
 section 1092(c) (tax motivated--see A-2(4) of this section             
 but not fraudulent or negligent).............................     7,000
Other adjustments (none of which are tax motivated or                   
 fraudulent or negligent).....................................     4,000
                                                                        

    The tax motivated underpayment is determined in the following 
manner:

    (2) The tax motivated underpayment attributable to fraudulent or 
negligent items is $2,500 ((i))-(ii) or $39,685-$37,185).
    (3) The tax motivated underpayment is $10,844 ((2)+((iii)-(iv)) or 
$2,500+($33,435-$25,091)). Interest on $10,844 is computed at the 120 
percent rate.
    (4) The underpayment attributable to fraudulent or negligent items 
is $6,250

[[Page 329]]

((i)-(iii) or $39,685-$33,435). The section 6653 addition to tax is 50 
percent of the interest on $6,250, computed at the 120 percent rate on 
an amount equal to the tax motivated underpayment attributable to 
fraudulent or negligent items ($2,500) and at the adjusted rate on the 
remainder ($3,750).
    (5) In summary, therefore, the total underpayment is $16,514 (total 
tax liability ($39,685) less reported tax liability ($23,171)) of which 
$10,844 accrues interest at the 120 percent rate and $5,670 
($16,514-$10,844) accrues interest at the adjusted rate. In addition, 
$6,250 of the underpayment is subject to the section 6653(a)(2) or 
section 6653(b)(2) addition to tax. The underlying interest, upon which 
the addition to tax is based, is computed using the 120 percent rate for 
the portion of the underpayment subject to section 6621(d) ($2,500) and 
the adjusted rate for the portion that is not subject to section 6621(d) 
($3,750).
    Q-7. Does the 120 percent rate apply to all tax motivated 
underpayments?
    A-7. No. The 120 percent rate applies only if the tax motivated 
underpayment for the taxable year is substantial. A tax motivated 
underpayment is substantial only if it exceeds $1,000. If, for example, 
a taxpayer has a $600 underpayment attributable to a valuation 
overstatement (within the meaning of section 6659(c)(1)) and a $500 
underpayment attributable to a loss disallowed under section 465(a), the 
amount of the tax motivated underpayment is $1,100. Because the amount 
of the tax motivated underpayment is thus substantial the 120 percent 
rate applies.
    Q-8. How do carryovers affect the amount of the tax motivated 
underpayment and the amount of the underpayment attributable to 
fraudulent or negligent items?
    A-8. For purposes of A-5 and A-6 of this section, a net operating 
loss carryover, capital loss carryover, or credit carryover is treated 
as a deduction or credit in the year in which taken into account. In any 
computation of tax liability required under A-5 or A-6 of this section 
(i.e., total tax liability, tax liability without regard to tax 
motivated transactions, etc.), the amount of such deduction or credit is 
the amount of the carryover determined as if the taxpayer had properly 
reported in each taxable year all items of income, gain, loss, 
deduction, or credit affecting the amount of the carryover other than 
adjustments of a type not taken into account in such computation of tax 
liability. A net operating loss carryback, capital loss carryback, or 
credit carryback is not taken into account, however, in determining the 
amount of the tax motivated underpayment or the amount of the 
underpayment attributable to fraud or negligence for periods before the 
last date prescribed for filing the income tax return for the taxable 
year in which the carryback arises (determined without regard to 
extensions).
    Q-9. What amount is subject to the 120 percent rate if the amount of 
a taxpayer's unpaid tax for a year is less than the taxpayer's 
substantial tax motivated underpayment?
    A-9. The 120 percent rate applies with respect to the lesser of--
    (1) The amount of unpaid tax for the taxable year determined in 
accordance with Sec. 301.6601-1; or
    (2) The substantial tax motivated underpayment for the taxable year.
    Q-10. What is the effective date for the 120 percent rate?
    A-10. The 120 percent rate applies to interest accruing on a 
deficiency attributable to a substantial tax motivated underpayment 
after December 31, 1984, including interest accruing with respect to 
transactions described in A-3 and A-4 of this section, regardless of the 
date prescribed for payment of the tax.

    Example. Taxpayer A files his income tax return on April 15, 1983 
(the last date prescribed for payment of tax for taxable year 1982 under 
section 6601). In January 1985, Taxpayer A files a petition in the Tax 
Court in response to a statutory notice of deficiency for taxable year 
1982, which includes a tax motivated underpayment of $10,000. In 
September 1986, the Tax Court enters a decision for the Internal Revenue 
Service. Under section 6601, interest accrues at the adjusted rate, 
compounded daily, on tax motivated underpayments outstanding before 
January 1, 1985, and at the 120 percent rate, compounded daily, on 
amounts outstanding after December 31, 1984. The underpayment that is 
subject to the 120 percent rate includes both the $10,000 tax motivated 
underpayment and the interest that accrued on

[[Page 330]]

the underpayment at the adjusted rate from April 16, 1983, through 
December 31, 1984.

    Q-11. Can a taxpayer stop the running of interest on a tax motivated 
underpayment by application of a remittance?
    A-11. Yes. The running of interest on a tax liability stops on the 
date the remittance (either a payment of tax or a deposit in the nature 
of a cash bond) is received by the Internal Revenue Service, regardless 
of when the liability is assessed or the remittance is actually applied 
against the taxpayer's account. A taxpayer must make a remittance for 
both the tax liability and the interest that has accrued as of the date 
of remittance to stop the running of interest on both the tax liability 
and the accrued interest with respect to the liability. (See Rev. Proc. 
84-58.) Taxpayer cannot make partial remittances applicable only to tax 
motivated underpayments. Under A-9 of this section, the 120 percent rate 
applies to the amount of unpaid tax to the extent that amount does not 
exceed the tax motivated underpayment. Therefore, a partial remittance 
is applied first to any tax due that is not attributable to a tax 
motivated underpayment. The excess of the partial remittance over tax 
that is not attributable to a tax motivated underpayment, if any, will 
then be applied to tax due that is attributable to a tax motivated 
underpayment.
    Q-12. Does the 120 percent rate apply to interest accruing on 
interest, penalties, additional amounts, or additions to tax as provided 
in section 6601(e)(2)?
    A-12. The 120 percent rate applies only to taxes imposed by subtitle 
A (income taxes) and to interest accrued with respect to such taxes. The 
penalties, additional amounts, and additions to tax specified in section 
6601(e)(2) are not imposed by subtitle A and are not, therefore, 
included in the amount of a tax motivated underpayment. They are, 
however, included in the amount of unpaid tax for purposes of A-9 of 
this section.

    Example. Taxpayer A, for taxable year 1984, has a $10,000 tax 
motivated underpayment and a $2,000 addition to tax for a total unpaid 
tax of $12,000. If A makes a $5,000 payment of tax, he will still have a 
$10,000 tax motivated underpayment but will now have only $7,000 of 
unpaid tax. Pursuant to A-9 of this section, therefore, the 120 percent 
rate would apply to the $7,000 of unpaid tax.

[T.D. 7998, 49 FR 50391, Dec. 28, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6621-3  Higher interest rate payable on large corporate underpayments.

    (a) In general. Section 6621 establishes the interest rate for 
purposes of computing the amount of interest that must be paid under 
section 6601, relating to interest on underpayments of tax. Section 
6621(a)(2) provides that the underpayment rate is the sum of the Federal 
short-term rate (determined under section 6621(b)) plus 3 percentage 
points. That underpayment rate is referred to hereinafter as the 
``section 6621(a)(2) rate.'' Section 6621(c) and this section, however, 
provide that the underpayment rate on any large corporate underpayment 
is the sum of the Federal short-term rate (determined under section 
6621(b)) plus 5 percentage points. This higher underpayment rate is 
referred to hereinafter as the ``section 6621(c) rate.'' The section 
6621(c) rate applies only for periods after the applicable date (as 
determined in paragraph (c) of this section).
    (b) Large corporate underpayment--(1) Defined. For purposes of 
section 6621(c) and this section, ``large corporate underpayment'' means 
any underpayment of a tax by a C corporation for any taxable period if 
the amount of the threshold underpayment of the tax (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) for that taxable period exceeds 
$100,000.
    (2) Underpayment of a tax--(i) In general. As used in section 
6621(c) and this section, ``underpayment of a tax'' means the excess of 
a tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code over the amount of such tax 
paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, ``tax'' for such 
purposes includes interest, penalties, additional amounts, and additions 
to tax. See sections 6601(e)(1), 6665(a), and 6671(a). Thus, the section 
6621(c) rate

[[Page 331]]

generally applies to any interest, penalties, additional amounts, and 
additions to tax, as well as to the underlying tax with respect to which 
such amounts are imposed.
    (ii) Threshold underpayment of a tax. Solely for purposes of this 
section and not for any other purpose under section 6621(c) or elsewhere 
in the interpretation or administration of the federal tax laws, a 
``threshold underpayment of a tax'' is the excess of a tax imposed by 
the Internal Revenue Code (exclusive of interest, penalties, additional 
amounts, and additions to tax) for the taxable period over the amount of 
such tax paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment. Thus, 
any payments made after the last date prescribed for payment (for 
example, by way of an amended return) will not affect the existence of a 
threshold underpayment. In determining whether there is a threshold 
underpayment, different types of taxes (such as income tax and FICA tax) 
and amounts that relate to different taxable periods are not added 
together.
    (iii) When determined--(A) In general. The existence of a threshold 
underpayment of a tax and the amount of a large corporate underpayment 
are generally determined only when an assessment is made with respect to 
the taxable period. Thus, the amount of a deficiency or proposed 
deficiency set forth in a letter or notice pursuant to which the 
applicable date is determined (under paragraph (c) of this section) does 
not determine whether there is a large corporate underpayment.
    (B) Judicial determinations. Notwithstanding any prior assessment 
made with respect to a taxable period, the section 6621(c) rate does not 
apply if, after a federal court determines the taxpayer's liability for 
a period, the threshold underpayment for that taxable period does not 
exceed $100,000. See Example 3 in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iv) Special rule. The section 6621(c) rate is not used to compute 
the interest charges that a taxpayer timely assesses against itself in 
return for using a method of tax accounting or reporting that defers the 
payment of tax, such as the interest charges relating to passive foreign 
investment companies under section 1291(c) and installment obligations 
of nondealers under section 453A(c). However, to the extent such charges 
are not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment and 
therefore become part of an underpayment of a tax, the section 6621(c) 
rate will apply to such amounts for periods after the applicable date 
(as determined in paragraph (c) of this section).
    (3) C corporation defined. For purposes of section 6621(c)(3)(A) and 
this section, ``C corporation'' means, with respect to any taxable 
period, a corporation that is a C corporation during any part of the 
taxable period. Interest on a large corporate underpayment for a taxable 
period continues to be imposed at the section 6621(c) rate even if 
during or after the taxable period--
    (i) The taxpayer ceases to be a C corporation; or
    (ii) The underpayment becomes the liability of a successor or 
transferee that is not a C corporation.
    (4) Taxable period. For purposes of section 6621(c) and this 
section, the ``taxable period'' is the taxable year in the case of any 
tax imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. In the case of 
any other tax, the ``taxable period'' is the period to which the 
underpayment relates. For example, the taxable period for an 
underpayment of FICA taxes is the calendar quarter. If the underpayment 
does not relate to a particular period (for example, in the case of 
certain transactional excise taxes), the ``taxable period'' is the 
period covered by a return on which the tax is required to be shown.
    (5) Last date prescribed for payment. For purposes of this section, 
the ``last date prescribed for payment'' means the last date prescribed 
for payment as determined, without regard to any extension of time, 
under section 6601(b).
    (c) Applicable date--(1) In general. The section 6621(c) rate 
applies only to periods after the applicable date. Pursuant to the 
effective date of section 6621(c) and paragraph (e) of this section, 
however, the section 6621(c) rate will not apply prior to January 1, 
1991, even if the applicable date is prior to December 31, 1990. A 
letter or notice relating to a particular type of tax creates an 
applicable date only for that type of tax. For example, a letter or 
notice

[[Page 332]]

with respect to FUTA tax will not create an applicable date with respect 
to income tax for the same taxable year.
    (2) When deficiency procedures apply. The applicable date, in the 
case of any underpayment of a tax to which the deficiency procedures of 
subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code apply, is the 
30th day after the earlier of--
    (i) The date on which the Service sends the taxpayer the first 
letter of proposed deficiency that allows the taxpayer an opportunity 
for administrative review in the Service's Office of Appeals (commonly 
called a ``30-day letter''); or
    (ii) The date on which the Service sends a deficiency notice under 
section 6212 of the Internal Revenue Code (commonly called a ``90-day 
letter'').
    (3) When deficiency procedures do not apply. The applicable date, in 
the case of any underpayment of a tax to which the deficiency procedures 
do not apply, is the 30th day after the date on which the Service sends 
the first letter or notice that notifies the taxpayer of an assessment 
or proposed assessment of the tax. In the case of income taxes, for 
example, the deficiency procedures do not apply to amounts shown as due 
on the taxpayer's return if the taxpayer fails to remit the full amount 
on or before the last date prescribed for payment, and to amounts 
attributable to mathematical or clerical errors on a return (unless a 
request for abatement is filed by the taxpayer under section 6213(b)). 
Because no 30-day letter or 90-day letter is issued to the taxpayer in 
such cases, the applicable date is the 30th day after the date on which 
an assessment notice under section 6303 of the Internal Revenue Code is 
sent.
    (4) Partnership items. For purposes of section 6621(c) and this 
paragraph (c), 60-day letters and the notices described in sections 
6223(a)(1) and 6223(a)(2) (relating to administrative proceedings at the 
partnership level) are not treated as letters of proposed deficiency 
that allow the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the 
Service's Office of Appeals, deficiency notices under section 6212 of 
the Internal Revenue Code, or letters or notices that notify the 
taxpayer of an assessment or proposed assessment of the tax. Thus, in 
the absence of any other letter or notice described in paragraph (c)(2) 
or (c)(3) of this section that establishes an earlier applicable date, 
the applicable date in the case of any underpayment of a tax 
attributable, in whole or in part, to a partnership item (as defined in 
section 6231(a)(3)) is the 30th day after the date on which the Service 
sends the first letter or notice that notifies the taxpayer of an 
assessment of the tax.
    (5) Exception of payment of amount shown as due--(i) In general. A 
letter of notice will be disregarded for purposes of determining the 
applicable date if the taxpayer makes a payment equal to the amount 
shown as due in the letter or notice within 30 days from the date that 
the Service sends the letter or notice.
    (ii) Special transition rule. A letter or notice sent by the Service 
prior to January 1, 1991, will be disregarded by the Service for 
purposes of determining the applicable date if the taxpayer makes a 
payment on or before January 31, 1991, equal to the amount shown as due 
in the letter or notice plus a reasonable estimate of the interest 
payable on such amount computed by applying the section 6621(a)(2) rate. 
If the taxpayer has received two or more letters or notices with respect 
to the same tax for the same taxable period and pays the amount shown as 
due in the last letter or notice sent prior to December 19, 1990, (plus 
a reasonable estimate of the interest), all of the prior letters and 
notices with respect to the same tax for the same taxable period will be 
disregarded under this paragraph (c)(5)(ii). In the case of an 
assessment notice, the payment of the amount of interest shown as due on 
the last assessment notice sent to the taxpayer prior to December 19, 
1990, will be treated as a payment of a reasonable estimate of the 
interest payable on the amount shown in that assessment notice or in any 
prior assessment notice sent with respect to the same tax for the same 
taxable period. The special transition rule in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) 
applies even if the payment is not made within 30 days of the date on 
which the Service sent the letter or notice.
    (iii) Amount shown as due. For purposes of section 6621(c)(2)(B)(ii) 
and

[[Page 333]]

this paragraph (c)(5), the ``amount shown as due'' in any letter or 
notice means the total amount of tax, as well as any interest, 
penalties, additional amounts, and additions to tax that are set forth 
in the letter or notice. A deposit in the nature of a cash bond will not 
be considered a payment of the amount shown as due.
    (6) Exception for withdrawn letters and notices--(i) Letters of 
proposed deficiency. A letter of proposed deficiency will be disregarded 
for purposes of determining the applicable date if the letter of 
proposed deficiency is issued as a result of an administrative error 
either to the wrong taxpayer or for the wrong taxable period.
    (ii) Deficiency notices. A deficiency notice under section 6212 of 
the Internal Revenue Code will be disregarded for purposes of 
determining the applicable date if the deficiency notice is rescinded 
under section 6212(d).
    (iii) Assessment letters and notices. A letter or notice that 
notifies the taxpayer of an assessment or proposed assessment of tax 
will be disregarded for purposes of determining the applicable date if 
the full amount of tax assessed is subsequently abated.
    (d) Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples.

    Example 1. V, a C corporation, timely files Form 941 on January 31, 
1991, for the fourth quarter of 1990. On September 1, 1992, the Service 
sends V a section 6303 notice and demand reflecting an additional FICA 
tax liability for that quarter of $90,000. Interest computed at the 
section 6621(a)(2) rate totals $15,000 as of September 1, 1992. 
Accordingly, V's underpayment of FICA tax for the fourth quarter of 1990 
exceeds $100,000. However, V's $90,000 threshold underpayment of FICA 
tax for that taxable period is less than $100,000, so that the section 
6621(c) rate will not apply to the underpayment for that taxable period.
    Example 2. (i) W, a C corporation, timely files its 1990 income tax 
return on March 15, 1991, showing a liability of $95,000, of which W 
pays only $35,000 with the return. On June 1, 1991, the Service sends W 
an assessment notice reflecting the balance due of $60,000 plus interest 
computed at the section 6621(a)(2) rate. W pays all amounts due on 
August 1, 1991. On July 1, 1993, the Service sends W a 90-day letter 
(without having sent a 30-day letter) reflecting an additional income 
tax deficiency of $85,000 for the taxable year 1990. W files a petition 
in the Tax Court within 90 days. In 1995, the Tax Court determines a 
$50,000 income tax deficiency (exclusive of interest, penalties, 
additional amounts, and additions to tax) for 1990, which the Service 
promptly assesses against W.
    (ii) As a result of the combination of the failure to timely pay the 
$60,000 of income tax reported as due on the return and the Tax Court's 
determination of an additional deficiency of $50,000, W's threshold 
underpayment of income tax for 1990 is $110,000. Because W is a C 
corporation and the threshold underpayment for 1990 exceeds $100,000, 
the section 6621(c) rate applies to W's 1990 large corporate 
underpayment for periods after the applicable date.
    (iii) The applicable date is July 1, 1991, the 30th day after the 
date on which the Service sent W the first assessment notice.
    (iv) From March 16, 1991, through July 1, 1991, interest on W's 1990 
underpayment of income tax (including any interest, penalties, 
additional amounts, and additions to tax) is computed at the section 
6621(a)(2) rate. From July 2, 1991, such interest is computed at the 
section 6621(c) rate.
    (v) If W had paid the amount shown as due on the June 1, 1991, 
assessment notice on or before June 30, 1991, instead of on August 1, 
1991, the applicable date would have been July 31, 1993.
    (vi) Assume that W had paid the amount shown as due on the June 1, 
1991, assessment notice on or before June 30, 1991. If W had made a 
$40,000 deposit in the nature of a cash bond on July 15, 1993, the 
applicable date would be July 31, 1993. Moreover, the deposit would have 
no effect on the existence or amount of W's threshold underpayment or 
large corporate underpayment for 1990. In such a case, however, when the 
Service assesses the amount due from W in 1995, the deposit would be 
treated as a payment made as of July 15, 1993, for purposes of computing 
interest due after that date. As a result, interest would accrue after 
July 15, 1993, (at the section 6621(c) rate) only on the portion of W's 
1990 underpayment that exceeds the $40,000 deposit amount.
    Example 3. (i) X, a C corporation, filed its 1989 income tax return 
,on September 17, 1990, pursuant to an automatic extension. X enclosed 
payment of the $7,500 balance reported on the return as due (plus 
interest). On January 1, 1992, the Service sends X a written 
notification that X's 1989 income tax return is being examined. This 
written notification also contains a request that X provide supplemental 
information with respect to particular deductions totalling $1.5 
million. On July 1, 1993, the Service sends X a 30-day letter proposing 
a $450,000 deficiency (without any reference to penalties, additional 
amounts, additions to tax, and interest) with respect to 1989. On 
December 15, 1993, the Service sends X a 90-day letter asserting a 
deficiency of $300,000 (excluding

[[Page 334]]

penalties, additional amounts, additions to tax, and other interest). X 
does not file a Tax Court petition and the Service assesses the $300,000 
(plus interest and penalties) on April 1, 1994. On April 5, 1994, X pays 
the full amount assessed. Thereafter, X timely files an administrative 
claim for refund and a refund suit in federal district court for the 
amounts assessed on April 1, 1994. On September 30, 1995, the federal 
district court determines that, exclusive of interest and penalties, X 
overpaid its 1989 income tax by $250,000.
    (ii) The April 1, 1994, assessment establishes at that time that X's 
threshold underpayment of income tax for 1989 is $300,000. Because X is 
a C corporation and the threshold underpayment for 1989 exceeds 
$100,000, X's underpayment of income tax for 1989 is a large corporate 
underpayment to which the section 6621(c) rate applies for periods after 
the applicable date. X's decision to file a refund claim does not 
affect, in and of itself, either the existence of a threshold 
underpayment or the amount of X's large corporate underpayment.
    (iii) For purposes of determining the amount of interest to assess 
on April 1, 1994, the applicable date is July 31, 1993, the 30th day 
after the date on which the Service sent X a 30-day letter. The January 
1, 1992, notice of examination and request for additional information 
has no effect on the applicable date. Similarly, the September 30, 1995, 
federal district court decision has no effect on the applicable date.
    (iv) From March 16, 1990, through July 31, 1993, interest on X's 
1989 underpayment of income tax (including any interest, penalties, 
additional amounts, and additions to tax) is computed at the section 
6621(a)(2) rate. From August 1, 1993, through April 5, 1994, such 
interest is computed at the section 6621(c) rate.
    (v) Because of the federal district court's decision that X's 
underpayment, exclusive of interest and penalties, was only $50,000, X 
does not have a large corporate underpayment of income tax for 1989. 
Thus, the interest X paid with respect to the remaining $250,000 in 
taxes (exclusive of interest and penalties) becomes part of the 
overpayment and will be refunded. In addition, any interest computed at 
the section 6621(c) rate for the period from August 1, 1993, through 
April 5, 1994, should be recomputed at the section 6621(a)(2) rate and 
the difference refunded.
    Example 4. (i) Y, a C corporation, timely filed its 1989 income tax 
return on March 15, 1990, and enclosed payment of the amount reported on 
the return as due. On May 1, 1990, the Service sent to Y an assessment 
notice for $1,000 resulting from a math error on Y's return. Y did not 
request an abatement of the assessment pursuant to section 6213(b). 
Instead, Y paid the $1,000, plus interest, on July 31, 1990. On March 
31, 1992, the Service sends Y a 90-day letter showing an income tax 
deficiency for 1989 of $125,000 (exclusive of interest, penalties, 
additional amounts, and additions to tax). No 30-day letter had been 
issued previously to Y in connection with its 1989 taxable year. Y does 
not file a petition with the Tax Court, but files an amended return for 
1989 on April 15, 1992, showing $30,000 of tax due. Y pays this amount 
(plus interest from March 15, 1990, computed at the section 6621(a)(2) 
rate) with the amended return. Shortly thereafter, the Service assesses 
the $125,000 deficiency (plus interest) and credits the April 15, 1992, 
payment against the assessment.
    (ii) Y's threshold underpayment for 1989 is $125,000 notwithstanding 
Y's April 15, 1992, payment of $30,000. Because Y is a C corporation and 
the threshold underpayment for 1989 exceeds $100,000, Y has a large 
corporate underpayment of income tax for the taxable period 1989 to 
which the section 6621(c) rate applies for periods after the applicable 
date.
    (iii) Because Y paid the $1,000 amount shown as due on the math 
error assessment notice (plus interest) on or before January 31, 1991, 
the applicable date is April 30, 1992, the 30th day after the 90-day 
letter is sent.
    (iv) From March 16, 1990, through April 30, 1992, interest is 
computed on Y's underpayment of income tax (including any interest, 
penalties, additional amounts, and additions to tax) at the section 
6621(a)(2) rate. From May 1, 1992, such interest is computed at the 
section 6621(c) rate.
    (v) If Y had not paid the $1,000 amount shown as due on the math 
error assessment notice (plus interest) on or before January 31, 1991, 
the applicable date would have been May 31, 1990, and interest would be 
computed at the section 6621(c) rate beginning on January 1, 1991. If, 
however, Y had timely requested an abatement of the assessment under 
section 6213(b), the applicable date would be April 30, 1992.
    Example 5. (i) Effective January 1, 1993, Y converts from a C 
corporation to an S corporation. On January 31, 1993 Y files its 1992 
FUTA tax return and encloses a payment equal to the amount reported as 
due on the return. On March 15, 1993, Y files its 1992 income tax return 
and encloses a payment equal to the amount reported as due on the 
return. On August 1, 1993, the Service sends to Y an assessment notice 
for $150,000 of FUTA tax, plus interest, with respect to calendar year 
1992. Y pays the full amount shown as due in the assessment notice on 
August 7, 1993. On January 1, 1995, Y files an amended income tax return 
for 1992 showing $15,000 of tax due. Y pays this amount with the amended 
return. On February 10, 1995, the Service sends Y an assessment notice 
for the interest payable on the $15,000. Y pays this interest on 
February 13, 1995.
    (ii) Y's threshold underpayment of FUTA tax for 1992 is $150,000. 
Because Y was a C

[[Page 335]]

corporation in 1992 and the threshold underpayment of FUTA tax for 1992 
exceeds $100,000, Y has a large corporate underpayment of FUTA tax. 
However, Y's threshold underpayment of income tax for the same taxable 
period (i.e., calendar 1992) is $15,000, so that Y does not have a large 
corporate underpayment of income tax for that year.
    (iii) Because Y pays within 30 days the amount shown as due on the 
August 1, 1993, assessment notice, there is no applicable date with 
respect to the large corporate underpayment of FUTA tax for 1992.
    (iv) All of the interest payable with respect to the 1992 
underpayments of FUTA and income taxes is computed at the section 
6621(a)(2) rate.
    (v) If Y had not paid the amount shown as due on the August 1, 1993, 
FUTA tax assessment notice within 30 days, the applicable date would 
have been August 31, 1993, (the 30th day after the assessment notice is 
sent). Thus, interest would have been computed at the section 6621(c) 
rate after that date, even though Y is not at that time a C corporation.
    (vi) If the amended 1992 income tax return Y files on January 1, 
1995, had shown $115,000 of tax due instead of $15,000, Y's threshold 
underpayment of income tax for 1992 would have been $115,000. Because Y 
was a C corporation in 1992 and the threshold underpayment of income tax 
for that year would have exceeded $100,000, Y would have a large 
corporate underpayment of income tax for that year. However, because Y 
would have paid the amount shown as due in the February 10, 1995, 
assessment notice within 30 days of when that assessment notice was 
sent, there would have been no applicable date with respect to that 
large corporate underpayment and the section 6621(c) rate would have not 
applied.
    Example 6. (i) On August 1, 1990, the Service sent to Z, a C 
corporation, an assessment notice for $200,000 of income tax, plus 
$30,000 in interest and penalties, with respect to calendar year 1988. 
Subsequent assessment notices were sent to Z on September 12, 1990, 
October 10, 1990, and November 14, 1990, each including additional 
interest. The November 14, 1990, assessment notice provided that the 
total amount of tax, interest and penalties due was $242,000. On 
December 31, 1990, Z pays $230,000. On February 13, 1991, the Service 
sends Z an assessment notice for the remaining balance (plus additional 
interest thereon). On December 31, 1991, Z pays all amounts owed as of 
that date in connection with its 1988 income tax liability.
    (ii) Z's threshold underpayment of income tax for 1988 is $200,000. 
Because Z is a C corporation and its threshold underpayment of income 
tax for 1988 exceeds $100,000, Z has a large corporate underpayment for 
1988 to which the section 6621(c) rate applies for periods after the 
applicable date.
    (iii) Notwithstanding Z's payment of $230,000 on December 31, 1990, 
the applicable date with respect to the large corporate underpayment of 
1988 income tax is August 31, 1990, the 30th day after the date on which 
the Service sent the first assessment notice.
    (iv) From March 16, 1989, to December 31, 1990, interest is computed 
on Z's underpayment of income tax (including any interest, penalties, 
additional amounts and additions to tax) at the section 6621(a)(2) rate. 
From January 1, 1991, through December 31, 1991, interest is computed on 
that underpayment at the section 6621(c) rate.
    (v) If Z had paid on or before January 31, 1991, the full $242,000 
shown as due on the November 14, 1990, assessment notice, the applicable 
date with respect to any remaining unpaid interest would have been March 
15, 1991, the 30th day after the Service sent the February 13, 1991, 
assessment notice.
    (vi) The same result as in paragraph (v) of this Example 6 would 
apply if the November 14, 1990, assessment notice had provided that only 
$150,000 was due with respect to calendar year 1988 (as a result of a 
correction by the Service of an error in its original August 1, 1990, 
assessment, and not as a result of any payment by Z), and if Z had paid 
that $150,000 on or before January 31, 1991.

    (e) Effective date. Section 6621(c) and this section are effective 
for determining interest for periods after December 31, 1990, regardless 
of the taxable period to which the underlying tax may relate and even if 
the applicable date is prior to December 31, 1990.

Sec. 301.6622-1  Interest compounded daily.

    (a) General rule. Effective for interest accruing after December 31, 
1982, in computing the amount of any interest required to be paid under 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or sections 1961(c)(1) or 2411 of 
Title 28, United States Code, by the Commissioner or by the taxpayer, or 
in computing any other amount determined by reference to such amount of 
interest, or by reference to the interest rate established under section 
6621, such interest or such other amount shall be compounded daily by 
dividing such rate of interest by 365 (366 in a leap year) and 
compounding such daily interest rate each day.
    (b) Exception. Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply for 
purposes of

[[Page 336]]

determining the amount of any addition to tax under sections 6654 or 
6655 (relating to failure to pay estimated income tax).
    (c) Applicability to unpaid amounts on December 31, 1982--(1) In 
general. The unpaid interest (or other amount) that shall be compounded 
daily includes the interest (or other amount) accrued but unpaid on 
December 31, 1982.
    (2) Illustration. The provisions of this (c) may be illustrated by 
the following example.

    Example. Individual A files a tax return for calendar year 1981 on 
April 15, 1982, showing a tax due of $10,000. A pays $10,000 on December 
31, 1982, but A does not pay any interest with respect to this 
underpayment until March 1, 1983, on which date A paid all amounts of 
interest with respect to the $10,000 underpayment of tax. On December 
31, 1982, A's unsatisfied interest liability was $1,424.66 ($10,000  x  
20 percent  x  260/365 days). Interest, compounded daily, accrues on 
this unsatisfied interest obligation beginning on January 1, 1983, until 
March 1, 1983, the date the total interest obligation is satisfied. On 
March 1, 1983, the total interest obligation is $1,462.62, computed as 
follows:

               Additions to the Tax and Additional Amounts


<R05>
Sec. 301.6651-1   Failure to file tax return or to pay tax.

    (a) Addition to the tax--(1) Failure to file tax return. In case of 
failure to file a return required under authority of--
    (i) Subchapter A, chapter 61 of the Code, relating to returns and 
records (other than sections 6015 and 6016, relating to declarations of 
estimated tax, and part III thereof, relating to information returns);
    (ii) Subchapter A, chapter 51 of the Code, relating to distilled 
spirits, wines, and beer;
    (iii) Subchapter A, chapter 52 of the Code, relating to cigars, 
cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes; or
    (iv) Subchapter A, chapter 53 of the Code, relating to machine guns, 
destructive devices, and certain other firearms; and

The regulations thereunder, on or before the date prescribed for filing 
(determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing), there 
shall be added to the tax required to be shown on the return the amount 
specified below unless the failure to file the return within the 
prescribed time is shown to the satisfaction of the district director or 
the director of the service center to be due to reasonable cause and not 
to willful neglect. The amount to be added to the tax is 5 percent 
thereof if the failure is for not more than 1 month, with an additional 
5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the 
failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate. The 
amount of any addition under this subparagraph shall be reduced by the 
amount of the addition under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for any 
month to which an addition to tax applies under both subparagraphs (1) 
and (2) of this paragraph (a).
    (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay 
the amount shown as tax on any return (required to be filed after 
December 31, 1969, without regard to any extension of time for filing 
thereof) specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), on or 
before the date prescribed for payment of such tax (determined with 
regard to any extension of time for payment), there shall be added to 
the tax shown on the return the amount specified below unless the 
failure to pay the tax within the prescribed time is shown to the 
satisfaction of the district director, or, as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Assistant Regional Commissioner (Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms), the director of the service center, to be due to 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The amount to

[[Page 337]]

be added to the tax is 0.5 percent of the amount of tax shown on the 
return if the failure is for not more than 1 month, with an additional 
0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which 
the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate.
    (3) Failure to pay tax not shown on return. In case of failure to 
pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return 
specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), which is not so 
shown (including an assessment made pursuant to section 6213(b)) within 
10 days from the date of the notice and demand therefor (if such notice 
and demand is made after December 31, 1969), there shall be added to the 
amount stated in the notice and demand the amount specified below unless 
the failure to pay the tax within the prescribed time is shown to the 
satisfaction of the district director or the director of the service 
center to be due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The 
amount to be added to the tax is 0.5 percent of the amount stated in the 
notice and demand if the failure is for not more than 1 month, with an 
additional 0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof 
during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the 
aggregate, be reduced by the amount of the addition permitted under this 
subparagraph shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), which is attributable to the tax 
for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within 10 
days from the date of notice and demand.
    (b) Month defined. (1) If the date prescribed for filing the return 
or paying tax is the last day of a calendar month, each succeeding 
calendar month or fraction thereof during which the failure to file or 
pay tax continues shall constitute a month for purposes of section 6651.
    (2) If the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax is a 
date other than the last day of a calendar month, the period which 
terminates with the date numerically corresponding thereto in the 
succeeding calendar month and each such successive period shall 
constitute a month for purposes of section 6651. If, in the month of 
February, there is no date corresponding to the date prescribed for 
filing the return or paying tax, the period from such date in January 
through the last day of February shall constitute a month for purposes 
of section 6651. Thus, if a return is due on January 30, the first month 
shall end on February 28 (or 29 if a leap year), and the succeeding 
months shall end on March 30, April 30, etc.
    (3) If a return is not timely filed or tax is not timely paid, the 
fact that the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax, or 
the corresponding date in any succeeding calendar month, falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday is immaterial in determining the 
number of months for which the addition to the tax under section 6651 
applies.
    (c) Showing of reasonable cause. (1) Except as provided in 
subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer who wishes 
to avoid the addition to the tax for failure to file a tax return or pay 
tax must make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged as a 
reasonable cause for his failure to file such return or pay such tax on 
time in the form of a written statement containing a declaration that it 
is made under penalties of perjury. Such statement should be filed with 
the district director or the director of the service center with whom 
the return is required to be filed; Provided, That where special tax 
returns of liquor dealers are delivered to an alcohol, tobacco and 
firearms officer working under the supervision of the Regional Director, 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, such statement may be delivered 
with the return. If the district director, the director of the service 
center, or, where applicable, the Regional Director, Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, determines that the delinquency was due to a 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the addition to the tax 
will not be assessed. If the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care 
and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the 
prescribed time, then the delay is due to a reasonable cause. A failure 
to pay will be considered to be due to reasonable cause to the extent 
that the taxpayer has made

[[Page 338]]

a satisfactory showing that he exercised ordinary business care and 
prudence in providing for payment of his tax liability and was 
nevertheless either unable to pay the tax or would suffer an undue 
hardship (as described in Sec. 1.6161-1(b) of this chapter) if he paid 
on the due date. In determining whether the taxpayer was unable to pay 
the tax in spite of the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence 
in providing for payment of his tax liability, consideration will be 
given to all the facts and circumstances of the taxpayer's financial 
situation, including the amount and nature of the taxpayer's 
expenditures in light of the income (or other amounts) he could, at the 
time of such expenditures, reasonably expect to receive prior to the 
date prescribed for the payment of the tax. Thus, for example, a 
taxpayer who incurs lavish or extravagant living expenses in an amount 
such that the remainder of his assets and anticipated income will be 
insufficient to pay his tax, has not exercised ordinary business care 
and prudence in providing for the payment of his tax liability. Further, 
a taxpayer who invests funds in speculative or illiquid assets has not 
exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for the 
payment of his tax liability unless, at the time of the investment, the 
remainder of the taxpayer's assets and estimated income will be 
sufficient to pay his tax or it can be reasonably foreseen that the 
speculative or illiquid investment made by the taxpayer can be utilized 
(by sale or as security for a loan) to realize sufficient funds to 
satisfy the tax liability. A taxpayer will be considered to have 
exercised ordinary business care and prudence if he made reasonable 
efforts to conserve sufficient assets in marketable form to satisfy his 
tax liability and nevertheless was unable to pay all or a portion of the 
tax when it became due.
    (2) In determining if the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care 
and prudence in providing for the payment of his tax liability, 
consideration will be given to the nature of the tax which the taxpayer 
has failed to pay. Thus, for example, facts and circumstances which, 
because of the taxpayer's efforts to conserve assets in marketable form, 
may constitute reasonable cause for nonpayment of income taxes may not 
constitute reasonable cause for failure to pay over taxes described in 
section 7501 that are collected or withheld from any other person.
    (3) If, for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1995, an 
individual taxpayer satisfies the requirement of Sec. 1.6081-4(a) of 
this chapter (relating to automatic extension of time for filing an 
individual income tax return), reasonable cause will be presumed, for 
the period of the extension of time to file, with respect to any 
underpayment of tax if--
    (i) The excess of the amount of tax shown on the individual income 
tax return over the amount of tax paid on or before the regular due date 
of the return (by virtue of tax withheld by the employer, estimated tax 
payments, and any payment with an application for extension of time to 
file pursuant to Sec. 1.6081-4 of this chapter) is no greater than 10 
percent of the amount of tax shown on the individual income tax return; 
and
    (ii) Any balance due shown on the individual income tax return is 
remitted with the return.
    (4) If, for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1972, a 
corporate taxpayer satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.6081-3 (a) or 
(b) (relating to an automatic extension of time for filing a corporation 
income tax return), reasonable cause shall be presumed, for the period 
of the extension of time to file, with respect to any underpayment of 
tax if--
    (i) Not less than the amount of tax that would be required as the 
first installment under section 6152(a)(1), if the taxpayer elected to 
pay the tax in installments, is paid on or before the regular due date 
of the return and the second installment is paid on or before 3 months 
after such date,
    (ii) The amount of tax (determined without regard to any prepayment 
thereof) shown on Form 7004, or the amount of tax paid on or before the 
regular due date of the return, is at least 90 percent of the amount of 
tax shown on the taxpayer's Form 1120, and
    (iii) Any balance due shown on the Form 1120 is paid on, or before 
the due

[[Page 339]]

date of the return, including any extensions of time for filing.
    (d) Penalty imposed on net amount due--(1) Credits against the tax. 
The amount of tax required to be shown on the return for purposes of 
section 6651(a)(1) and the amount shown as tax on the return for 
purposes of section 6651(a)(2) shall be reduced by the amount of any 
part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for 
payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which 
may be claimed on the return.
    (2) Partial payments. (i) The amount of tax required to be shown on 
the return for purposes of section 6651(a)(2) shall, for the purpose of 
computing the addition for any month, be reduced by the amount of any 
part of the tax which is paid after the date prescribed for payment and 
on or before the first day of such month.
    (ii) The amount of tax stated in the notice and demand for purposes 
of section 6651(a)(3) shall, for the purpose of computing the addition 
for any month, be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is 
paid before the first day of such month.
    (e) No addition to tax if fraud penalty assessed. No addition to the 
tax under section 6651 shall be assessed with respect to an underpayment 
of tax if a 50-percent addition to the tax for fraud is assessed with 
respect to the same underpayment under section 6653(b). See section 
6653(d).
    (f) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. (a) Under section 6072(a), income tax returns of 
individuals on a calendar year basis must be filed on or before the 15th 
day of April following the close of the calendar year. Assume an 
individual filed his income tax return for the calendar year 1969 on 
July 20, 1970, and the failure to file on or before the prescribed date 
is not due to reasonable cause. The tax shown on the return is $800 and 
a deficiency of $200 is subsequently assessed, making the tax required 
to be shown on the return, $1,000. Of this amount, $300 has been paid by 
withholding from wages and $400 has been paid as estimated tax. The 
balance due as shown on the return of $100 ($800 shown as tax on the 
return less $700 previously paid) is paid on August 21, 1970. The 
failure to pay on or before the prescribed date is not due to reasonable 
cause. There will be imposed, in addition to interest, an additional 
amount under section 6651(a)(2) of $2.50, which is 2.5 percent (2% for 
the 4 months from April 16 through August 15, and 0.5% for the 
fractional part of the month from August 16 through August 21) of the 
net amount due as shown on the return of $100 ($800 shown on the return 
less $700 paid on or before April 15). There will also be imposed an 
additional amount under section 6651(a)(1) of $58, determined as 
follows:

20 percent (5% per month for the 3 months from April 16 through         
 July 15 and 5% for the fractional part of the month from July          
 16 through July 20) of the net amount due of $300 ($1,000              
 required to be shown on the return less $700 paid on or before         
 April 15).....................................................      $60
Reduced by the amount of the addition imposed under section             
 6651(a)(2) for those months...................................        2
                                                                --------
Addition to tax under section 6651(a)(1).......................      $50
                                                                        

    (b) A notice and demand for the $200 deficiency is issued on January 
8, 1971, but the taxpayer does not pay the deficiency until December 23, 
1971. In addition to interest there will be imposed an additional amount 
under section 6651(a)(3) of $10, determined as follows:

Addition computed without regard to limitation:                         
6 percent (5\1/2\% for the 11 months from January 19, 1971,             
 through December 18, 1971, and 0.5% for the fractional part of         
 the month from December 19 through December 23) of the amount          
 stated in the notice and demand ($200)........................      $12
                                                                --------
Limitation on addition:                                                 
25 percent of the amount stated in the notice and demand ($200)      $50
Reduced by the part of the addition under section 6651(a)(1)            
 for failure to file attributable to the $200 deficiency (20%           
 of $200)......................................................      $40
                                                                --------
Maximum amount of the addition under section 6651(a)(3)........      $10
                                                                ========
                                                                        

    Example 2. An individual files his income tax return for the 
calendar year 1969 on December 2, 1970, and such delinquency is not due 
to reasonable cause. The balance due, as shown on the return, of $500 is 
paid when the return is filed on December 2, 1970. In addition to 
interest and the addition for failure to pay under section 6651(a)(2) of 
$20 (8 months at 0.5% per month, 4%), there will also be imposed an 
additional amount under section 6651(a)(1) of $112.50, determined as 
follows:

Penalty at 5 percent for maximum of 5 months, 25 percent of             
 $500.........................................................   $125.00
Less reduction for the amount of the addition under section             
 6651(a)(2):                                                            
Amount imposed under section 6651(a)(2) for the months in               
 which there is also an addition for failure to file--2\1/2\            
 percent for the 5 months April 16 through September 15 of the          
 net amount due ($500)........................................     12.50
                                                               ---------

Sec. 301.6652-2  Failure by exempt organizations and certain nonexempt organizations to file certain returns or to comply with section 6104(d) for taxable years 
          beginning after December 31, 1969.

    (a) Exempt organization or trust. In the case of a failure to file a 
return required by--
    (1) Section 6033, relating to returns by exempt organizations, 
trusts described in section 4947(a)(1) and nonexempt private 
foundations,
    (2) Section 6034, relating to returns by certain trusts, or
    (3) Section 6043(b), relating to returns regarding the liquidation, 
dissolution, termination, or substantial contraction of an exempt 
organization,

within the time and in the manner prescribed for filing such return 
(determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it 
is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause, there shall be 
paid by the exempt organization or trust failing to file such return $10 
for each day during which such failure continues. However, the total 
amount imposed on any exempt organization or trust under this paragraph 
for such failure with regard to any one return shall not exceed $5,000.
    (b) Managers. If an exempt organization or trust fails to file under 
section 6652(d)(1), the Commissioner may, by written demand, request 
that such organization or trust file the delinquent

[[Page 342]]

return within 90 days after the date of mailing of such demand, or 
within such additional period as the Commissioner shall determine is 
reasonable under the circumstances. If such organization or trust does 
not so file on or before the date specified in such demand, there shall 
be paid by the person or persons responsible for such failure to file 
$10 for each day after such date during which such failure continues, 
unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause. 
However, the total amount imposed under this paragraph on all persons 
responsible for such failure with regard to any one return shall not 
exceed $5,000.
    (c) Public inspection of private foundations' annual returns--(1) In 
general. In the case of a failure to comply with the requirements of 
section 6104(d), relating to public inspection of private foundations' 
annual returns, within the time and in the manner prescribed for 
complying with section 6104(d), unless it is shown that such failure is 
due to reasonable cause, there shall be paid by the person or persons 
responsible for failing to comply with section 6104(d) $10 for each day 
during which such failure continues. However, the total amount imposed 
under this subparagraph on all persons responsible for any such failure 
with regard to any one annual return shall not exceed $5,000.
    (2) Amount imposed. The amount imposed under section 6652(d)(3) is 
$10 per day for a failure to comply with section 6104(d). For example, 
assume that an annual return must be filed by private foundation X on or 
before May 15, 1982, for the calendar year 1981. The foundation without 
reasonable cause does not comply with section 6104(d) by publishing 
notice of the availability of the annual return until July 30, 1982. In 
this case, the person failing to comply with section 6104(d) within the 
prescribed time is required to pay $760 for complying with section 
6104(d) 76 days late.
    (3) Cross reference. For the penalty for willful failure to comply 
with section 6104(d), see Sec. 301.6685-1.
    (d) Special rules. For purposes of section 6652(d) and this 
section--
    (1) Person. The term ``person'' means any officer, director, 
trustee, employee, member, or other individual whose duty it is to 
perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.
    (2) Liability. If more than one person (as defined in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph (d)) is liable for a failure to file or to comply 
with section 6652(d) (2) or (3), all such persons shall be jointly and 
severally liable with respect to such failure.
    (e) Manner of payment. The amount imposed under section 6652(d) and 
this section on any exempt organization, trust, or person (as defined in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section) shall be paid in the same manner as 
tax upon the issuance of a notice and demand therefor.
    (f) Showing of reasonable cause. No amount imposed by section 
6652(d) shall apply with respect to a failure to file or comply under 
this section if it is established to the satisfaction of the district 
director or director of the internal revenue service center that such 
failure was due to reasonable cause. An affirmative showing of 
reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written statement 
containing a declaration by the appropriate person (as defined in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section), or in his absence, by any officer, 
director, or trustee of the organization, that the statement is made 
under the penalties of perjury, setting forth all the facts alleged as 
reasonable cause.
    (g) Group returns. If a central organization is authorized to file a 
group return on behalf of two or more of its local organizations for the 
taxable year in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.6033-2 (Income 
Tax Regulations), the responsibility for timely filing of such a return 
is placed upon the central organization for purposes of this section. 
Consequently, the amount imposed by section 6652(d)(1) for failure to 
file the group return shall be paid by the central organization and the 
amount imposed by section 6652(d)(2) for failure to file the group 
return within the time prescribed by the Commissioner shall be paid by 
the person or persons responsible for filing the group return.
    (h) Effective date. This section shall apply for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1969.

notification of a change in plan status continues. However, the total 
amount imposed by section 6652(e)(2) on the plan administrator with 
respect to a failure to file a notification of a change in plan status 
shall not exceed $1,000.
    (3) Annual return of funded plan of deferred compensation. Under 
section 6652(f) the amount described in this subparagraph is imposed in 
each case in which there is a failure to file the annual return 
described in section 6058(a) on behalf of a plan described in 
Sec. 301.6058-1(a) at the time and in the manner prescribed therefor 
(determined with regard to any extension of time for filing). The 
employer maintaining the plan is liable for the amount imposed with 
respect to a failure to so file the annual return in each case in which 
the employer must file the return under Sec. 301.6058-1(a). The plan 
administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g)) is liable for the 
amount imposed in each case in which the plan administrator must file 
the return under Sec. 301.6058-1(a). In the case of an individual 
retirement account or annuity described in section 408, the individual 
described in Sec. 301.6058-1(d)(2) who must file the annual return under 
Sec. 301.6058-1(d) is liable for the amount imposed with respect to a 
failure to so file the annual return. The amount imposed is $10 for each 
day during which the failure to file the annual return on behalf of a 
plan for a year continues. However, the total amount imposed with 
respect to a failure to file on behalf of a plan for any year shall not 
exceed $5,000.
    (4) Actuarial statement in case of mergers. The plan administrator 
(within the meaning of section 414(g)) is liable for an amount imposed 
by section 6652(f) in each case in which there is a failure to file the 
actuarial statement described in section 6058(b) at the time and in the 
manner prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of 
time for filing). The amount imposed by section 6652(f) on the plan 
administrator is $10 for each day during which the failure to file the 
statement with respect to a merger, consolidation or transfer of assets 
or liabilities continues. However, the amount imposed by section 6652(f) 
on the plan administrator with respect to a failure to file the 
statement with respect to a merger, consolidation or transfer shall not 
exceed $5,000.
    (5) Information relating to certain trusts and annuity and bond 
purchase plans. Under section 6652(f) the amount described in this 
subparagraph is imposed in each case in which there is a failure to file 
a return or statement required by section 6047 at the time and in the 
manner prescribed therefor in Sec. 1.6047-1 (determined with regard to 
any extension of time for filing). The amount is

[[Page 344]]

imposed upon the trustee of a trust described in section 401(a), 
custodian of a custodial account or issuer of an annuity contract, as 
the case may be (see Sec. 1.6047-1(a)(1) (i) and (ii)). The amount 
imposed by section 6652(f) is $10 for each day during which the failure 
to file with respect to a payee for a calendar year continues. However, 
the amount imposed with respect to a failure to file with respect to a 
payee for a calendar year shall not exceed $5,000.
    (b) Showing of reasonable cause. (1) No amount imposed by section 
6652(e) shall apply with respect to a failure to file information 
relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan participant 
under section 6057(a), or a failure to give notice of a change in plan 
status under section 6057(b), if it is established to the satisfaction 
of the director of the internal revenue service center at which the 
information or notice is required to be filed that the failure was due 
to reasonable cause.
    (2) No amount imposed by section 6652(f) shall apply with respect to 
a failure to file a return or statement required by section 6058 or 
6047, or a failure to provide material items of information called for 
on such a return or statement, if it is established to the satisfaction 
of the appropriate district director or the director of the internal 
revenue service center at which the return or statement is required to 
be filed that the failure was due to reasonable cause.
    (3) An affirmative showing of reasonable cause must be made in the 
form of a written statement setting forth all the facts alleged as 
reasonable cause. The statement must contain a declaration by the 
appropriate individual that the statement is made under the penalties of 
perjury.
    (c) Joint liability. If more than one person is responsible for a 
failure to comply with sections 6057 (a) or (b) or section 6058 (a) or 
(b) or section 6047, all such persons shall be jointly and severally 
liable with respect to the failure.
    (d) Manner of payment. An amount imposed under section 6652 (e) or 
(f) and this section shall be paid in the same manner as a tax upon the 
issuance of notice and demand therefor.
    (e) Effective dates--(1) Annual registration statement. With respect 
to the annual registration statement described in section 6057(a), this 
section is effective--
    (i) In the case of a plan to which only one employer contributes, 
for plan years beginning after December 31, 1975, with respect to 
participants who separate from service covered by the plan in plan years 
beginning after that date, and
    (ii) In the case of a plan to which more than one employer 
contributes, for plan years beginning after December 31, 1977, and with 
respect to participants who complete two consecutive 1-year breaks in 
service under the plan in service computation periods beginning after 
December 31, 1974.
    (2) Notification of change in status. With respect to the 
notification of change in plan status required by section 6057(b), this 
section is effective with respect to a change in status occurring within 
plan years beginning after December 31, 1975.
    (3) Annual return of employee benefit plan. With respect to the 
annual return of employee benefit plan required by section 6058(a), this 
section is effective for plan years beginning after September 2, 1974.
    (4) Actuarial statement in case of mergers. With respect to the 
actuarial statement required by section 6058(b), this section is 
effective with respect to mergers, consolidations or transfers of assets 
or liabilities occurring after September 2, 1974.
    (5) Information relating to certain trusts and annuity and bond

Sec. 301.6653-1   Failure to pay tax.

    (a) Negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations 
with respect to income or gift taxes. If any part of any underpayment, 
as defined in section 6653(c)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
of any income tax imposed by

[[Page 345]]

Subtitle A of the Code, or gift tax imposed by Chapter 12, Subtitle B, 
of the Code, is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and 
regulations, but without intent to defraud, there shall be added to the 
tax an amount equal to 5 percent of the underpayment.
    (b) Fraud. (1) If any part of any underpayment of tax, as defined in 
section 6653(c) and paragraph (c) of this section, required to be shown 
on a return is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount 
equal to 50 percent of the underpayment.
    (2) If a 50 percent addition to the tax for fraud is assessed under 
section 6653(b) with respect to an underpayment--
    (i) The addition to the tax under section 6651, relating to failure 
to file a tax return, will not be assessed with respect to the same 
underpayment, and
    (ii) In the case of the income taxes imposed by Subtitle A and the 
gift tax imposed by Chapter 12 of Subtitle B, the 5 percent addition to 
the tax under section 6653(a), relating to negligence and intentional 
disregard of rules and regulations, will not be assessed with respect to 
the same underpayment.
    (c) Definition of underpayment--(1) Income, estate, gift, and 
Chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes. In the case of income, estate, gift, 
and Chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes, an underpayment for purposes of 
section 6653 and this section is--
    (i) The total amount of all deficiencies as defined in section 6211, 
if a return was filed on or before the last date (determined with regard 
to any extension of time) prescribed for filing such return, or
    (ii) The amount of the tax imposed by Subtitle A or B, or Chapter 
41, 42, 43, or 44, as the case may be, if a return was not filed on or 
before the last date (determined with regard to any extension of time) 
prescribed for filing such return.

However, for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, any amount 
of additional tax shown on the amended return, so called, filed after 
the due date of the return is a deficiency.
    (2) Other taxes. In the case of any tax other than an income, 
estate, gift or Chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax, an underpayment for 
purposes of section 6653 and this section is the amount by which the tax 
imposed exceeds--
    (i) In the case of any tax with respect to which the taxpayer is 
required to file a return, the sum of (a) the amount shown as tax by the 
taxpayer upon his return filed in respect of such tax, but only if the 
return is filed on or before the last date (determined with regard to 
any extension of time) prescribed for filing such return, plus (b) any 
amount not shown on a return filed by the taxpayer which is paid in 
respect of such tax prior to the date prescribed for filing the return. 
The ``amount shown as tax by the taxpayer upon his return'' for the 
purposes of this subparagraph shall be determined without regard to any 
credit for an overpayment for any prior tax return period, and without 
regard to any adjustment made under section 6205(a), or section 6413(a), 
relating to special rules applicable to certain employment taxes.
    (ii) In the case of any tax payable by stamp, the amount paid (on or 
before the date prescribed for payment) in respect of such tax.

The amounts specified in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph 
shall be reduced, for purposes of determining the amount of the 
underpayment, by the amount of any rebates made. For purposes of this 
subparagraph, the term ``rebates'' means so much of an abatement, 
credit, refund, or other repayment as was made on the ground that the 
tax imposed was less than the excess of the amount specified in 
subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph, whichever is applicable, 
over any rebates previously made.
    (d) No delinquency penalty if fraud assessed. See paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (e) Failure to pay stamp tax. Any person (as defined in section 
6671(b)) who willfully fails to pay any tax payable by stamp, coupons, 
tickets, books or other devices or methods prescribed by the Code or 
regulations promulgated thereunder, or willfully attempts in any manner 
to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in 
addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty of 
50 percent of the total amount of the underpayment of the tax.

[[Page 346]]

    (f) Joint returns. No person filing a joint return shall be held 
liable for a fraud penalty except for his own personal fraudulent 
conduct. Thus, for the fraud penalty to apply to a taxpayer who files a 
joint return some part of the underpayment in such return must be due to 
the fraud of such taxpayer. A taxpayer shall not be subject to the fraud 
penalty solely by reason of the fraud of a spouse and his filing of a 
joint return with such spouse.

Sec. 301.6656-1  Penalty for underpayment of deposits.

    (a) General rule. If any person is required by the Code or 
regulations prescribed thereunder to deposit any tax in a government 
depositary that is authorized under section 6302(c) to receive the 
deposit, and fails to deposit the tax within the time prescribed 
therefor, a penalty shall be imposed on such person unless the failure 
is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. 
The penalty shall be 5 percent of the amount of the underpayment without 
regard to the period during which the underpayment continues. For 
purposes of this section, the term ``underpayment'' means the amount of 
tax required to be deposited less the amount, if any, that was deposited 
on or before the date prescribed therefor. Section 7502(e) applies in 
determining the date a deposit is made.
    (b) Assertion of reasonable cause. To show that the underpayment was 
due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, a taxpayer must 
make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged as a reasonable cause 
in a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under 
the penalties of perjury. The statement must be filed with the district 
director for the district or the director of the service center where 
the return with respect to the tax is required to be filed. If the 
district director or the director of the service center determines that 
the underpayment was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful 
neglect, the penalty will not be imposed.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6656-2  Penalty for overstated deposit claims.

    (a) General rule. Any person who makes an overstated deposit claim 
on a return is subject to a penalty equal to 25 percent of such claim, 
unless it is shown that the overstated deposit claim is due to 
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. This penalty is in 
addition to any other penalty provided by law, such as the penalty 
provided by section 6656(a), relating to underpayment of deposits.
    (b) Overstated deposit claim. An overstated deposit claim is the 
excess of--
    (1) The amount of any internal revenue tax for any period that a 
person claims, in a return (including an amended return) filed after 
August 13, 1981, to have deposited in a government depositary authorized 
under section 6302(c) to receive the deposit, over
    (2) The aggregate amount for that period that the person has 
deposited, on or before the date such return for that period is filed, 
in a government depositary authorized under section 6302(c) to receive 
the deposit.

An overstated deposit claim includes a claim that deposits have been 
made when no deposits have been made in an authorized government 
depositary. The existence or amount of an overstated deposit claim is 
not limited even though the amount described in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph (b) or the amount described in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph (b) exceeds the actual tax liability. For purposes of this 
paragraph (b), the date a return is considered to be filed is the later 
of the date the return is due to be filed (not

[[Page 347]]

including extensions) or the date the return is actually filed. Section 
7502(e) applies in determining the date a deposit is made. The 
application of this paragraph is illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. On the date a return is due for the taxable period ended 
December 31, 1982, Z files the return claiming deposits of tax in the 
amount of $150 for that period. Z actually made deposits of $75 for that 
period on or before the date the return was due and filed. Z's tax 
liability for that period is $150. Z has made an overstated deposit 
claim in the amount of $75, the excess of the amount of tax claimed on 
the return to have been deposited ($150), over the amount actually 
deposited ($75) for that period on or before the date the return was due 
and filed.
    Example 2. On the date a return is due for the quarter ended 
December 31, 1982, X files the return claiming deposits of tax in the 
amount of $200 for that period. X actually made deposits of $100 for 
that period on or before the date the return was due and filed. X's tax 
liability for that period is $100. X has made an overstated deposit 
claim of $100, the excess of the amount of tax claimed on the return to 
have been deposited ($200), over the amount actually deposited ($100) 
for that period on or before the date the return was due and filed.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2. For that quarter 
ended March 31, 1983, X files a return on the date it is due, claiming 
$100 (the excess of the amount of tax claimed to have been deposited on 
the prior quarter's return, $200, over X's liability for the prior 
quarter, $100) as a deposit for the quarter ended March 31, 1983. X did 
not actually deposit any amount for the quarter ended March 31, 1983, on 
or before the date the return was due and filed. X made an overstated 
deposit claim of $100 for the quarter ended December 31, 1982, as 
described in example 2. For the quarter ended March 31, 1983, X made an 
overstated deposit claim of $100, the excess of the amount of tax 
claimed to have been deposited ($100), over the amount actually 
deposited (0) for that period on or before the date the return was due 
and filed.

    (c) Assertion of reasonable cause. To show that an overstated 
deposit claim was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful 
neglect, a taxpayer must make an affirmative showing of all facts 
alleged as a reasonable cause in a written statement containing a 
declaration that is made under the penalties of perjury. The statement 
must be filed with the district director for the district or the 
director of the service center where the return with respect to the tax 
is required to be filed. If the district director or the director of the 
service center determines that the overstated deposit claim was due to 
reasonable cause and was not due to willful neglect, the penalty will 
not be imposed. The fact that a correct amended return has been filed 
may in some cases be evidence that an overstated deposit claim on the 
original return was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful 
neglect, but is not determinative of that issue.

Sec. 301.6657-1   Bad checks.

    (a) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
if a check or money order is tendered in the payment of any amount 
receivable under the Code, and such check or money order is not paid 
upon presentment, a penalty of one percent of the amount of the check or 
money order, in addition to any other penalties provided by law shall be 
paid by the person who tendered such check or money order. If, however, 
the amount of the check or money order is less than $500, the penalty 
shall be $5 or the amount of the check or money order, whichever amount 
is the lesser. Such penalty shall be paid in the same manner as tax upon 
the issuance of a notice and demand therefor.
    (b) Reasonable cause. If payment is refused upon presentment of any 
check or money order and the person who tendered such check or money 
order establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that it 
was tendered in good faith with reasonable cause to believe that it 
would be duly paid, the penalty set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply.

Sec. 301.6658-1   Addition to tax in case of jeopardy.

    Upon a finding by the district director that any taxpayer violated, 
or attempted to violate, section 6851 (relating to termination of 
taxable year) there shall, in addition to all other penalties, be added 
as part of the tax 25 percent of the total amount of the tax or 
deficiency in the tax.

[[Page 348]]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6659-1   Applicable rules.

    (a) Additions treated as tax. Except as otherwise provided in the 
Code, any reference in the Code to ``tax'' shall be deemed also to be a 
reference to any addition to the tax, additional amount, or penalty 
imposed by chapter 68 of the Code with respect to such tax. Such 
additions to the tax, additional amounts, and penalties shall become 
payable upon notice and demand therefor and shall be assessed, 
collected, and paid in the same manner as taxes.
    (b) Additions to tax for failure to file return or pay tax. Any 
addition under section 6651 or section 6653 to a tax shall be considered 
a part of such tax for the purpose of the assessment and collection of 
such tax. For applicability of deficiency procedures to additions to the 
tax, see paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Deficiency procedures--(1) Addition to the tax for failure to 
file tax return. (i) Subchapter B, chapter 63, of the Code (deficiency 
procedures) applies to the additions to the income estate, gift, and 
chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes imposed by section 6651 for failure to 
file a tax return to the same extent that it applies to such taxes. 
Accordingly, if there is a deficiency (as defined in section 6211) in 
the tax (apart from the addition to the tax) where a return has not been 
timely filed, deficiency procedures apply to the addition to the tax 
under section 6651. If there is no deficiency in the tax where a return 
has not been timely filed, the addition to the tax under section 6651 
may be assessed and collected without deficiency procedures.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A filed his income tax return for the calendar year 1955 
on May 15, 1956, not having been granted an extension of time for such 
filing. His failure to file on time was not due to reasonable cause. The 
return showed a liability of $1,000 and it was determined that A is 
liable under section 6651 for an addition to such tax of $50 (5 percent 
a month for 1 month). The provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 
(deficiency procedures) do not apply to the assessment and collection of 
the addition to the tax since such provisions are not applicable to the 
tax with respect to which such addition was asserted, there being no 
statutory deficiency for purposes of section 6211.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 and assume further 
that a deficiency of $500 in tax and a further $25 addition to the tax 
under section 6651 is asserted against A for the calendar year 1955. 
Thus, the total addition to the tax under section 6651 is $75. Since the 
provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 are applicable to the $500 
deficiency, they likewise apply to the $25 addition to the tax asserted 
with respect to such deficiency (but not to the $50 addition to the tax 
under example 1).

    (2) Additions to the tax for negligence or fraud. Subchapter B of 
chapter 63 (deficiency procedures) applies to all additions to the 
income, estate, gift, and chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes imposed by 
section 6653 (a) and (b) for negligence and fraud.
    (3) Additions to tax for failure to pay estimated income taxes--(i) 
Return filed by taxpayer. The addition to the tax for underpayment of 
estimated income tax imposed by section 6654 (relating to failure by 
individuals to pay estimated income tax) or section 6655 (relating to 
failure by corporations to pay estimated income tax) is determined by 
reference to the tax shown on the return if a return is filed. 
Therefore, such addition may be assessed and collected without regard to 
the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 (deficiency procedures) if 
a return is filed since such provisions are not applicable to the 
assessment of the tax shown on the return. Further, since the additions 
to the tax imposed by section 6654 or 6655 are determined solely by 
reference to the amount of tax shown on the return if a return is filed, 
the assertion of a deficiency with respect to any tax not shown on such 
return will not make the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 
(deficiency procedures) apply to the assessment and collection of any 
additions to the tax under section 6654 or 6655.
    (ii) No return filed by taxpayer. If the taxpayer has not filed a 
return and his entire income tax liability is asserted as a deficiency 
to which the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 apply, such 
provisions likewise will apply to any addition to such tax imposed by 
section 6654 or 6655.

                          Assessable Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 301.6671-1   Rules for application of assessable penalties.

    (a) Penalty assessed as tax. The penalties and liabilities provided 
by subchapter B, chapter 68, of the Code (sections 6671 to 6675, 
inclusive) shall be paid upon notice and demand by the district director 
or the director of the regional service center and shall be assessed and 
collected in the same manner as taxes. Except as otherwise provided, any 
reference in the Code to ``tax'' imposed thereunder shall also be deemed 
to refer to the penalties and liabilities provided by subchapter B of 
chapter 68.
    (b) Person defined. For purposes of subchapter B of chapter 68, the 
term ``person'' includes an officer or employee of a corporation, or a 
member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or 
member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the 
violation occurs.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6672-1   Failure to collect and pay over tax, or attempt to evade or defeat tax.

    Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over 
any tax imposed by the Code who willfully fails to collect such tax, or 
truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in 
any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, 
shall, in addition to other penalties, be liable to a penalty equal to 
the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted 
for and paid over. The penalty imposed by section 6672 applies only to 
the collection, accounting for, or payment over of taxes imposed on a 
person other than the person who is required to collect, account for, 
and pay over such taxes. No penalty under section 6653, relating to 
failure to pay tax, shall be imposed for any offense to which this 
section is applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6673-1   Damages assessable for instituting proceedings before the Tax Court merely for delay.

    Any damages awarded to the United States by the Tax Court under 
section 6673 against a taxpayer for instituting proceedings before the 
Tax Court merely for delay shall be assessed at the same time at the 
deficiency and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district 
director or the director of the regional service center and shall be

    (b) Manner of payment. The penalty imposed under section 6678 and 
this section on any person shall be paid in the same manner as tax upon

such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. An 
affirmative showing of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a 
written statement, containing a declaration that it is made under the 
penalties of perjury, setting forth all the facts alleged as a 
reasonable cause.

Sec. 301.6679-1   Failure to file returns, etc. with respect to foreign corporations or foreign partnerships for taxable years beginning after September 3, 
          1982.

    (a) Civil penalty--(1) In general. In addition to any criminal 
penalty provided by law, each U.S. citizen, resident, or person filing a 
separate or joint information return or on whose behalf a return is 
filed, pursuant to sections 6035, 6046, or 6046A, and the regulations 
thereunder, who fails to file such a return within the time provided, or 
who files a return which does not show the required information, shall 
pay a penalty of $1,000, unless such failure is shown to be due to 
reasonable cause.
    (2) Joint return. The penalty imposed by section 6679 and this 
section shall apply to each U.S. citizen, resident, or person filing a 
joint return pursuant to the provisions of section 6035, 6046, or 6046A, 
which does not show the required information.
    (3) Showing of reasonable cause. The district director, the director 
of the Internal Revenue service center, and the director of 
International Operations are authorized to make the determination that 
such failure was due to a reasonable cause and that, accordingly, the 
penalty imposed by section 6679 shall not apply. An affirmative showing 
of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written statement, 
containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, 
setting forth all the facts alleged as a reasonable cause. If the 
taxpayer exercises ordinary business care and prudence and is 
nevertheless unable to furnish any item of information required under 
section 6035, 6046, or 6046A and the regulations thereunder, such 
failure shall be considered due to a reasonable cause. In determining 
the extent of a taxpayer's ability to obtain information, the percentage 
of stock owned by such taxpayer and the nature of the other interests in 
the foreign corporation will be considered.
    (b) Deficiency procedures not to apply. The penalty imposed by 
section 6679 may be assessed and collected without regard to the 
deficiency procedures provided by subchapter B of chapter 63 of the 
Code.

any act or failure to act which is not due to reasonable cause and 
either--
    (1) Such person has theretofore (at any time) been liable for tax 
under any section of such chapter (other than section 4940 or 4948(a)),

violation was due to reasonable cause. An affirmative showing of 
reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written statement, 
containing a declaration by such person that it is made under the 
penalties of perjury, setting forth all the facts alleged as reasonable 
cause.

Sec. 301.6688-1   Assessable penalties with respect to information required to be furnished under section 7654 on allocation of tax to Guam or the United 
          States.

    (a) In general. Each individual to whom paragraph (a)(2) of 
Sec. 301.7654-1 applies for a taxable year who fails to file for such 
year the information return required by paragraph (d) of such section 
within the time prescribed therein, or who files such a return but does 
not show the information required thereon, shall, in addition to any 
criminal penalty provided by law, pay a penalty of $100 for each such 
failure.
    (b) Manner of payment. The penalty set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be paid in the same manner

[[Page 352]]

as tax upon the issuance of a notice and demand therefor.
    (c) Reasonable cause. The penalty set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply if it is established, to the satisfaction of the 
district director (or of the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation of 
Guam if the individual was required to file his return of income tax for 
the taxable year with Guam) that the failure to file the information 
return or furnish the information within the prescribed time was due to 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. An individual who wishes to 
avoid the penalty must make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged 
as a reasonable cause for his failure to file the information return on 
time, or furnish the information on time, in the form of a written 
statement containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of 
perjury. Such statement must be filed with the district director (or 
with the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation, Agana, Guam 96910, if the 
individual was required to file his return of income tax for the taxable 
year with Guam). In determining whether there was reasonable cause for 
failure to furnish the required information, account will be taken of 
the fact that the individual was unable to furnish the required 
information in spite of the exercise of ordinary business care and 
prudence in his effort to furnish the information. An individual will be 
considered to have exercised ordinary business care and prudence in his 
effort to furnish the required information if he made reasonable efforts 
to furnish the information but was unable to do so because of a lack of 
sufficient facts on which to make a proper determination. See paragraph 
(b) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) for the 
rules which specify where returns of income tax must be filed for the 
taxable year by individuals to whom this section applies.
    (d) Effective date. This section shall apply for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1972.

Sec. 301.6689-1T  Failure to file notice of redetermination of foreign tax (temporary).

    (a) Application of civil penalty. If a foreign tax redetermination 
was made with respect to taxes for which the taxpayer previously claimed 
the foreign tax credit, and the taxpayer failed to notify the Service on 
or before the date prescribed in regulations under section 905(c) or in 
regulations under section 404A(g)(2) for giving notice of a foreign tax 
redetermination, then, unless paragraph (d) of this section applies, 
there shall be added to the deficiency attributable to such 
redetermination an amount determined under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Amount of penalty. The amount of the penalty shall be equal to--
    (1) Five percent of the deficiency if the failure is for not more 
than one month, plus
    (2) An additional five percent of the deficiency for each month (or 
fraction thereof) during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 
in the aggregate twenty-five percent of the deficiency. If the penalty 
imposed under paragraph (a) of this section applies, then the penalty 
imposed under section 6653(a), relating to failure to pay by reason of 
negligent or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, shall not 
apply.
    (c) Foreign tax redetermination defined. For purposes of this 
section, a foreign tax redetermination is any redetermination for which 
a notice is required under section 905(c) and the regulations 
thereunder, or section 404A(g)(2) and the regulations thereunder.
    (d) Reasonable cause. The penalty set forth in this section shall 
not apply if it is established to the satisfaction of the Service that 
the failure to file the notification within the prescribed time was due 
to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. An affirmative 
showing of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written 
statement that sets forth all the facts alleged as reasonable cause for 
the failure to file the notification on time and that contains a 
declaration by the taxpayer that the statement is made under the 
penalties of perjury. This statement must be filed with the service 
center in which the notification

[[Page 353]]

was required to be filed. The taxpayer must file this statement with the 
notice required under section 905(c) and the regulations thereunder or 
section 404A(g)(2) and the regulations thereunder. If the taxpayer 
exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless 
unable to file the notification within the prescribed time, then the 
delay will be considered to be due to reasonable cause and not willful 
neglect.
    (e) Effective date. This section is effective with respect to 
foreign tax redeterminations occurring after December 31, 1979.

Sec. 301.6692-1  Failure to file actuarial report.

    (a) Penalty. In each case in which the plan administrator (within 
the meaning of section 414(g)) of a defined benefit plan to which the 
minimum funding standards of section 412 apply fails to file the 
actuarial report described in section 6059 and Sec. 301.6059-1 within 
the time prescribed, the plan administrator shall pay a penalty of 
$1,000. A failure to provide a material item of information called for 
in the actuarial report is considered a failure to file the report. For 
this purpose, the signature of an enrolled actuary (see Sec. 301.6059-
1(d)) is considered a material item of information.
    Further, for any report filed for a plan year ending after January 
25, 1982, if the actuary seeks to materially qualify a statement 
required by Sec. 301.6059-1(c) (4) or (5) there is a failure to provide 
a material item of information called for in the report. For rules 
relating to statements not considered as materially qualifying the 
required statements, see Sec. 301.6059-1(d).
    (b) Failure to make actuarial valuation. Section 412(c)(9) and the 
regulations thereunder prescribe the time for making an actuarial 
valuation of a defined benefit plan. For purposes of this section, the 
failure to base information called for in the actuarial report upon an 
actuarial valuation of the plan which is made within the time prescribed 
by section 412(c)(9) and the regulations thereunder is considered a 
failure to file the actuarial report.
    (c) Showing of reasonable cause. The penalty imposed by this section 
does not apply if it is established to the satisfaction of the 
appropriate district director or the director of the Internal Revenue 
Service Center at which the actuarial report is required to be filed 
that the failure to file the report was due to reasonable cause. An 
affirmative showing of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a 
written statement setting forth all the facts alleged as reasonable 
cause. The statement must contain a declaration by the appropriate 
individual that the statement is made under the penalties of perjury.
    (d) Joint liability. If more than one person is responsible as a 
plan administrator for a failure to file the actuarial report, all such 
persons are jointly and severally liable with respect to the failure.
    (e) Manner of payment. The penalty imposed for the failure to file 
an actuarial report shall be paid in the same manner as a tax upon the 
issuance of notice and demand therefor.
    (f) Effective dates. In the case of a plan in existence on January 
1, 1974, this section is effective beginning with the first plan year 
beginning after December 31, 1975, for which the minimum funding 
standards of section 412 apply to the plan. In the case of a plan not in

the first plan year beginning after September 2, 1974, for which the 
minimum funding standards apply to the plan.

Sec. 301.6707-1T  Questions and answers relating to penalties for failure to furnish information regarding tax shelters.

    The following questions and answers relate to the penalties imposed 
by section 6707 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added by 
section 141(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 
681), for failure to furnish information regarding tax shelters.

Penalties for Failure To Register and for Providing False or Incomplete 
                               Information

    Q-1. What are the consequences if a person required to register a 
tax shelter (``tax shelter organizer'') fails to register the shelter 
timely?
    A-1. Generally, a penalty will be imposed. The penalty for failure 
to register timely is the greater of (i) $500 or (ii) 1 percent of the 
aggregate amount invested in the tax shelter, not to exceed $10,000. The 
$10,000 limitation does not apply, however, if the tax shelter organizer 
intentionally disregards the registration requirements. For purposes of 
this penalty, the aggregate amount invested in the tax shelter is 
computed in the manner prescribed in A-21 of Sec. 301.6111-1T, except 
that the amount to be received from the sale of an interest is taken 
into account to determine the amount of the penalty only if the interest 
is sold to an investor. No penalty will be imposed on a person for 
failure to register a tax shelter if the failure is due to reasonable 
cause. See A-4 through A-6 of this section for rules relating to 
reasonable cause.

[[Page 355]]

    Q-2. Will registration of a tax shelter by a person participating in 
the management (``manager'') or a person participating in the sale 
(``seller'') of a tax shelter after the date that interests in the tax 
shelter were first offered for sale relieve a person principally 
responsible for organizing the tax shelter (``principal organizer'') or 
a person who participated in the organization of the tax shelter of 
liability for failure to register?
    A-2. No. A principal organizer of a tax shelter and a person who 
participates in the organization of a tax shelter are subject to penalty 
if they fail to register a tax shelter by the day interests in the tax 
shelter are first offered for sale, regardless of whether a seller or 
manager subsequently registers the tax shelter.
    Q-3. Does registration of a tax shelter by a seller or manager 
relieve other sellers or managers who are required to register the tax 
shelter from liability for failure to register?
    A-3. No. Sellers and managers who are required to register a tax 
shelter and fail to do so are subject to the penalty unless their 
failure to register is due to reasonable cause. A seller or manager, 
however, is not required to register a tax shelter once the seller or 
manager knows the tax shelter has been registered. See A-6 of this 
section for rules relating to reasonable cause for failure to register 
in the case of a seller.
    Q-4. What constitutes reasonable cause for failure to register a tax 
shelter?
    A-4. In general, the determination of whether reasonable cause 
exists for failure to register a tax shelter is a question of fact. In 
determining whether reasonable cause exists, all representations known 
to the tax shelter organizer (or for which there is reason for the tax 
shelter organizer to have known) must be taken into account. A tax 
shelter organizer (other than a seller) ordinarily will be deemed to 
know of all representations (including those made by sellers) that the 
tax shelter organizer would have discovered through inquiry that a 
reasonable person acting in the tax shelter organizer's capacity could 
have undertaken. Thus, for example, a principal organizer generally will 
be obligated to make a more thorough inquiry than a person who merely 
participated in the management of a tax shelter.
    Q-5. Will a tax shelter organizer who is required to register a tax 
shelter before October 1, 1984, have reasonable cause for failure timely 
to register the tax shelter, if the tax shelter organizer registers the 
tax shelter after the day on which the first offering for sale of 
interests occurs, but before October 1, 1984?
    A-5. Yes. A person who is required to register a tax shelter before 
October 1, 1984 (i.e., a tax shelter in which the first offering for 
sale of an interest occurred before September 1, 1984, but in which 
interests will be sold after August 31, 1984, or a tax shelter in which 
the first offering for sale of an interest occurs after August 31, 1984, 
and before October 1, 1984), will have reasonable cause for the failure 
to register timely if the person registers the tax shelter on or before 
September 30, 1984.
    Q-6. What constitutes reasonable cause for failure to register a tax 
shelter in the case of a seller of interests in the tax shelter?
    A-6. Reasonable cause for failure to register a tax shelter will 
generally exist with respect to a seller who is required to register the 
tax shelter under A-36 or A-39 of Sec. 301.6111-1T, if the seller 
registers the tax shelter as soon as practicable after the seller first 
knows or has reason to know that the tax shelter has not been timely 
registered. A seller will not have reasonable cause, however, if the 
seller fails to make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether the tax 
shelter is registered.
    Q-7. If a group of tax shelter organizers enters into a designation 
agreement under A-38 of Sec. 301.6111-1T and the designated organizer 
fails to register the tax shelter timely, will the other persons who 
have signed the designation agreement have reasonable cause for failure 
to register the tax shelter?
    A-7. Each of the persons who signs a designation agreement, other 
than the designated organizer, will have reasonable cause for failure to 
register the tax shelter timely, provided the person does not 
participate in the tax shelter at a time when the person knows or has 
reason to know the tax shelter is not

[[Page 356]]

registered (without registering the tax shelter) and the person 
registers the tax shelter as required by A-39 of Sec. 301.6111-1T.
    Q-8. What are the consequences if a tax shelter organizer files 
false or incomplete information on Form 8264?
    A-8. Generally, a penalty will be imposed for filing information 
that a reasonable person would know or have reason to know is false or 
incomplete. The amount of the penalty is the greater of (i) $500 or (ii) 
1 percent of the aggregate amount invested in the tax shelter (computed 
in the manner prescribed in A-1 of this section), but not to exceed 
$10,000. The $10,000 limitation does not apply, however, if the tax 
shelter organizer intentionally disregards the requirements relating to 
registration.
    Q-9. What is the maximum penalty that may be imposed on any one tax 
shelter?
    A-9. Although the penalty for failure to register a tax shelter 
timely and the penalty for providing false or incomplete information may 
be imposed on each person who fails to register a tax shelter timely or 
who provides false or incomplete information, the maximum penalty is 
$10,000 for any one tax shelter, provided there is no intentional 
disregard of the registration requirements. For example, assume that A 
is the principal organizer of a tax shelter, and seven other persons 
participate in the organization of the tax shelter, and assume the tax 
shelter is not registered before the day on which the first offering for 
sale of an interest in the tax shelter occurs. Assume also that the A 
and other participants do not have reasonable cause for failure to 
register timely and the failure is not due to intentional disregard of 
the registration requirement on the part of any of the participants. The 
maximum penalty that may be imposed is $10,000, for which the 8 
participants are jointly and severally liable.
    Q-10. How will the Internal Revenue Service determine whether a 
person has intentionally disregarded any of the registration 
requirements?
    A-10. The determination of intentional disregard will be made 
individually for each tax shelter organizer. If one tax shelter 
organizer intentionally disregards the registration requirements, the 
$10,000 limitation will not apply to that organizer. The limitation will 
apply, however, to any tax shelter organizers whose failure to register 
timely or whose furnishing of false or incomplete information was not 
due to intentional disregard.
    Q-11. What is the maximum penalty that may be imposed if a tax 
shelter that is a substantial investment consisting of similar 
investments that are required to be aggregated under A-22 of 
Sec. 301.6171-1T is not timely registered or if false or incomplete 
information is filed with respect to the tax shelter?
    A-11. The maximum penalty is $10,000 as determined under A-6 of this 
section, with respect to any investment that is a tax shelter within the 
meaning of A-4 of Sec. 301.6111-1T without regard to the aggregation 
rules provided in A-22 of Sec. 301.6111-1T. The maximum penalty that may 
be imposed with respect to investments that are considered in a single 
tax shelter only by reason of the aggregation rules of A-22 of 
Sec. 301.6111-1T is $10,000, even if more than one Form 8264 is required 
with respect to the aggregated investment (see A-48 of Sec. 301.6111-
1T). The penalty may be imposed, however, if there is a failure with 
respect to any of the required forms.

          Penalty for Failure To Furnish a Registration Number

    Q-12. What is the penalty for failure to furnish the registration 
number to a purchaser or other transferee of an interest in a tax 
shelter as required by A-52 through A-54 of Sec. 301.6111-1T?
    A-12. The penalty for failure to furnish the tax shelter 
registration number in the form required by A-55 through A-54 of 
Sec. 301.6111-1T is $100 for each failure.

     Penalty for Failure To Report a Registration Number on a Return

    Q-13. What is the penalty for failure to include the tax shelter 
registration number on a return on which any deduction, loss, credit, 
other tax benefit, or any income attributable to a registered tax 
shelter is included?
    A-13. The penalty for each failure by an investor to furnish the tax 
shelter registration number on such a return is

[[Page 357]]

$50 for each tax shelter, unless the failure is due to reasonable cause.
    There is a need for immediate guidance with respect to provisions 
contained in this Treasury decision. For this reason, it is found 
impracticable to issue it with notice and public procedure under 
subsection (b) of section 553 of Title 5 of United States Code or 
subject to the effective date limitation of subsection (d) of that 
section.

Sec. 301.6708-1T  Failure to maintain list of investors in potentially abusive tax shelters (temporary).

    The following questions and answers issued under section 6708 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added by section 142 of the Tax Reform 
Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369; 98 Stat. 683), relate to the penalty for 
failure to maintain a list of investors in potentially abusive tax 
shelters.
    Q-1: What penalties are provided with respect to the failure 
properly to maintain a list of persons who acquire interests in 
potentially abusive tax shelters?
    A-1: Any organizer (as defined in A-5 of Sec. 301.6112-1T) of a tax 
shelter (as defined in A-3 of Sec. 301.6112-1T) or seller (as defined in 
A-6 of Sec. 301.6112-1T) of interests in a tax shelter who fails to meet 
any requirement imposed by section 6112 regarding the requirement to 
maintain a list of persons who have acquired interests in a tax shelter 
shall pay a penalty of $50 for each investor with respect to whom there 
is such a failure, unless it is shown that the failure is due to 
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. For example, if an 
organizer who is required to maintain a list identifying each of 100 
persons who acquired interests in a tax shelter fails to maintain the 
list, the organizer will be liable for a penalty of $5,000 ($50  x  100 
persons), unless the organizer can show the failure was due to 
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. As another example, if 
a seller is required to maintain a list identifying each of 100 persons 
who acquired interests in a tax shelter from the seller and fails 
properly to maintain such list by omitting the TIN of each person, the 
seller will be liable for a penalty of $5,000 ($50  x  100 persons), 
unless the seller can show the failure was due to reasonable cause and 
not due to willful neglect.
    Q-2: If an organizer or seller properly maintains a list, but fails 
to make the list available to the Internal Revenue Service upon request, 
will the organizer or seller be subject to a penalty?
    A-2: Yes. A penalty applies if an organizer or seller fails to meet 
any requirement imposed by section 6112, including the requirement, upon 
request, to make the list available to the Internal Revenue Service as 
soon as practicable, but in any event within 10 calendar days. (See A-21 
of Sec. 301.6112-1T). The amount of the penalty is $50 for each person 
required to be on the list at the time of the request by the Internal 
Revenue Service. Assume, for example, that an organizer of a tax shelter 
properly maintains a list of 200 persons who have acquired interests in 
a tax shelter and that the Internal Revenue Service requests the 
organizer to provide the list. If the organizer fails to provide the 
list to the Internal Revenue Service as soon as practicable (as required 
by A-21 of Sec. 301.6112-1T), or in a form that enables the Internal 
Revenue Service to obtain the required information without undue delay 
or difficulty (as required by A-16 of Sec. 301.6112-1T), the organizer 
will be liable for a penalty of $10,000 ($50  x  200 persons), unless 
the organizer can show that the failure to provide the list was due to 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
    Q-3: If an organizer or seller is required to maintain lists for 
more than one tax shelter in which the same person has acquired 
interests, how does the penalty apply if the organizer or seller fails 
to identify the person on each of the lists?
    A-3: A separate $50 penalty applies with respect to the list for 
each tax shelter on which the person who acquired interests is not 
identified.
    Q-4: Is there a limitation on the amount of the penalty imposed on a 
seller or organizer required to maintain a list of persons who have 
acquired interests in a tax shelter?

[[Page 358]]

    A-4: Yes. The maximum penalty that may be imposed on a person for 
any calendar year may not exceed $50,000.
    Q-5: How does the calendar year limitation apply?
    A-5: A separate $50,000 limitation applies to each calendar year in 
which a failure occurs, and to each tax shelter for which a list is 
required to be maintained. See A-6 of this section for special rules for 
determining how the $50,000 limitation applies to a designated person 
who fails properly to maintain a list of investors.

    Example 1. Assume that A, an organizer of a tax shelter, fails to 
maintain and to provide to the Internal Revenue Service a list of 900 
persons who acquired interests in the tax shelter in 1986. In addition, 
assume that A again fails to maintain and to provide the list of 900 
investors upon request in 1987. A is subject to a penalty of $45,000 
(900 persons  x  $50) for each calendar year in which there is a failure 
to comply with the requirements of section 6112. Thus, A is subject to 
$45,000 in penalties for the failures to maintain and to provide the 
list in 1986, and $45,000 in penalties for the failures to maintain and 
to provide the list in 1987, unless A can show reasonable cause for the 
failures.
    Example 2. Assume that B, an organizer of Tax Shelter I, fails to 
provide a list of 1,500 persons who acquired interests in the tax 
shelter to the Internal Revenue Service upon request in 1987. Assume 
also that B, an organizer of Tax Shelter II, fails to provide a list of 
2,000 persons who acquired interests in Tax Shelter II to the Internal 
Revenue Service upon request in 1987. Because the $50,000 calendar year 
limitation applies separately with respect to each tax shelter for which 
a list must be maintained, B is subject to a penalty of $50,000 for 
failing to provide the list for Tax Shelter I in 1987 and a $50,000 
penalty for failing to provide the list for Tax Shelter II in 1987.

    Q-6: How does the penalty apply to a designated person?
    A-6: Separate penalties, each with its own $50,000 calendar year 
limitation, apply with respect to the portion of the list kept by the 
designated person in that person's capacity as organizer and to each 
portion of the list kept by the designated person in that person's 
capacity as the designated person with respect to each organizer and 
seller who signed the agreement under A-12 of Sec. 301.6112-1T and for 
whom the designated person is responsible for complying with the 
requirements of section 6112.

    Example. Assume that X, an organizer and seller, sells interests in 
a tax shelter directly to 750 investors in 1985. In addition, assume 
that A, an agent of X, negotiates for X sales of interests in the tax 
shelter to an additional 500 persons in 1985. If no agreement to 
designate X is made pursuant to A-11 of Sec. 301.6112-1T, X would be 
required to maintain a list of the 1,250 investors who acquired 
interests in the tax shelter (see paragraph (a) of A-8 of Sec. 301.6112-
1T) and A would be required to maintain a list of the 500 persons who 
acquired interests through A (see A-10 of Sec. 301.6112-1T). If, 
therefore, neither X nor A complied with the requirements of section 
6112 in 1985, X would be liable for $50,000 in penalties ($50  x  1,250 
investors, subject to the $50,000 maximum) and A would be liable for 
$25,000 in penalties $50  x  500 investors). Assume, however, that X and 
A enter into a written agreement to designate X to maintain the list for 
the tax shelter. Pursuant to that agreement, A submits to X all of the 
required information regarding the sales to the 500 persons otherwise 
required to be maintained on A's list and provides the notice required 
by A-13 of Sec. 301.6112-1T to each person. In 1986, X fails to provide 
any list of investors to the Internal Revenue Service upon request. For 
calendar year 1986, X is liable for penalties of $50,000 in X's capacity 
as an organizer ($50  x  1,250 persons, subject to the $50,000 maximum). 
In addition, X, as the person designated to maintain the list for A, is 
liable for penalties of $25,000 for failing properly to maintain A's 
list of investors ($50  x  500 persons). A would not be liable for any 
penalties.

    Q-7: If an organizer or seller is subject to a penalty with respect 
to a tax shelter under section 6708, may the organizer or seller also be 
liable for other fines or penalties with respect to the tax shelter?
    A-7: Yes. The penalty imposed by section 6708 is in addition to any 
other penalty provided by law. If, for example, an organizer of a tax 
shelter is subject to a penalty under section 6700 for promoting an 
abusive tax shelter, the organizer also would be liable for any 
applicable penalties for failing properly to maintain a list for the tax 
shelter. Similarly, if an organizer or seller fails to furnish a list 
upon request by the Internal Revenue Service, the organizer or seller 
may be subject both to the fine under section 7203 for the willful 
failure to supply information, and to the penalty for failing properly 
to maintain a list for the tax shelter.
    Q-8: When is the penalty under section 6708 effective?

[[Page 359]]

    A-8: The penalty under section 6708 applies with respect to any 
interest in a tax shelter which is required to be included on a list 
under section 6112. See A-22 of Sec. 301.6112-1T.

(Secs. 6112 and 7805, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (98 Stat. 681; 68A 
Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 6112 and 7805))

Sec. 301.6712-1  Failure to disclose treaty-based return positions.

    (a) Penalty imposed. A taxpayer who fails in a material way to 
disclose one or more positions taken for a taxable year, as required by 
section 6114 and the regulations thereunder, is subject to a separate 
penalty for each failure to disclose a position taken with respect to 
each separate payment or separate income item in the amount of--
    (1) For a corporation taxable as such under the Code $10,000; or
    (2) For all other taxpayers, $1,000.

The penalty imposed by this section may be imposed more than once for a 
single taxable year if a taxpayer has failed to disclose one or more 
positions taken with respect to more than one separate payment or 
separate income item and may be imposed in addition to any other penalty 
imposed by law. For this purpose, separate payments or income items of 
the same type (e.g., interest payments) received from the same ultimate 
payor (e.g., the obligor on the note) will be treated as separate 
payments or income items (and not aggregated). However, for purposes of 
determining the number of separate penalties to be imposed under this 
section, the District Director shall have the discretion to aggregate 
separate payments or income items, in whole or in part, in accordance 
with the rules for aggregation of such items for purposes of reporting, 
as described in Sec. 301.6114-1(d).
    (b) Penalty waived. Pursuant to the authority contained in section 
6712(b) of the Code, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this 
section may be waived, in whole or in part, if it is established to the 
satisfaction of the Assistant Commissioner (International), the District 
Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center that the 
taxpayer's failure to disclose the required information was not due to 
willful neglect. An affirmative showing of lack of willful neglect must 
be made in the form of a written statement that sets forth all the facts 
alleged to show lack of willful neglect and contains a declaration by 
such person that the statement is made under the penalties of perjury.
    (c) Manner of payment. The penalty set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be paid in the same manner as tax upon the issuance 
of a notice and demand thereof.
    (d) Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years of 
the taxpayer for which the due date for filing returns (without 
extension) occurs after December 31, 1988.

Sec. 301.6721-1  Failure to file correct information returns.

    (a) Imposition of penalty--(1) General rule. A penalty of $50 is 
imposed for each information return (as defined in section 6724(d)(1) 
and paragraph (g) of this section) with respect to which a failure (as 
defined in section 6721(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section) 
occurs. No more than one penalty will be imposed under this paragraph 
(a)(1)

[[Page 361]]

with respect to a single information return even though there may be 
more than one failure with respect to such return. The total amount 
imposed on any person for all failures during any calendar year with 
respect to all information returns shall not exceed $250,000. See 
paragraph (b) of this section for a reduction in the penalty when the 
failures are corrected within specified periods. See paragraph (c) of 
this section for an exception to the penalty for inconsequential errors 
or omissions. See paragraph (d) of this section for an exception to the 
penalty for a de minimis number of failures. See paragraph (e) of this 
section for lower limitations to the $250,000 maximum penalty. See 
paragraph (f) of this section for higher penalties when a failure is due 
to intentional disregard of the requirement to file timely correct 
information returns. See paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 301.6724-1 for waiver 
of the penalty for a failure that is due to reasonable cause.
    (2) Failures subject to the penalty. The failures to which section 
6721(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply are--
    (i) A failure to file an information return on or before the 
required filing date (``failure to file timely''), and
    (ii) A failure to include all of the information required to be 
shown on the return or the inclusion of incorrect information (``failure 
to include correct information''). A failure to file timely includes a 
failure to file in the required manner, for example, on magnetic media 
or in other machine-readable form as provided under section 6011(e). 
However, no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
solely by reason of any failure to comply with the requirements of 
section 6011(e)(2)(A), except to the extent that such a failure occurs 
with respect to more than 250 information returns (the 250-threshold 
requirement). The 250-threshold requirements applies separately to each 
type of information return required to be filed. Further, the 250-
threshold requirement applies separately to original and corrected 
returns. Thus, for example, if a filer files 300 returns on Form 1099-
DIV and later files 70 corrected returns on Form 1099-DIV, the corrected 
returns may be filed either on the prescribed paper form (because they 
fall below the 250-threshold requirement) or on magnetic media or other 
machine-readable form. Filers who are required to file information 
returns on magnetic media and who file such information returns 
electronically are considered to have satisfied the magnetic media 
filing requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, a failure to include correct information encompasses a failure 
to include the information required by applicable information reporting 
statutes or by any administrative pronouncements issued thereunder (such 
as regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, or information 
reporting forms and form instructions). A failure to include information 
in the correct format may be either a failure to file timely an 
information return or a failure to include correct information on an 
information return. For example, an error on a magnetic media submission 
to the Internal Revenue Service that prevents processing by the Internal 
Revenue Service may constitute a failure to file timely. However, if 
information is set forth on the wrong field of the magnetic media 
submission, such an error may constitute a failure to file timely or a 
failure to include correct information, depending upon the extent of the 
failure.
    (b) Reduction in the penalty when a correction is made within 
specified periods--(1) Correction within 30 days. The penalty imposed 
under section 6721(a) for a failure to file timely or for a failure to 
include correct information shall be $15 in lieu of $50 if the failure 
is corrected on or before the 30th day after the required filing date 
(``within 30 days''). The total amount imposed on a person for all 
failures during any calendar year that are corrected within 30 days 
shall not exceed $75,000.
    (2) Correction after 30 days but on or before August 1. The penalty 
imposed under section 6721(a) for a failure to file timely or for a 
failure to include correct information shall be $30 in lieu of $50 if 
the failure is corrected after the 30-day period described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section but on or before August 1 of the year in which 
the required filing date occurs (``after 30 days but on or before August 
1''). (See

[[Page 362]]

paragraph (b)(6) of this section for an exception to the provisions of 
this paragraph (b)(2) for returns that are not due on February 28 or 
March 15.) The total amount imposed on a person for all failures during 
any calendar year corrected after 30 days but on or before August 1 
shall not exceed $150,000.
    (3) Required filing date defined. The term ``required filing date'' 
means the date prescribed for filing an information return with the 
Internal Revenue Service (or the Social Security Administration in the 
case of Forms W-2) determined with regard to any extension of time for 
filing.
    (4) Penalty amount for return with multiple failures. If a return is 
subject to a penalty for more than one failure, and the penalty amounts 
for the failures differ, the higher penalty amount will be imposed.
    (5) Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) (1) through 
(4) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. These 
examples do not take into account any possible application of the de 
minimis exception under paragraph (d) of this section, the lower small 
business limitations under paragraph (e) of this section, the penalty 
for intentional disregard under paragraph (f) of this section, or the 
reasonable cause waiver under paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1:

    Example 1. Corporation R fails to file timely 11,000 Forms 1099-MISC 
(relating to miscellaneous income) for the 1990 calendar year. Five 
thousand of these returns are filed with correct information within 30 
days, and 6,000 after 30 days but on or before August 1, 1991. For the 
same year R fails to file timely 400 Forms 1099-INT (relating to 
payments of interest) which R eventually files on September 28, 1991, 
after the period for reduction of the penalty has elapsed. R is subject 
to a penalty of $20,000 for the 400 forms which were not filed by August 
1 ($50  x  400 = $20,000), $150,000 for the 6,000 forms filed after 30 
days ($30  x  6,000 = $180,000, limited to $150,000 under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section), and $75,000 for the 5,000 forms filed within 30 
days ($15  x  5,000 = $75,000), for a total penalty of $245,000.
    Example 2. Corporation T fails to file timely 6,000 Forms 1099-MISC 
for the 1990 calendar year. T files the 6000 Forms 1099-MISC on 
September 1, 1991. Because T does not correct the failure by August 1, 
1991, T is subject to a penalty of $250,000, the maximum penalty under 
paragraph (a) of this section. Without the limitation of paragraph (a), 
T would be subject to a $300,000 penalty ($50  x  6,000 = $300,000).
    Example 3. Corporation U files timely 300 Forms 1099-MISC on paper 
for the 1990 calendar year with correct information. Under section 
6011(e)(2) a person required to file at least 250 returns during a 
calendar year must file those returns on magnetic media. U does not 
correct its failures to file these returns on magnetic media by August 
1, 1991. It is therefore subject to a penalty for a failure to file 
timely under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. However, pursuant to 
section 6724(c) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the penalty for a 
failure to file timely on magnetic media applies only to the extent the 
number of returns exceeds 250. As U was required to file 300 returns on 
magnetic media, U is subject to a penalty of $2,500 for 50 returns ($50 
x  50 = $2,500).
    Example 4. Corporation V files 300 Forms 1099-MISC on paper for the 
1990 calendar year. The forms were filed on March 15, 1991, rather than 
on the required filing date of February 28,1991. Under Section 
6011(e)(2), a person required to file at least 250 returns during a 
calendar year must file those returns on magnetic media. V does not 
correctly file these returns on magnetic media by August 1, 1991. V is 
subject to a penalty of $3,750 for filing 250 of the returns late ($15 
x  250) and $2,500 for failing to file 50 returns on magnetic media ($50 
 x  50) for a total penalty of $6,250.

    (6) Application to returns not due on February 28, or March 15. For 
returns that are not due on February 28 or March 15 (for example, Forms 
8300 reporting certain cash payments of $10,000 or more), the penalty is 
$15 if the failure is corrected within 30 days. If the failure is 
corrected after 30 days, the penalty is $50 rather than $30. There is no 
period during which the penalty is reduced to $30 under paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (c) Exception for inconsequential errors or omissions--(1) In 
general. An inconsequential error or omission is not considered a 
failure to include correct information. For purposes of this paragraph 
(c)(1), the term ``inconsequential error or omission'' means any failure 
that does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from 
processing the return, from correlating the information required to be 
shown on the return with the information shown on the payee's tax 
return, or from otherwise putting the return to its intended use. See 
paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the definition of ``payee.''

[[Page 363]]

    (2) Errors or omissions that are never inconsequential. Errors or 
omissions relating to the following are never inconsequential--
    (i) A taxpayer identification number;
    (ii) A surname of a payee (i.e., the person required to be furnished 
a copy of the information set forth on an information return); and
    (iii) Any monetary amounts. The Internal Revenue Service may, by 
administrative pronouncement, specify other types of errors or omissions 
that are never inconsequential.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be 
illustrated by the following examples, which do not take into account 
any possible application of the penalty for intentional disregard under 
paragraph (f) of this section or the reasonable cause waiver under 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1:

    Example 1. A filer files a Form 1099-MISC (relating to miscellaneous 
income) with the Internal Revenue Service. The Form 1099-MISC is 
complete and correct except that the word ``street'' is misspelled in 
the payee's address. The error does not prevent or hinder the Internal 
Revenue Service from processing the return, from correlating the 
information required to be shown on the return with the information 
shown on the payee's tax return, or from otherwise putting the return to 
its intended use. Therefore, no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    Example 2. A filer files a Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue 
Service. The Form 1099-MISC is complete and correct except that the 
payee's first name, William, is misspelled as ``Willaim.'' the error 
does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from processing 
the return, from correlating the information required to be shown on the 
return with the information shown on the payee's tax return, or from 
otherwise putting the return to its intended use. See paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section. Therefore, no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    Example 3. A filer files a Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue 
Service. The Form 1099-MISC is complete and correct except that the 
payee's name, ``John Doe,'' is misspelled as ``John Ode.'' Under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, supplying an incorrect surname for a 
payee is never considered an inconsequential error. Therefore, a penalty 
is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.

    (d) Exception for a de minimis number of failures--(1) Requirements. 
The penalty under paragraph (a) of this section is not imposed for a de 
minimis number of failures to include correct information if the filer 
corrects such failures on or before August 1 of the year in which the 
required filing date occurs. (See paragraph (d)(4) of this section for 
special rules relating to returns that are not due on February 28 or 
March 15.)
    (2) Calculation of the de minimis exception. The number of returns 
to which the de minimis exception applies for any calendar year shall 
not exceed the greater of 10 or one-half of one percent of the total 
number of all information returns the filer is required to file during 
the year. If the number of returns on which the filer fails to include 
correct information exceeds the number of returns to which the de 
minimis exception applies, the de minimis exception applies to those 
returns that will afford the filer the greatest reduction in penalty. 
The de minimis exception applies to failures to include correct 
information that exist after the application (if any) of the waiver for 
reasonable cause under section 6724(a) and Sec. 301.6724-1. Returns to 
which the de minimis exception applies are treated as having been 
originally filed with correct information.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be 
illustrated by the following examples. In each of the examples, the 
failures to file and to include correct information are subject to 
penalty under paragraph (a) of this section. The examples do not take 
into account any possible application of paragraph (f) of this section 
or the reasonable cause waiver under paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1 of 
this section.

    Example 1. Corporation T files timely 10,000 Forms 1099-INT 
(relating to payments of interest) for 1990 by February 28, 1991. The 
10,000 returns are all the information returns that T is required to 
file during the 1991 calendar year. Of the returns filed, 70 contained 
incorrect information. T corrects the failures on July 12, 1991. No 
penalty is imposed for 50 of the failures (i.e., the greater of 10 or 
.005 x 10,000 = 50) even though the total failures, 70, exceed the 
number to which the de minimis exception may apply. The $30 penalty 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is imposed, in lieu of $50, for 
the remaining 20 failures, which were corrected after 30 days but on or 
before August 1, resulting in a total penalty of $600 ($30 x 20 = $600).

[[Page 364]]

    Example 2. Corporation U files timely 9,500 Forms 1099-INT for 1990 
by February 28, 1991, the required filing date. Fifty of these returns 
contain incorrect information with respect to which U files correct 
information on August 1, 1991. U also files 500 Forms 1099-INT for 1990 
on August 30, 1991, after the required filing date. The 10,000 returns 
are all the information returns that U is required to file during the 
1991 calendar year. The calculation of the de minimis exception is based 
on the 10,000 returns required to be filed during the 1991 calendar year 
even though 500 of the returns filed during the year were not filed 
timely. Therefore, the number of failures for which the de minimis 
exception applies is 50, and accordingly no penalty is imposed for the 
50 Forms 1099-INT that were corrected on August 1, 1991. However, the 
$50 penalty under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is imposed for each 
failure to file timely, resulting in a total penalty of $25,000 ($50 x 
500 = $25,000).
    Example 3. Corporation V files timely 9,950 Forms 1099-INT for 1990 
by February 28, 1991. However, V fails to file timely 50 of its Forms 
1099-INT. The 10,000 returns are all the information returns that V is 
required to file during the 1991 calendar year. Upon discovering the 
error, V files the 50 returns within 30 days of February 28, 1991. The 
50 returns are complete and correct except that V fails to include the 
taxpayer identification numbers of the payees on the returns. V files 
corrected returns on August 1, 1991. Absent application of the de 
minimis exception, the penalty imposed for the failure to include 
correct information would be $1,500 ($30 x 50 = $1,500). Because the 
incorrect returns are corrected on August 1, the 50 forms are treated 
under the de minimis exception as originally filed with correct 
information, and therefore no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of 
this section for the failure to include correct information. 
Nevertheless, the penalty under paragraph (a) of this section is imposed 
for the failure to file timely the 50 returns because the de minimis 
exception does not apply to the penalty for the failure to file timely. 
Hence, a penalty of $750 ($15 x 50 = $750) is imposed.
    Example 4. Corporation W files timely 100 Forms 1099-DIV and files 
an additional 50 Forms 1099-DIV late, but within 30 days of February 28, 
1991. These are all the information returns that W was required to file 
during the 1991 calendar year. W discovers errors on 10 of the returns 
that were filed timely, and on 5 of the returns that were filed late. W 
corrects all the errors on August 1. The de minimis exception applies to 
10 of the corrected returns. The exception will be allocated to the 10 
returns that were filed timely with incorrect information, because that 
allocation is most favorable to W (i.e., applying the exception to a 
return filed late with incorrect information would save W $15, by 
reducing the penalty on that return from $30 to $15, but applying the 
exception to a return filed timely would save W $30, by reducing the 
penalty on that return from $30 to $0). (See paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section.)

    (4) Nonapplication to returns not due on February 28 or March 15. 
The exception for a de minimis number of failures provided in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section does not apply to failures with respect to 
returns that are not due on February 28 or March 15 (for example, Forms 
8300 reporting certain cash payments of $10,000 or more). Nevertheless, 
the returns that are not due on February 28 or March 15 are included in 
the total number of all information returns that the filer is required 
to file during a year for purposes of calculating the number of the 
returns subject to the de minimis exception under paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (e) Lower limitations on the $250,000 maximum penalty amount with 
respect to persons with gross receipts of not more than $5,000,000--(1) 
In general. If a person meets the gross receipts test (as defined in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section) for any calendar year, the total 
amount of the penalty imposed on such person for all failures described 
in section 6721(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section during such 
calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. The total amount of the penalty 
imposed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for failures corrected 
within 30 days shall not exceed $25,000 for such calendar year. The 
total amount of the penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section for failures corrected after 30 days but on or before August 1 
shall not exceed $50,000 for such calendar year.
    (2) Gross receipts test. A person meets the gross receipts test for 
any calendar year if the average annual gross receipts for such person 
for the three most recent taxable years ending before such calendar year 
do not exceed $5,000,000. For purposes of determining the amount of 
gross receipts during the three most recent taxable years, the rules of 
section 448(c) (2) and (3) shall apply.
    (f) Higher penalty for intentional disregard of requirement to file 
timely correct information returns--(1) Application of

[[Page 365]]

section 6721(e). If a failure is due to intentional disregard of the 
requirement to file timely or to include correct information on a return 
as described in paragraph (g) of this section, the amount of the penalty 
imposed under paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined under 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (2) Meaning of ``intentional disregard.'' A failure is due to 
intentional disregard if it is a knowing or willful--
    (i) Failure to file timely, or
    (ii) Failure to include correct information. Whether a person 
knowingly or willfully fails to file timely or fails to include correct 
information is determined on the basis of all the facts and 
circumstances in the particular case.
    (3) Facts and circumstances considered. The facts and circumstances 
that are considered in determining whether a failure is due to 
intentional disregard include, but are not limited to--
    (i) Whether the failure to file timely or the failure to include 
correct information is part of a pattern of conduct by the person who 
filed the return of repeatedly failing to file timely or repeatedly 
failing to include correct information;
    (ii) Whether correction was promptly made upon discovery of the 
failure;
    (iii) Whether the filer corrects a failure to file or a failure to 
include correct information within 30 days after the date of any written 
request from the Internal Revenue Service to file or to correct; and
    (iv) Whether the amount of the information reporting penalties is 
less than the cost of complying with the requirement to file timely or 
to include correct information on an information return.
    (4) Amount of the penalty. If one or more failures to file timely or 
to include correct information are due to intentional disregard of the 
requirement to file timely or to include correct information, then, with 
respect to each such failure determined under this paragraph (f)--
    (i) Paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section shall not apply;
    (ii) The $250,000 limitation under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not apply, and the penalty under this paragraph (f) shall not be 
taken into account in applying the $250,000 limitation (or any similar 
limitation under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section) to penalties not 
determined under this paragraph (f);
    (iii) The penalty imposed under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
be $100 or, if greater, the statutory percentage; and
    (iv) The term ``statutory percentage'' means--
    (A) In the case of a return other than a return required under 
section 6045(a), 6041A(b), 6050H, 6050I (for amounts received after 
November 5, 1990), 6050J, 6050K, or 6050L, 10 percent of the aggregate 
dollar amount of the items required to be reported correctly,
    (B) In the case of a return required to be filed by section 6045(a), 
6050K, or 6050L, 5 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of the items 
required to be reported correctly, or
    (C) In the case of a return required to be filed under section 
6050I(a) with respect to amounts received after November 5, 1990, for 
any transaction (or related transactions), the greater of $25,000 or the 
amount of cash (within the meaning of section 6050I(d)) received in such 
transaction to the extent the amount of such cash does not exceed 
$100,000.
    (5) Computation of the penalty; aggregate dollar amount of the items 
required to be reported correctly. The aggregate dollar amount used in 
computing the penalty under this paragraph (f) is the amount that is not 
reported or is reported incorrectly. If the intentional disregard 
relates to a dollar amount, the statutory percentage is applied to the 
difference between the dollar amount reported and the amount required to 
be reported correctly. If the intentional disregard relates to any other 
item on the return, the statutory percentage is applied to the aggregate 
amount of items required to be reported correctly. In determining the 
aggregate amount of items required to be reported correctly, no item 
shall be taken into account more than once. For example, if a filer 
willfully fails to file a Form 1099-INT on which $800 of interest and 
$160 of Federal income tax withheld (i.e., backup withholding) is 
required to be reported, only the $800

[[Page 366]]

amount is taken into account in computing the penalty.
    (6) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (f) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On December 1, 1990, Automobile dealer P receives $55,000 
from an individual for the purchase of an automobile in a transaction 
subject to reporting under section 6050I. The individual presents 
documents to P that identify him as ``John Doe.'' However, P completes 
the Form 8300 (relating to cash received in a trade or business) and 
reflects the name of a cartoon character as the payor. Because P knew at 
the time of filing the Form 8300 that the payor's name was not the name 
of the cartoon character, he willfully failed to include correct 
information as described under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. 
Therefore, the penalty under paragraph (f)(4) of this section is imposed 
for the intentional disregard of the requirement to include correct 
information. The amount used in computing the penalty under paragraph 
(f)(5) of this section is $55,000 (i.e., the amount required to be 
reported on the return with respect to which the payee is not correctly 
identified). The amount of the penalty determined under paragraph 
(f)(4)(ii)(C) of this section is $55,000 (i.e., the greater of $25,000 
or the amount of cash received in the transaction up to $100,000).
    Example 2. On December 1, 1990, Individual B contacts his agent, F, 
to act as his intermediary in the purchase of an automobile. B gives F 
$20,000 and requests F to purchase the automobile in F's name, which F 
does. F prepares the Form 8300 as required under section 6050I, but in 
the area designated for the name of the payor, F writes 
``confidential.'' Because F knew at the time the return was filed that 
it contained incomplete information, the penalty under paragraph (f)(4) 
of this section is imposed for the intentional disregard of the 
requirement to include correct information. The amount used in computing 
the penalty under paragraph (f)(5) of this section is $20,000 (i.e., the 
amount required to be reported on the return with respect to which the 
payee is not correctly identified). The amount of the penalty determined 
under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(C) of this section is $25,000 (i.e., the 
greater of $25,000 or the amount of cash received in the transaction up 
to $100,000).
    Example 3. Corporation M deliberately does not include $5,000 of 
dividends on a Form 1099-DIV (relating to payments of dividends) on 
which a total of $200,000 (including the $5,000 dividends) is required 
to be reported under section 6042(a). Because the failure was 
deliberate, Corporation M's failure is due to intentional disregard of 
the requirement to include correct information. Accordingly, the amount 
of the penalty imposed under paragraph (a) is determined under paragraph 
(f)(4) of this section. Because the Form 1099-DIV is required to be 
filed under section 6042(a), under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) the amount of 
the penalty with respect to such failure is 10 percent of the aggregate 
dollar amount of the items that were required to be but that were not 
reported correctly. Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, $5,000 is 
the difference between the dollar amount reported and the amount 
required to be reported correctly. Therefore, the amount of the penalty 
is $500 ($5,000  x  .10 = $500).
    Example 4. Form 8027 requires certain large food and beverage 
establishments to report certain information with respect to tips. The 
form requires (among other things) that the establishment report its 
gross receipts from food and beverage operations. Establishment A, in 
intentional disregard of the information reporting requirement, reported 
gross receipts of $1,000,000, when the correct amount was $1,500,000. 
The significance of the gross receipts reporting requirement is that 
section 6053(c)(3)(A) requires an establishment to allocate as tips 
among its employees the excess of 8 percent of its gross receipts over 
the aggregate amount reported by employees to the establishment as tips 
under section 6053(a). A's misstatement of its gross receipts caused A 
to show $80,000 on the Form 8027 as 8 percent of its gross receipts, 
rather than the correct amount of $120,000. A correctly reported the 
amount of tips reported to it by employees under section 6053(a) as 
$80,000. Thus A reported the excess of 8 percent of its gross receipts 
over tips reported to it as zero, rather than as the correct amount of 
$40,000. The requirement of reporting gross receipts is considered 
merely a step in the computation of the excess of 8 percent of gross 
receipts over tips reported to A under section 6053(a), so that the 
penalty for intentional disregard will be $4,000 (i.e., 10 percent of 
the difference between the $40,000 required to be reported as the excess 
of 8 percent of gross receipts over tips reported under section 6053(a), 
and the zero amount actually reported).

    (g) Definitions--(1) Information return. For purposes of this 
section the term ``information return'' means any statement described in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, any return described in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section, and any other items described in paragraph 
(g)(4) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6722-1  Failure to furnish correct payee statements.

    (a) Imposition of penalty--(1) General rule. A penalty of $50 is 
imposed for each payee statement (as defined in section 6724(d)(2)) with 
respect to which a failure (as defined in section 6722(a) and paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section) occurs. No more than one penalty will be imposed 
under this paragraph (a) with respect to a single payee statement even 
though there may be more than one failure with respect to such 
statement. However, the penalty shall apply to failures on composite 
substitute payee statements as though each type of payment and other 
required information were furnished on separate statements. A 
``composite substitute payee statement'' is a single document created by 
a filer to reflect several types of payments made to the same payee. The 
total amount imposed on any person for all failures during any calendar 
year with respect to all payee statements shall not exceed $100,000. See 
section 6722(c) and paragraph (c) of this section for higher penalties 
when a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to 
furnish timely correct payee statements. See paragraph (a)(1) of 
Sec. 301.6724-1 for a waiver of the penalty for a failure that is due to 
reasonable cause.
    (2) Failures subject to the penalty. The failures to which section 
6722(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply are--
    (i) A failure to furnish a payee statement on or before the 
prescribed date therefore to the person to whom such statement is 
required to be furnished (``failure to furnish timely''), and
    (ii) A failure to include all of the information required to be 
shown on a payee statement or the inclusion of incorrect information 
(``failure to include correct information''). A failure to furnish 
timely includes a failure to furnish a written statement to the payee in 
a statement mailing as required under sections 6042(c), 6044(e), 
6049(c), and 6050N(b), as well as a failure to furnish the statement on 
a form acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, a failure to include correct information 
encompasses a failure to include the information required by applicable 
information reporting statutes or by any administrative pronouncements 
issued thereunder (such as regulations, revenue rulings, revenue 
procedures, or information reporting forms).
    (b) Exception for inconsequential errors or omissions--(1) In 
general. An inconsequential error or omission is not considered a 
failure to include correct information. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b), the term ``inconsequential error or omission'' means any failure 
that cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from 
timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her 
return or from otherwise putting the statement to its intended use.
    (2) Errors or omissions that are never inconsequential. Errors or 
omissions relating to the following are never inconsequential:
    (i) A dollar amount,
    (ii) The significant items in the address of a payee, which is the 
address provided by the payee to the filer,
    (iii) The appropriate form for the information provided (i.e., 
whether or not the form is an acceptable substitute for an official form 
of the Internal Revenue Service), and
    (iv) The manner of furnishing a statement required under sections 
6042(c), 6044(e), 6049(e), and 6050N(b). The Internal Revenue Service 
may, by administrative pronouncement, specify other types of errors or 
omissions that are never inconsequential.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be 
illustrated by the following examples which do not take into account any 
possible application of the penalty for intentional disregard under 
paragraph (c) of this section or the reasonable cause waiver under 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1:

    Example 1. A payor furnishes a statement with respect to a Form 
1099-MISC (relating to miscellaneous income). The payee statement is 
complete and correct, except the word ``boulevard'' is misspelled in the 
payee's address. The error cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or 
hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting 
it on his or her tax return or from

[[Page 369]]

otherwise putting the statement to its intended use. Therefore, no 
penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts in Example 1, except that the only 
error on the payee statement is that the payee's street address, 4821 
Grant Boulevard, is reported incorrectly as 8421 Grant Boulevard. A 
penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to 
the payee statement because the error can reasonably be expected to 
prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information 
and reporting it on his or her tax return or from otherwise putting the 
statement to its intended use.

    (c) Higher penalty for intentional disregard of requirement to 
furnish timely correct payee statements--(1) Application of section 
6722(c). If a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement 
to furnish timely correct payee statements, the amount of the penalty 
shall be determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Whether a 
failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to furnish 
timely correct payee statements is based upon the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the failure. The facts and circumstances 
considered include those under Sec. 301.6721-1(f)(3), which shall apply 
in determining whether a failure under this section is due to 
intentional disregard.
    (2) Amount of the penalty. If one or more failures under paragraph 
(a) of this section are due to intentional disregard of the requirement 
to furnish timely payee statements or of the requirement to include 
correct information, then, with respect to each such failure determined 
under this paragraph (c)(2)--
    (1) The $100,000 limitation under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not apply and the penalty under this paragraph (c)(2) shall not be 
taken into account in applying the $100,000 limitation to penalties not 
determined under this paragraph (c)(2);
    (ii) The penalty imposed under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
be $100 or, if greater, the statutory percentage; and
    (iii) The term ``statutory percentage'' means--
    (A) In the case of a payee statement other than a statement required 
under section 6045(b), 6041A(e) (in respect of a return required under 
section 6041A(b)), 6050H(d), 6050J(e), 6050K(b), or 6060L(c), 10 percent 
of the aggregate dollar amount of the items required to be reported 
correctly, or
    (B) In the case of a payee statement required under section 6045(b), 
6050K(b), or 6050L(c), 5 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of the 
items required to be reported correctly.
    (3) Computation of the penalty; aggregate dollar amount of items 
required to be shown correctly. The aggregate dollar amount used in 
computing the penalty under this paragraph (c) is the amount that is not 
reported or is reported incorrectly. If the intentional disregard 
relates to a dollar amount, the statutory percentage is applied to the 
difference between the dollar amount reported and the amount required to 
be reported correctly. If the intentional disregard relates to any other 
item on the return, the statutory percentage is applied to the aggregate 
amount of items required to be reported correctly. In determining such 
amount the same item shall be counted only once. For example, if a filer 
willfully fails to furnish a Form 1099-INT on which $800 of interest and 
$160 of Federal income tax withheld (i.e., backup withholding) is 
required to be shown, only the $800 amount is taken into account in 
computing the penalty.
    (d) Definitions--(1) Payee. See Sec. 301.6721-1(g)(5) for the 
definition of ``payee.''
    (2) Payee statement. The term ``payee statement'' means any 
statement required to be furnished under--
    (i) Section 6031(b) or (c), 6034A, or 6037(b) (relating to 
statements furnished by certain pass-thru entities, generally a Schedule 
K-1 (Form 1065) for section 6031(b) or (c), a copy of the Schedule K-1 
(Form 1041) for section 6034A, and a copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S) 
for section 6037(b)),
    (ii) Section 6039(a) (relating to information required in connection 
with certain options),
    (iii) Section 6041(d) (relating to information at source, generally 
the recipient copy of Form 1099-MISC, Form W-2, Form 1099-INT, and the 
winner's copies of Form W-2G),

dividends and corporate earnings and profits, generally the recipient

generally the recipient copy of Form 1099-B for broker transactions, the 
transferor copy of Form 1099-S for reporting proceeds from real estate 
transactions, and the recipient copy of Form 1099-MISC for certain 
substitute payments),
    (viii) Section 6049(c) (relating to returns regarding payments of 
interest, generally the recipient copy of Form 1099-INT),
    (ix) Section 6050A(b) (relating to reporting requirements of certain 
fishing boat operators, generally the recipient copy of Form 1099-MISC),
    (x) Section 6050H(d) (relating to returns relating to mortgage 
interest received in trade or business from individuals, generally the 
payor copy of Form 1098),
    (xi) Section 6050I(e) (relating to returns relating to cash received 
in trade or business, generally a copy of Form 8300),
    (xii) Section 6050J(e) (relating to returns relating to foreclosures 
and abandonments of security, generally the borrower copy of Form 1099-
A),
    (xiii) Section 6050K(b) (relating to returns relating to exchanges 
of certain partnership interests, generally a copy of Form 8308),

dispositions of donated property, generally a copy of Form 8282),
    (xv) Section 6050N(b) (relating to returns regarding payments of 
royalties, generally the recipient copy of Form 1099-MISC),
    (xvi) Section 6051 (relating to receipts for employees, generally

<R05>
Sec. 301.6723-1  Failure to comply with other information reporting requirements.

    (a) Imposition of penalty--(1) General rule. A penalty of $50 is 
imposed for each failure to comply timely with a specified information 
reporting requirement (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) 
or for each failure to include correct specified information. Multiple 
penalties are imposed with respect to a document with failures to comply 
with more than one of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section or multiple instances of failures to comply with any one of 
these requirements. Nonetheless, if a failure that occurs with respect 
to any requirement defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section would be 
subject to a penalty under both paragraph (a)(2)(i) and paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section, no more than one penalty is imposed for such 
failure. The total amount imposed on any person for all failures during 
any calendar year with respect to all specified information reporting 
requirements shall not exceed $100,000. See paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 301.6724-1 for the waiver of the penalty for a failure that is due 
to reasonable cause.

[[Page 371]]

    (2) Failures subject to the penalty. The failures to which paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section apply are--
    (i) A failure to comply timely with a specified information 
reporting requirement on or before the date prescribed therefor 
(``failure to comply timely''), and
    (ii) A failure to include all the information required by a 
specified information reporting requirement or the inclusion of 
incorrect information (``failure to include correct information'').
    (3) Exception for inconsequential errors or omissions. An 
inconsequential error or omission is not considered a failure to comply 
with a specified information reporting requirement. For purposes of 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, an error or omission is considered 
inconsequential if it does not frustrate the purpose or use for which 
the information is intended.
    (4) Specified information reporting requirement defined. For 
purposes of section 6723 and this section, a ``specified information 
reporting requirement'' means--
    (i) The requirement to provide the notice under section 6050K(c)(1) 
(relating to the requirement that a transferor notify the partnership of 
an exchange of a partnership interest);
    (ii) Any requirement contained in the regulations under section 6109 
that a person--
    (A) Include his or her taxpayer identification number (``TIN'') on 
any return, statement, or other document (other than an information 
return or payee statement),
    (B) Include on any return, statement, or other document (other than 
an information return or payee statement) made with respect to another 
person the TIN of such person, or
    (C) Furnish his or her TIN to another person;
    (iii) Any requirement contained in the regulations under section 215 
that a person--
    (A) Furnish his or her TIN to another person, or
    (B) Include on his or her return the TIN of another person; and
    (iv) The requirement under section 6109(e) that a person include the 
TIN of any dependent on his or her return.
    (b) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples which do not take into account the 
reasonable cause waiver under section 6724(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of 
Sec. 301.6724-1.

    Example 1. Individual A, who has two dependents ages 7 and 9, files 
his 1990 Form 1040 in 1991. The Form 1040 requires him to provide the 
TINs of his two dependents, which A fails to do. Because A fails to 
comply timely with two requirements to include on his return the TIN of 
another person, a $50 penalty under paragraph (a) of this section is 
imposed on A for each of the two failures, for a total penalty of $100.
    Example 2. In 1991 Individual B opens with Bank X an account which 
pays reportable interest under section 6049. When B opens the account, 
Bank X requests that B provide his TIN on a Form W-9. B does not provide 
his TIN as required by Sec. 301.6109-1(b). As a result B fails to comply 
timely with a specified information reporting requirement under 
paragraph (a) of this section for furnishing his TIN to another person. 
Therefore, a $50 penalty is imposed on B under paragraph (a) of this 
section for the failure. See section 6721(a) for the penalty to which X 
may be subject if X files a Form 1099-INT (relating to payments of 
interest) for calendar year 1991 without B's TIN. See section 
3406(a)(1)(A) which requires X to impose backup withholding on 
reportable payments of interest to B's account.
    Example 3. In 1991 Individual C is a nonresident alien with an 
account inside the U.S. with Bank Z. The account pays interest that 
would be reportable under section 6049 but for the fact that it is paid 
to a nonresident alien. Under section 6109 and Sec. 301.6109-1(b), Bank 
Z is required to request the TIN from C. C claims that he is a 
nonresident alien and that his account is not subject to information 
reporting under section 6049. Because of this, C contends he is not 
required to provide any TIN information. As a result of this discussion, 
Bank Z then requests C to provide it with a Form W-8 in order for C to 
certify that he is a nonresident alien which C fails to do. C fails to 
comply timely with a specified information reporting requirement under 
paragraph (a) of this section to furnish his TIN to another person. 
Therefore, a penalty is imposed on C under paragraph (a) of this section 
for the failure. See section 6721(a) for the penalty that may be imposed 
on Z if Z files a Form 1099-INT for calendar year 1991 without C's TIN. 
See section 3406(a)(1)(A) under which Z is required to impose backup 
withholding on reportable payment of interest to C's account.
    Example 4. In 1991 Partnership D opens with Bank Y an account that 
pays reportable interest under section 6049. When D opens the

[[Page 372]]

account, Y requests the partnership's employer identification number 
(EIN) on a Form W-9 as required under Sec. 301.6109-1(b). The 
partnership provides its EIN on the Form W-9. Y files an information 
return with respect to D for the 1991 calendar year. Subsequently, the 
Internal Revenue Service later notifies Y that D's EIN is incorrect as 
defined under section 3406 and Sec. 35a.3406-1(a)(6). D fails to comply 
timely with a specified reporting requirement under paragraph (a) of 
this section of furnishing its correct EIN to another person. Therefore, 
a penalty is imposed on D under paragraph (a) of this section for the 
failure. See section 6721(a) for the penalty to which Y may be subject 
if Y files a Form 1099-INT for calendar year 1991 without D's correct 
EIN. See section 3406(a)(1)(B), which requires Y to impose backup 
withholding on reportable payments of interest to B's account when the 
Internal Revenue Service or a broker has notified Y that the EIN is 
incorrect.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6724-1  Reasonable cause.

    (a) Waiver of the penalty--(1) General rule. The penalty for a 
failure relating to an information reporting requirement (as defined in 
paragraph (j) of this section) is waived if the failure is due to 
reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
    (2) Reasonable cause defined. The penalty is waived for reasonable 
cause only if the filer establishes that either--
    (i) There are significant mitigating factors with respect to the 
failure, as described in paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (ii) The failure arose from events beyond the filer's control 
(``impediment''), as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    Moreover, the filer must establish that the filer acted in a 
responsible manner, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, both 
before and after the failure occurred. Thus, if the filer establishes 
that there are significant mitigating factors for a failure but is 
unable to establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner, the 
mitigating factors will not be sufficient to obtain a waiver of the 
penalty. Similarly, if the filer establishes that a failure arose from 
an impediment but is unable to establish that the filer acted in a 
responsible manner, the impediment will not be sufficient to obtain a 
waiver of the penalty. See paragraph (g) of this section for the 
reasonable cause safe harbor for persons who exercise due diligence.
    (b) Significant mitigating factors. In order to establish reasonable 
cause under this paragraph (b), the filer must satisfy paragraph (d) of 
this section and must show that there are significant mitigating factors 
for the failure. The mitigating factors include, but are not limited 
to--
    (1) The fact that prior to the failure the filer was never required 
to file the particular type of return or furnish the particular type of 
statement with respect to which the failure occurred, or
    (2) The fact that the filer has an established history of complying 
with the information reporting requirement with respect to which the 
failure occurred. In determining whether the filer has such an 
established history, significant consideration is given to--
    (i) Whether the filer has incurred any penalty under Secs. 301.6721-
1, 301.6722-1, or 301.6723-1 in prior years for the failure (or under 
parallel provisions of prior law), and
    (ii) If the filer has incurred any such penalty in prior years, the 
extent of the filer's success in lessening its error rate from year to 
year.
    A filer may treat as a penalty not incurred any penalty under 
sections 6721 through 6723 that was self-assessed under section 
6724(c)(3) and any penalty under section 6676(b) that was self-assessed 
under section 6676(d), prior to amendment or repeal by the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section 
for the application of this paragraph (b) to failures attributable to 
the actions of a filer's agent.
    (c) Events beyond the filer's control--(1) In general. In order to 
establish reasonable cause under this paragraph (c)(1), the filer must 
satisfy paragraph (d) of this section and must show that the failure was 
due to events beyond the filer's control. Events which are generally 
considered beyond the filer's control include but are not limited to--
    (i) The unavailability of the relevant business records (as 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section),
    (ii) An undue economic hardship relating to filing on magnetic media 
(as

[[Page 373]]

described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section),
    (iii) Certain actions of the Internal Revenue Service (as described 
in paragraph (c)(4) of this section),
    (iv) Certain actions of an agent (as described in paragraph (c)(5) 
of this section), and
    (v) Certain actions of the payee or any other person providing 
necessary information with respect to the return or payee statement (as 
described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section).
    (2) Unavailability of the relevant business records. In order to 
establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to 
the unavailability of the relevant business records, the filer's 
business records must have been unavailable under such conditions, in 
such manner, and for such period as to prevent timely compliance 
(ordinarily at least a 2-week period prior to the due date (with regard 
to extensions) of the required return or the required date (with regard 
to extensions) for furnishing the payee statement), and the 
unavailability must have been caused by a supervening event. A 
``supervening event'' includes, but is not limited to--
    (i) A fire or other casualty that damages or impairs the filer's 
relevant business records or the filer's system for processing and 
filing such records;
    (ii) A statutory or regulatory change that has a direct impact upon 
data processing and that is made so close to the time that the return or 
payee statement is required that, for all practical purposes, the change 
cannot be complied with; or
    (iii) The unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious 
illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for filing a return 
or furnishing a payee statement.
    (3) Undue economic hardship relating to filing on magnetic media. In 
order to establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section due to an undue economic hardship for filing on magnetic media, 
the filer must show that it failed to file on magnetic media because the 
filer lacked the necessary hardware. For purposes of this paragraph 
(c)(3), the filer will not be considered to have acted in a responsible 
manner under paragraph (d) of this section unless--
    (i) The filer attempted on a timely basis to contract out the 
magnetic media filing;
    (ii) The cost of filing on magnetic media was prohibitive as 
determined at least 45 days before the due date of the returns (without 
regard to extensions) (90 days for information returns the due date for 
which (without regard to extensions) is after December 31, 1989, and by 
or before February 28, 1991 (March 15, 1991, for Forms 1042S));
    (iii) The cost was supported by a minimum of two cost estimates from 
unrelated parties; and
    (iv) The filer filed the returns on paper. Reasonable cause will not 
ordinarily be established under this paragraph (c)(3) if a filer 
received a reasonable cause waiver in any prior year under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section due to an undue economic hardship relating to 
filing on magnetic media.
    (4) Actions of the Internal Revenue Service. In order to establish 
reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to certain 
actions of the Internal Revenue Service, a filer must show that the 
failure was due to the filer's reasonable reliance on erroneous written 
information from the Internal Revenue Service. Reasonable reliance means 
that the filer relied in good faith on the information. The filer shall 
not be considered to have relied in good faith if the Internal Revenue 
Service was not aware of all the facts when it provided the information 
to the filer. In order to substantiate reasonable cause under this 
paragraph (c)(4), the filer must provide a copy of the written 
information provided by the Internal Revenue Service and, if applicable, 
the filer's written request for the information.
    (5) Actions of agent--imputed reasonable cause. In order to 
establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to 
actions of an agent, the filer must show the following:
    (i) The filer exercised reasonable business judgment in contracting 
with the agent to file timely correct returns or furnish timely correct 
payee statements with respect to which the failure occurred. This 
includes contracting

[[Page 374]]

with the agent and providing the proper information sufficiently in 
advance of the due date of the return or statement to permit timely 
filing of correct returns or timely furnishing of correct payee 
statements; and
    (ii) The agent satisfied the reasonable cause criteria set forth in 
paragraph (b) or one of the reasonable cause criteria set forth in 
paragraph (c) (2) through (6) of this section.
    (6) Actions of the payee or any other person. In order to establish 
reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to actions 
of the payee or any other person, such as a broker as defined in section 
6045(c), providing information with respect to the return or payee 
statement, the filer must show either--
    (i) That the failure resulted from the failure of the payee, or any 
other person required to provide information necessary for the filer to 
comply with the information reporting requirements (``any other 
person''), to provide information to the filer, or
    (ii) That the failure resulted from incorrect information provided 
by the payee (or any other person) upon which information the filer 
relied in good faith. To substantiate reasonable cause under this 
paragraph (c)(6), the filer must provide documentary evidence upon 
request of the Internal Revenue Service showing that the failure was 
attributable to the payee (or any other person). See paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section for special rules relating to the availability of a waiver 
where the filer's failure relates to a taxpayer identification number 
(TIN), and the failure is attributable to actions of the payee described 
in paragraph (c)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section.
    (d) Responsible manner--(1) In general. Acting in a responsible 
manner means--
    (i) That the filer exercised reasonable care, which is that standard 
of care that a reasonably prudent person would use under the 
circumstances in the course of its business in determining its filing 
obligations and in handling account information such as account numbers 
and balances, and
    (ii) That the filer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate 
the failure, including, where applicable--
    (A) Requesting appropriate extensions of time to file, when 
practicable, in order to avoid the failure,
    (B) Attempting to prevent an impediment or a failure, if it was 
foreseeable,
    (C) Acting to remove an impediment or the cause of a failure, once 
it occurred, and
    (D) Rectifying the failure as promptly as possible once the 
impediment was removed or the failure was discovered. Ordinarily, a 
rectification is considered prompt if it is made within 30 days after 
the date the impediment is removed or the failure is discovered or on 
the earliest date thereafter on which a regular submission of 
corrections is made. Submissions will be considered regular only if made 
at intervals of 30 days or less. A failure may be rectified by filing or 
correcting the information return, furnishing or correcting the payee 
statement, or by providing or correcting the information to satisfy the 
specified information reporting requirement with respect to which the 
failure occurs. Paragraph (d)(ii)(D) of this section does not apply with 
respect to information the filer is prohibited from altering under 
specific information reporting rules. See Sec. 1.6045-4(i)(5) of this 
chapter.
    (2) Special rule for filers seeking a waiver pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(6) of this section. A filer seeking a waiver for reasonable cause 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section with respect to a failure 
resulting from a missing or an incorrect TIN will be deemed to have 
acted in a responsible manner in compliance with this paragraph (d) only 
if the filer satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section 
(relating to missing TINs) or paragraph (f) of this section (relating to 
incorrect TINs), whichever is applicable.
    (e) Acting in a responsible manner--special rules for missing TINs--
(1) In general. A filer that is seeking a waiver for reasonable cause 
under paragraph (c)(6) of this section will satisfy paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section with respect to establishing that a failure to include a 
TIN or an information return resulted from the failure of the payee to 
provide information to the filer (i.e., a missing TIN) only if the filer 
makes the initial and, if required, the annual solicitations described 
in this paragraph (e)

[[Page 375]]

(required solicitations). For purposes of this section, a number is 
treated as a ``missing TIN'' if the number does not contain nine digits 
or includes one or more alpha characters (a character or symbol other 
than an Arabic numeral) as one of the nine digits. A solicitation means 
a request by the filer for the payee to furnish a correct TIN. See 
paragraph (f) of this section for the rules that a filer must follow to 
establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner with respect to 
providing incorrect TINs on information returns. See paragraph 
(e)(1)(vi)(A) of this section for alternative solicitation requirements. 
See paragraph (g) of this section for the safe harbor due diligence 
rules. See paragraph (h) of this section for the rule applicable to 
failures with respect to information returns the due date for which 
(without regard to extensions) is after December 31, 1989, and on or 
before April 22, 1991.
    (i) Initial solicitation. An initial solicitation for a payee's 
correct TIN must be made at the time an account is opened. The term 
``account'' includes accounts, relationships, and other transactions. 
However, a filer is not required to make an initial solicitation under 
this paragraph (e)(1)(i) with respect to a new account if the filer has 
the payee's TIN and uses that TIN for all accounts of the payee. For 
example, see Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(a) of this chapter. Further, a filer is 
not required to make an initial solicitation under this paragraph 
(e)(1)(i) with respect to accounts for which the filer filed an 
information return subject to paragraph (h) of this section. For 
purposes of this section, the initial solicitation requirement is deemed 
to have been met with respect to accounts opened after December 31, 
1989, and on or before April 22, 1991. If the account is opened in 
person, the initial solicitation may be made by oral or written request, 
such as on an account creation document. If the account is opened by 
mail, telephone, or other electronic means, the TIN may be requested 
through such communications. If the account is opened by the payee's 
completing and mailing an application furnished by the filer that 
requests the payee's TIN, the initial solicitation requirement is 
considered met. If a TIN is not received as a result of an initial 
solicitation, the filer may be required to make additional solicitations 
(``annual solicitations'').
    (ii) First annual solicitation. Except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(1)(vi) of this section, a filer must undertake an annual 
solicitation if a TIN is not received as a result of an initial 
solicitation (or if the filer was not required to make an initial 
solicitation under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and the filer has 
not received a payee's TIN). The first annual solicitation must be made 
on or before December 31 of the year in which the account is opened (for 
accounts opened before December) or January 31 of the following year 
(for accounts opened in the preceding December) (``annual solicitation 
period'').
    (iii) Second annual solicitation. If the TIN is not received as a 
result of the first annual solicitation, the filer must undertake a 
second annual solicitation. The second annual solicitation must be made 
after the expiration of the annual solicitation period and on or before 
December 31 of the year immediately succeeding the calendar year in 
which the account is opened.
    (iv) Additional requirements. After receiving a TIN, a filer must 
include that TIN on any information returns the original due date of 
which (with regard to extensions) is after the date that the filer 
receives the TIN.
    (v) Failures to which a solicitation relates. The initial and first 
annual solicitations relate to failures on returns filed for the year in 
which an account is opened. The second annual solicitation relates to 
failures on returns filed for the year immediately following the year in 
which an account is opened and for succeeding calendar years.
    (vi) Exceptions and limitations. (A) The solicitation requirements 
under this paragraph (e) do not apply to the extent an information 
reporting provision under which a return, as defined in paragraph (g) of 
Sec. 301.6721-1, is filed provides specific requirements relating to the 
manner or the time period in which a TIN must be solicited. In that 
event, the requirements of this paragraph (e) will be satisfied only if 
the filer complies with the manner and time period

[[Page 376]]

requirements of the specific information reporting provision and the 
provisions of this paragraph (e) to the extent applicable. Also, see 
section 3406(e) which provides rules on the manner and time period in 
which a TIN must be provided for certain accounts with respect to 
interest, dividends, patronage dividends, and amounts subject to broker 
reporting.
    (B) An annual solicitation is not required to be made for a year 
under this paragraph (e) with respect to an account if no payments are 
made to the account for such year or if no return as defined in 
paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6721-1 is required to be filed for the account 
for the year.
    (C) If a filer fails to make one (or more) of the required 
solicitations under paragraphs (e)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this 
section, the filer may satisfy the requirements of this section by--
    (1) Making two consecutive annual solicitations in subsequent years 
(``make-up solicitations''), and
    (2) Satisfying paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section.
    For example, a filer who has made none of the required solicitations 
may satisfy the requirements of this section by making two consecutive 
solicitations. In determining whether a filer has made two consecutive 
solicitations, years to which paragraph (e)(1)(vi)(B) of this section 
applies shall be disregarded. If a filer fails to make the initial 
solicitation under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the make-up 
solicitations described in this paragraph (e)(1)(vi)(C) may be made in 
the years in which the first and second annual solicitations are 
required to be made; however, the penalty will apply with respect to the 
year in which the filer failed to make the initial solicitation. The 
penalty will apply to failures with respect to years for which a 
required solicitation is not made and to failures with respect to all 
subsequent years until the filer conducts its make-up solicitations. The 
penalty will not apply with respect to the year in which the first make-
up solicitation is made (unless it is also the year in which the filer 
fails to make its initial solicitation) if the second make-up 
solicitation is made in the following year.
    (D) A financial institution is not required to make an annual 
solicitation by mail on accounts with ``stop-mail'' or ``hold-mail'' 
instructions, provided the filer furnishes the solicitation material to 
the payee in the same manner as it furnishes other mail.
    (E) A filer is not required to make annual solicitations on accounts 
with respect to which the filer undertook two consecutive annual 
mailings by December 31, 1989, under Q/A-5 through Q/A-7B or under Q/A-
56 of Sec. 35a.9999-1 of the Temporary Employment Tax Regulations under 
the Interest and Dividend Tax Compliance Act of 1983, as provided under 
section 6676(b) (prior to its amendment by the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1989).
    (F) A filer is not required to make annual solicitations by mail on 
accounts with respect to which the filer has an undeliverable address, 
i.e., where other mailings to that address have been returned to the 
filer because the address was incorrect and no new address has been 
provided to the filer.
    (G) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(vi) (A) and (C) of this 
section, no more than two annual solicitations are required under this 
paragraph (e) in order for a filer to establish reasonable cause.
    (2) Manner of making annual solicitations--by mail or telephone--(i) 
By mail. A mail solicitation must include--
    (A) A letter informing the payee that he or she must provide his or 
her TIN and that he or she is subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the 
Internal Revenue Service under section 6723 if he or she fails to 
furnish his or her TIN,
    (B) A Form W-9 or an acceptable substitute form, as defined in 
Sec. 31.3406 (h)-3 (a), (b), or (c) of this chapter, on which the payee 
may provide the TIN, and
    (C) A return envelope for the payee to provide the TIN which may be, 
but is not required to be, postage prepaid.
    (ii) By telephone. An annual solicitation may be made by telephone 
if the solicitation procedure is reasonably designed and carried out in 
a manner that is conducive to obtaining the TIN. An annual solicitation 
is made pursuant to this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) for a failure if the 
filer--

[[Page 377]]

    (A) Completes a call to each person with a missing TIN and speaks to 
an adult member of the household, or to an officer of the business or 
the organization,
    (B) Requests the TIN of the payee,
    (C) Informs the payee that he or she is subject to a $50 penalty 
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service under section 6723 if he or she 
fails to furnish his or her TIN,
    (D) Maintains contemporaneous records showing that the solicitation 
was properly made, and
    (E) Provides such contemporaneous records to the Internal Revenue 
Service upon request.
    (f) Acting in a responsible manner--special rules for incorrect 
TINS--(1) In general. A filer that is seeking a waiver for reasonable 
cause under paragraph (c)(6) of this section will satisfy paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section with respect to establishing that a failure 
resulted from incorrect information provided by the payee or any other 
person (i.e., inclusion of an incorrect TIN) on an information return 
only if the filer makes the initial and annual solicitations described 
in this paragraph (f). See paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the 
definition of the term ``solicitation.'' See paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this 
section for alternative solicitation requirements. See paragraph (g) of 
this section for the safe harbor due diligence rules. See paragraph (h) 
of this section for the rule applicable to failures with respect to 
information returns the due date for which (without regard to 
extensions) is after December 31, 1989, and on or before April 22, 1991.
    (i) Initial solicitation. An initial solicitation for a payee's 
correct TIN must be made at the time the account is opened. The term 
``account'' includes accounts, relationships, and other transactions. 
However, a filer is not required to make an initial solicitation under 
this paragraph (f)(1)(i) with respect to a new account if the filer has 
the payee's TIN and uses that TIN for all accounts of the payee. For 
example, see Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(a) of this chapter. Further, a filer is 
not required to make an initial solicitation under this paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) with respect to accounts for which the filer filed an 
information return subject to paragraph (h) of this section. For 
purposes of this section, the initial solicitation requirement is deemed 
to have been met with respect to accounts opened after December 31, 
1989, and on or before April 22, 1991. No additional solicitation is 
required after the filer receives the TIN unless the Internal Revenue 
Service or, in some cases, a broker notifies the filer that the TIN is 
incorrect. Following such notification the filer may be required to make 
an annual solicitation to obtain the correct TIN as provided in 
paragraph (f)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (ii) First annual solicitation. Except as provided in paragraph 
(f)(5) of this section, a filer must undertake an annual solicitation 
only if the payor has been notified of an incorrect TIN and such account 
contains the incorrect TIN at the time of the notification. The first 
annual solicitation must be made as required by paragraph (f) (2) or (3) 
of this section, whichever applies. An account contains an incorrect TIN 
at the time of notification if the name and number combination on the 
account matches the name and number combination set forth on the notice 
from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker. A filer may be notified 
of an incorrect TIN by the Internal Revenue Service or by a broker 
pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) or by a penalty notice issued by the 
Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 6721(n). Except as 
otherwise provided in this section, the annual solicitation required by 
this paragraph (f) must be made on or before December 31 of the year in 
which the filer is notified of the incorrect TIN or by January 31 of the 
following year if the filer is notified of an incorrect TIN in the 
preceding December.
    (iii) Second annual solicitation. A filer must undertake a second 
annual solicitation as required by paragraph (f) (2) or (3) of this 
section, whichever applies, if the filer is notified in any year 
following the year of the notification described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) 
of this section that the account of a payee contains an incorrect TIN, 
as described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Additional requirements. Upon receipt of a TIN, a filer must 
include that TIN on any information returns the original due date of 
which (with regard

[[Page 378]]

to extensions) is after the date that the filer receives the TIN.
    (2) Manner of making annual solicitation if notified pursuant to 
section 3406(a)(1)(B). A filer that has been notified of an incorrect 
name/TIN combination pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) (except filers to 
which Sec. 31.3406(d)-5(b)(4)(i)(A) of this chapter applies) will 
satisfy the solicitation requirement of this paragraph (f) only if it 
makes a solicitation in the manner and within the time period required 
under Sec. 31.3406(d)-5 (d)(2)(i) or (g)(1)(ii) of this chapter, 
whichever applies. Section 31.3406(d)-5 (d)(2)(i) and (g)(1)(ii) of this 
chapter generally requires that filer to notify a payee that the payee's 
account contains an incorrect taxpayer identification number within 15 
business days after the date of the notice from the Internal Revenue 
Service or a broker.
    (3) Manner of making annual solicitation if notified pursuant to 
section 6721. A filer that has been notified of an incorrect TIN by a 
penalty notice or other notification issued pursuant to section 6721 and 
that has received no effective notice pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) 
during the same calendar year (or is a filer to which Sec. 31.3406(d)-
5(b)(4)(i)(A) of this chapter applies) may satisfy the solicitation 
requirement of this paragraph (f) either by mail, in the manner set 
forth in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, or by telephone, in the 
manner set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, or by 
requesting the TIN in person.
    (4) Failures to which a solicitation relates. The initial 
solicitation relates to failures on returns filed for the year an 
account is opened and for any succeeding year that precedes the year in 
which the filer receives a notification of an incorrect TIN. The first 
and second annual solicitations relate to failures on returns filed for 
the year in which a notification of an incorrect TIN is received. The 
second solicitation also relates to failures on returns filed for 
succeeding calendar years.
    (5) Exceptions and limitations.--(i) The solicitation requirements 
under this paragraph (f) do not apply to the extent that an information 
reporting provision under which a return, as defined in paragraph (g) of 
Sec. 301.6721-1, is filed provides specific requirements relating to the 
manner or the time period in which a TIN must be solicited. In that 
event, the requirements of this paragraph (f) will be satisfied only if 
the filer complies with the manner and time period requirement under the 
specific information reporting provisions and this paragraph (f), to the 
extent applicable.
    (ii) An annual solicitation is not required to be made for a year 
under this paragraph (f) with respect to an account if no payments are 
made to the account for such year or if no return as defined in 
paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6721-1 is required to be filed for the account 
for such year.
    (iii) If a filer fails to make one (or more) of the required 
solicitations under paragraph (f)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this 
section, the filer may satisfy the requirements of this section by:
    (A) Making two consecutive annual solicitations in subsequent years 
(``make-up solicitations''), and
    (B) Satisfying paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.
    For example, a filer who has made none of the required solicitations 
may satisfy the requirements of this section by making two consecutive 
solicitations. In determining whether a filer has made two consecutive 
solicitations, years to which paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section 
applies are disregarded. If a filer fails to make the initial 
solicitation under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the make-up 
solicitations described in this paragraph (f)(5)(iii) may be made in the 
years in which the first and second annual solicitations are required to 
be made; however, the penalty will apply with respect to the year in 
which the filer failed to make the initial solicitation. The penalty 
will apply to failures in years in which a required solicitation is not 
made and to failures with respect to all subsequent years until the 
filer conducts its make-up solicitations. The penalty will not apply 
with respect to the year in which the first make-up solicitation is made 
(unless it is also the year in which the filer fails to make the initial 
solicitation) if the second make-up solicitation is made in the 
following year.
    (iv) A financial institution is not required to make an annual 
solicitation

[[Page 379]]

by mail on accounts with ``stop-mail'' or ``hold-mail'' instructions, 
provided the filer furnishes the solicitation material to the payee in 
the same manner as it furnishes other mail.
    (v) A filer is not required to make annual solicitations by mail on 
accounts with respect to which the filer has an undeliverable address, 
i.e., where other mailings to that address have been returned to the 
filer because the address was incorrect and no new address has been 
provided to the filer.
    (vi) In general, except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) (i) and 
(iii) of this section, no more than two annual solicitations are 
required under this paragraph (f) in order for a filer to establish 
reasonable cause. However, a filer who complies with this paragraph (f) 
during a calendar year after receiving a notice under section 6721 and 
who later during the same calendar year receives a notice pursuant to 
section 3406 may be required to undertake additional annual mailings in 
such calendar year pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) in order to satisfy 
the annual solicitation requirement in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (g) Due diligence safe harbor. A filer may establish reasonable 
cause with respect to a failure relating to an information reporting 
requirement as described in paragraph (j) of this section for any return 
defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6721-1 if the filer exercises due 
diligence as provided under section 6724(c)(1) with respect to failures 
described in sections 6721 through 6723 and under section 6676(b) and 
the Temporary Employment Tax Regulations related thereto issued under 
the Interest and Dividend Tax Compliance Act of 1983 (with respect to a 
failure to provide a correct TIN) (Sec. 35a.9999-1 of this chapter et 
seq.) as in effect on December 31, 1989 (prior to amendment or repeal of 
these sections by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989).
    (h) Transitional rules for information returns required to be filed 
(or payee statements required to be furnished) after December 31, 1989 
(without regard to extensions), and on or before April 22, 1991--(1) In 
general. With respect to information returns required to be filed (or 
payee statements required to be furnished) after December 31, 1989 
(without regard to extensions), and on or before April 22, 1991, a filer 
will be deemed to have satisfied reasonable cause if, with respect to 
the failure, the filer would have satisfied reasonable cause under 
sections 6721, 6722, or 6723 (prior to their amendment by the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989) and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) Special rule on TINs. With respect to information returns 
required to be filed after December 31, 1989 (without regard to 
extensions), and on or before April 22, 1991, which contain a missing or 
an incorrect TIN, a filer will be deemed to have satisfied reasonable 
cause if, at the time the account was opened, the filer--
    (i) Exercised due diligence or fulfilled the requirements of Q/A-56 
of Sec. 35a.9999-1 of this chapter, as in effect on December 31, 1989, 
as provided under section 6676(b) (prior to its repeal by the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989),
    (ii) Requested the TIN according to the regulations under the 
section requiring the filing of the information return, but if none, 
under section 6109, or
    (iii) Would have satisfied reasonable cause under section 6676(a) 
(prior to its repeal by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989).
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Failures to which this section relates. For purposes of this 
section, a failure relating to an information reporting requirement 
means--
    (1) A failure described under Sec. 301.6721-1(a)(2) relating to the 
failure to file timely correct information returns as defined in section 
6724(d)(1),
    (2) A failure described under Sec. 301.6722-1(a)(2) relating to the 
failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement as defined in 
section 6724(d)(2), and
    (3) A failure described under Sec. 301.6723-1(a)(2) relating to the 
failure to timely comply with and to include correct specified 
information as defined in section 6724(d)(3).
    (k) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) On August 1, 1991, Individual A, an independent 
contractor, establishes a relationship (``an account'') with Institution 
L, which pays A amounts reportable under

[[Page 380]]

section 6041. When A opens the account L requests that A supply his TIN 
on the account creation document. A fails to provide his TIN. On October 
1, 1991, L mails a solicitation for A's TIN that satisfies the 
requirement of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. A does not provide 
a TIN to L during 1991. L timely files an information return subject to 
section 6721, that does not contain A's TIN, for payments made during 
the 1991 calendar year with respect to A's account. A penalty is imposed 
on L pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for L's failure to 
file a correct information return because A's TIN was not shown on the 
return. The penalty will be waived, however, if L establishes that the 
failure was due to reasonable cause as defined in this section.
    (ii) To establish reasonable cause under this section, L must 
satisfy both paragraphs (c)(6) and (d) of this section. The criteria for 
obtaining a waiver under these paragraphs are as follows:
    (A) L acted in a responsible manner in attempting to satisfy the 
information reporting requirement as described in paragraph (d) of this 
section, and
    (B) L demonstrates that the failure arose from events beyond L's 
control, as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
    (iii) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, L may 
demonstrate that it acted in a responsible manner only by complying with 
paragraph (e) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section requires a 
filer to request a TIN at the time the account is opened (the initial 
solicitation) and, if the filer does not receive the TIN at that time, 
to solicit the TIN on or before December 31 of the year the account is 
opened (for accounts opened before December) or January 31 of the 
following year (for accounts in the preceding December) (the annual 
solicitation). Because L has performed these solicitations within the 
time and in the manner prescribed by paragraph (e) of this section, L 
has acted in a responsible manner as described in paragraph (d) of this 
section. L satisfies paragraph (c)(6) of this section because under the 
facts, L can show that the failure was caused by A's failure to provide 
a TIN, an event beyond L's control. As a result, L has established 
reasonable cause under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Therefore, the 
penalty imposed under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for the 
failure on the 1991 information return is waived. See section 
3406(a)(1)(A) which requires L to impose backup withholding on 
reportable payments to A if L has not received A's TIN.
    Example 2. (i) On August 1, 1991, Individual B opens an account with 
Bank M, which pays B interest reportable under section 6049. When B 
opens the account, M requests that B supply his TIN on the account 
creation document. B provides his TIN to M. On February 28, 1992, M 
includes the TIM that B provided on the Form 1099-INT for the 1991 
calendar year. In October 1992 the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to 
section 3406(a)(1)(B), notifies M that the 1991 return filed for B 
contains an incorrect TIN. In April 1993 a penalty is imposed on M 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for M's failure to file 
a correct information return for the 1991 calendar year, i.e., the 
return did not contain B's correct TIN. The penalty will be waived, 
however, if M establishes that the failure was due to reasonable cause 
as defined in this section.
    (ii) To establish reasonable cause under this section, M must 
satisfy the criteria in both paragraphs (c)(6) and (d) of this section. 
Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, M can demonstrate that it 
acted in a responsible manner only if M complies with paragraph (f) of 
this section. Paragraph (f) of this section requires a filer to request 
a TIN at the time the account is opened, an initial solicitation. Under 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section the initial solicitation relates to 
failures on returns filed for the year an account is opened. Because M 
performed the initial solicitation in 1991 in the time and manner 
prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and reflected the TIM 
received from B on the 1991 return as required by paragraph (f)(1)(iv) 
of this section, M has acted in a responsible manner as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section. M satisfies paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section because, under the facts, M can show that the failure was caused 
by B's failure to provide a correct TIN, an event beyond M's control. As 
a result, M has established reasonable cause under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section. Therefore, the penalty imposed under paragraph (a)(2) of 
Sec. 301.6721-1 for the failure on the 1991 information return is 
waived. See section 3406(a)(1)(B) which requires M to impose backup 
withholding on reportable payments to B if M has not received B's 
correct TIN.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The facts are the same as in Example 2. Under Sec. 35a.3406-
1(c)(1) of this paragraph and paragraph (f)(2) of this section, within 
15 days of the October 1992 notification of the incorrect TIN from the 
Internal Revenue Service, M solicits the correct TIN from B. B fails to 
respond. M timely files the return for

[[Page 381]]

1992 with respect to the account setting forth B's incorrect TIN. In 
October 1993 the Internal Revenue Service notifies M pursuant to section 
3406(a)(1)(B) that the 1992 return contains an incorrect TIN. In April 
1994, a penalty is imposed on M pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(2) of 
Sec. 301.6721-1T for M's failure to include B's correct TIN on the 
return for 1992. The penalty will be waived, if M establishes that the 
failure was due to reasonable cause as defined in this section.
    (iii) M must satisfy the reasonable cause criteria in paragraphs 
(c)(6) and (d) of this section. M may demonstrate that it acted in a 
responsible manner as required under paragraph (d) of this section only 
by complying with paragraph (f) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this 
section requires a filer to make an initial solicitation for a TIN when 
an account is opened. Further, a filer must make an annual solicitation 
for a TIN by mail within 15 business days after the date that the 
Internal Revenue Service notifies the filer of an incorrect TIN pursuant 
to section 3406(a)(1)(B). M made the initial solicitation for the TIN in 
1991 and, after being notified of the incorrect TIN in October 1992, the 
first annual solicitation within the time and manner prescribed by 
section 35a.3406-1(c)(1) of this chapter and paragraph (f) (1)(ii) and 
(2) of this section. M acted in a responsible manner. M satisfies 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section because, under the facts, M can show 
that the failure was caused by B's failure to provide his correct TIN, 
an event beyond M's control. As a result M has established reasonable 
cause under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Therefore, the penalty 
imposed under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1T for the failure on 
the 1992 return is waived due to reasonable cause.
    Example 4. (i) Table.

                                        1992 return.                                      1992 return.          
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The facts are the same as in Example 3. M timely solicits B's 
TIN in October 1993, which B fails to provide. M files the return for 
1993 with the incorrect TIN. In April 1995 the Internal Revenue Service 
informs M that the 1993 return contains an incorrect TIN. M does not 
solicit a TIN from B in 1994 and files a return for 1994 with B's 
incorrect TIN. M seeks a waiver of the penalty under paragraph (a)(2) of 
Sec. 301.6721-1 for reasonable cause. M must satisfy the reasonable 
cause criteria in paragraphs (c)(6) and (d) of this section. Because M 
made the initial and two annual solicitations as required by paragraph 
(f) of this section, M has demonstrated that it acted in a responsible 
manner and is not required to solicit B's TIN in 1994. See paragraph 
(f)(5)(iv) of this section. M satisfies paragraph (c)(6) of this section 
because, under the facts, M can show that the failure was caused by B's 
failure to provide his correct TIN, an event beyond M's control. 
Therefore, M has established reasonable cause under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    Example 5. In 1992, Mortgage Finance Company N lends money to C to 
purchase property in a transaction subject to reporting under section 
6050H and to section 6721. As part of the transaction, C gives N a 
promissory note providing for repayment of principal and the payment of 
interest. At the time C incurs the obligation N requests C's TIN, as 
required under Sec. 1.6050H-2(f) of this chapter. C fails to provide the 
TIN as required by Sec. 1.6050H-2(f) of this chapter. N sends 
solicitations by mail in 1992 and 1993 for the missing TIN, which C 
fails to provide. However, for 1994 M fails to send the solicitation 
required by Sec. 1.6050H-2(f) of this chapter. N files returns for the 
1992, 1993, and 1994 calendar years pursuant to section 6050H without 
C's TIN. Although N made the initial and the first annual solicitations 
in 1992 and the second annual solicitation in 1993, N did not solicit 
the TIN in 1994 as required under section 6050H, which requires 
continued annual solicitations until the TIN is obtained. Therefore, 
under paragraph (e)(1)(vi)(A) of this section the penalty imposed under 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6721-1T for the 1994 information return is not 
waived.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) On October 1, 1991, Individual E opens an account with 
Institution R, which pays E amounts reportable under section 6049. When 
E opens the account, R requests that E supply his TIN on an account 
creation document, which E does. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of 
this section, R uses the TIN furnished by E on the information return 
filed for the 1991 calendar year. In October 1992

[[Page 382]]

the Internal Revenue Service notifies R pursuant to section 
3406(a)(1)(B) that the information return filed for E for the 1991 
calendar year contained an incorrect TIN. At the time R receives this 
notification, E's account contains the incorrect TIN. On December 31, 
1992, R telephones E pursuant to paragraphs (f)(3) and (e)(2)(ii) of 
this section and receives different TIN information from E. R uses this 
information on the return that it files timely for E for the 1992 
calendar year, i.e., in February 1993.
    (iii) In April 1993, the Internal Revenue Service notifies R 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 that the information 
return filed for the 1991 calendar year contains an incorrect TIN. The 
penalty will be waived, however, if R establishes the failure was due to 
reasonable cause as defined in this section.
    (iv) To establish reasonable cause under this section, R must 
satisfy the criteria in both paragraphs (c)(6) and (d)(2) of this 
section. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, R can demonstrate 
that it acted in a responsible manner only if it complies with paragraph 
(f) of this section. R solicited E's TIN at the time the account was 
opened (initial solicitation). Under paragraphs (d)(2) and (f)(4) of 
this section, the initial solicitation relates to failures on returns 
filed for the year in which an account is opened (i.e., 1991) and for 
subsequent years until the calendar year in which the filer receivers a 
notification of an incorrect TIN pursuant to section 3406. Because E 
failed to provide the correct TIN upon request, the failure arose from 
events beyond R's control as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section. Therefore, the penalty with respect to the failure on the 1991 
calendar year information return is waived due to reasonable cause.
    Example (7). (i) The facts are the same as in Example 6. In April 
1994 the Internal Revenue Service notifies R pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 that the information return filed for the 1992 
calendar year for E contained an incorrect TIN.
    (ii) To establish reasonable cause for the failure under this 
section, R must satisfy the criteria in both paragraphs (c)(6) and 
(d)(2) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section R 
may establish that it acted in a responsible manner only by complying 
with paragraph (f) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of 
this section, R must make an annual solicitation after being notified of 
an incorrect TIN if the payee's account contains the incorrect TIN at 
the time of the notification. Paragraph (f)(2) of this section provides 
that if the filer is notified pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) the time 
and manner of making an annual solicitation is that required under 
Sec. 35a.3406-(c)(1) of this chapter. Section 35a.3406-1 (c)(1) of this 
chapter requires R to notify E by mail within 15 business days after the 
date of the notice from the Internal Revenue Service, which R failed to 
do. As a result, R has failed to act in a responsible manner with 
respect to the failure on the 1992 information return, and the penalty 
will not be waived due to reasonable cause.

    (l) [Reserved.]
    (m) Procedure for seeking a waiver. In seeking an administrative 
determination that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not 
willful neglect, the filer must submit a written statement to the 
district director or the director of the Internal Revenue Service Center 
where the returns, as defined in section 6724(d), are required to be 
filed. The statement must--
    (1) State the specific provision under which the waiver is being 
requested, i.e., paragraph (b) or under paragraph (c) (2) through (6),
    (2) Set forth all the facts alleged as the basis for reasonable 
cause,
    (3) Contain the signature of the person required to file the return, 
and
    (4) Contain a declaration that it is made under penalties of 
perjury. See Sec. 1.6061-1 of the Income Tax Regulations for the rules 
on the signing of returns.
    (n) Manner of payment. The penalty due under sections 6721 through 
6723 shall be paid upon notice and demand by Internal Revenue Service, 
and in the same manner as a tax liability is paid.

 Regulations Applicable to Information Returns and Payee Statements the 
Due Date for Which (Without Regard to Extensions) Is After December 31, 
                    1986, and Before January 1, 1990


<R05>
Sec. 301.6723-1A  Failure to include correct information.

    (a) General rule. If any person files an information return (as 
defined in section 6724(d)(1)) or furnishes a payee statement (as 
defined in section 6724(d)(2)) the due date for which, determined 
without regard to extensions, is after December 31, 1986, and before 
January 1, 1990, and such person fails to include all of the information 
required to be shown on such return or

[[Page 383]]

statement or includes incorrect information, such person will be 
considered to have failed to include correct information. For this 
purpose, information required to be shown on a return or statement is 
the information required by the applicable information reporting statute 
or by any administrative pronouncement issued thereunder (such as a 
regulation, revenue ruling, revenue procedure, or information reporting 
form). Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person who 
fails to include correct information shall pay $5 for each return or 
statement with respect to which such failure occurs; however, the total 
amount imposed on any person for all such failures during any calendar 
year shall not exceed $20,000. See paragraph (e) of this section 
regarding the higher penalties for intentional disregard of the correct 
information reporting requirement and for interest and dividend returns 
and statements.
    (b) Exception for inconsequential omissions and inaccuracies--(1) 
Exception. The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not 
be assessed for any failure to include correct information on an 
information return if the failure does not prevent or hinder the 
Internal Revenue Service from processing the return or from correlating 
the information required to be shown on the return with the information 
shown on the payee's tax return. Similarly, the penalty imposed by 
paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed for any failure to 
include correct information on a payee statement if the failure cannot 
reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely 
receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A payor files a form 1099-MISC (relating to miscellaneous 
income) with the Internal Revenue Service and furnishes a corresponding 
statement to the payee. Both the form 1099-MISC and the payee statement 
are complete and correct, except that the word ``Street'' is misspelled 
in the payee's address. The error does not prevent or hinder the 
Internal Revenue Service from processing the return or from correlating 
the information required to be shown on the return with the information 
shown on the payee's tax return. In addition, the error cannot 
reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely 
receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return. 
Therefore, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not 
be assessed.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the 
only error on the form 1099-MISC and the payee statement is that the 
payee's first name, ``William,'' is misspelled as ``Willaim.'' The 
penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed, 
for the reasons set forth in Example 1.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the 
only error on the form 1099-MISC and the payee statement is that the 
payee's street address, 4821 Main Street, is incorrectly reported as 
8421 Main Street. The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section 
will not be assessed with respect to the form 1099-MISC if the error 
does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from processing 
the return or from correlating the information required to be shown on 
the return with the information shown on the payee's tax return. 
However, the penalty will be assessed with respect to the payee 
statement because the error can reasonably be expected to prevent or 
hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting 
it on his or her tax return. See paragraph (d) of this section regarding 
waiver of the penalty for reasonable cause or due diligence.

    (c) Exception for corrected omissions and inaccuracies--(1) 
Exception. The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section 
generally will not be assessed for a failure to include correct 
information on an information return or payee statement if the person 
who filed the return or furnished the statement corrects the failure by 
the earliest of--
    (i) The date that is 30 days after the date that the person 
discovers the failure; or
    (ii) The date that is 30 days after the date of a written request, 
from the Internal Revenue Service to the person, for corrected 
information; or
    (iii) October 1 (March 1 for payee statements) of the calendar year 
in which the return or statement is due.
    (2) Limitations on exception. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, timely correction of a failure to include correct 
information on a return or statement will not prevent assessment of the 
penalty for any failure that is part of a pattern of conduct, by

[[Page 384]]

the person who filed the return or furnished the statement, of 
repeatedly failing to include correct information. Further, correction 
of a failure to include correct information will not prevent assessment 
of the penalty for intentional disregard of the correct information 
reporting requirement. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section with respect 
to intentional disregard.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. In January 1987, Bank M prepares forms 1099-INT (relating 
to interest income) with respect to interest income earned by its 
depositors in calendar year 1986. M timely files the forms with the 
Internal Revenue Service and timely furnishes copies to its depositors. 
On March 16, 1987, M discovers that the amount of backup withholding tax 
(Federal income tax withheld) was inadvertently omitted from several of 
the forms and payee copies. Several days later M files corrected forms 
with the Service and furnishes corrected copies to the affected payees. 
The penalty for failure to include correct information will not be due 
with respect to the incomplete forms 1099-INT filed with the Internal 
Revenue Service, since they were corrected within 30 days after M 
discovered the omission and before October 1, 1987. However, the penalty 
will be due with respect to the incomplete copies furnished to the 
payees, since they were not corrected by March 1, 1987.
    Example 2. In January 1987, Corporation N files forms 1099-DIV 
(relating to dividends and distributions) for calendar year 1986 and 
furnishes copies to its shareholders. A significant number of the forms 
and payee copies do not include the amount of backup withholding tax. On 
December 1, 1987, the Internal Revenue Service provides N with a written 
request for corrected information. On December 15, 1987, N files 
corrected forms with the Service and furnishes corrected copies to the 
payees. The penalty for failure to include correct information will be 
due with respect to the incomplete forms, since they were not corrected 
by October 1, 1987. In addition, the penalty will be due with respect to 
the incomplete copies furnished to the payees, since they were not 
corrected by March 1, 1987. However, N's correction of the forms is a 
fact to be considered, along with other facts, in determining whether 
the higher penalty for intentional failures will be imposed; see 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
    Example 3. In January 1987, Corporation O files forms 1099-DIV for 
calendar year 1986 and furnishes copies to its shareholders. O 
intentionally does not include the amount of backup withholding tax for 
any shareholder. Since the omissions represent an intentional disregard 
of the correct information reporting requirement, correction of the 
omissions will not prevent assessment of the penalty for intentional 
failure to include correct information.

    (d) Waiver for reasonable cause or due diligence--(1) Reasonable 
cause. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (relating 
to interest or dividend returns or statements), the penalty imposed by 
paragraph (a) of this section will be waived for any failure to include 
correct information if it is established to the satisfaction of the 
district director or the director of the internal revenue service center 
that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful 
neglect.
    (2) Due diligence. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section will not apply 
in the case of any interest or dividend return or statement (as defined 
in section 6724(c)(5). However, in such a case, the penalty imposed by 
paragraph (a) of this section will be waived for any failure to include 
correct information if it is established to the satisfaction of the 
district director or the director of the internal revenue service center 
that the person otherwise liable for such penalty exercised due 
diligence in attempting to include such information. The requirement to 
exercise due diligence imposes a higher standard of conduct than 
required under the reasonable cause defense.
    (3) Procedure for seeking waiver. Reasonable cause (or due 
diligence) may be established only by submitting a written statement 
that sets forth all the facts alleged as reasonable cause (or due 
diligence) and makes an affirmative showing of reasonable cause (or due 
diligence). The statement must be signed by the person required to file 
the information return or furnish the payee statement to which the 
penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section relates, and must 
contain a declaration that is is made under the penalties of perjury. 
See Sec. 301.6061-1 for rules on the signing of returns.
    (e) Higher penalties in certain cases--(1) Intentional disregard of 
the correct information reporting requirement--(i) Application of 
section 6723(b). If a person fails to include correct information on an 
information return and such failure

[[Page 385]]

is due to intentional disregard of the correct information reporting 
requirement, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to such return will be determined under section 6723(b). The 
penalty prescribed by section 6723(b) for such a return is $100 or, if 
greater, the amount equal to 10 percent (or, in some cases, 5 percent) 
of the aggregate amount of the items required to be reported correctly 
on the return. In the case of any penalty determined under section 
6723(b), the $20,000 limitation of paragraph (a) of this section will 
not apply. In addition, such penalty will not be taken into account in 
applying the $20,000 limitation to penalties not determined under 
section 6723(b).
    (ii) Meaning of intentional disregard. A failure to include correct 
information on an information return will be treated as due to 
intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement 
if the person who filed the return knowingly or willfully failed to 
include correct information at the time the return was filed. Whether a 
person knowingly or willfully failed to include correct information will 
be determined on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances in the 
particular case. Facts and circumstances to be considered for this 
purpose include, but are not limited to, the following--
    (A) Whether the failure to include correct information is part of a 
pattern of conduct, by the person who filed the return, of repeatedly 
failing to include correct information on information returns;
    (B) Whether the person who filed the return corrects the failure 
within 30 days after the date of any written request from the Internal 
Revenue Service for corrected information; and
    (C) Whether the person who filed the return can reasonably be 
expected to have discovered the failure during the calendar year the 
return was due and, if so, whether timely correction was made.
    (2) Interest and dividend returns and statements. In the case of any 
interest or dividend return or statement (as defined in section 
6724(c)(5)), the $20,000 limitation of paragraph (a) of this section 
will not apply. In addition, any penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of 
this section with respect to such a return or statement--
    (i) Will not be taken into account in applying the $20,000 
limitation of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to other 
returns or statements, and
    (ii) Will not be taken into account in applying the $100,000 
limitations of sections 6721(a) and 6722(a) with respect to any return 
or statement.
    (f) Manner of payment--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section (relating to interest and dividend 
returns and statements), any penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be paid on notice and demand by the Internal Revenue 
Service and in the same manner as a tax liability is paid.
    (2) Self-assessment for interest and dividend returns and 
statements. Any penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to an interest or dividend return or statement will be assessed 
and collected in the same manner as an excise tax imposed by subtitle D 
of the Internal Revenue Code, and the deficiency procedures of 
subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Code will not apply. In such a case, 
the penalty must be self-assessed and will be due and payable on April 1 
of the calendar year following the calendar year for which the return or 
statement is required. The penalty should be remitted with a properly 
executed Form 8210 (Self-Assessed Penalties Return).
    (g) Coordination with other penalties--(1) Penalty for failure to 
supply identifying numbers. Pursuant to section 6723(c), no penalty 
shall be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any 
return or statement if a penalty is imposed under section 6676 (relating 
to the failure to supply identifying numbers) with respect to such 
return or statement.
    (2) Penalty for failure to file information returns or furnish payee 
statements. No penalty shall be imposed under paragraph (a) of this 
section with respect to any return or statement if a penalty is imposed 
under section 6721 (relating to the failure to file certain information 
returns) or section 6722 (relating to the failure to furnish certain 
payee statements) with respect to such return or statement.

[[Page 386]]

    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (g) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation P timely files Forms 1099-DIV (relating to 
dividends and distributions) for a calendar year and furnishes copies to 
its shareholders. Several of these forms and shareholder copies do not 
include correct taxpayer identification numbers (TINs), and Corporation 
P does not show that it exercised due diligence in attempting to include 
correct TINs; therefore, a penalty is imposed under section 6676(b) with 
respect to these several forms and shareholder copies. Since a penalty 
is imposed under section 6676, no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) 
of this section with respect to the same several forms and shareholder 
copies.
    Example 2. Corporation Q, a bank, fails to file certain required 
Forms 1099-INT (relating to interest income of its depositors) in a 
timely fashion. Corporation Q claims that it exercised due diligence in 
attempting to file the forms on time and that therefore no penalty under 
section 6721 or 6723 should apply. If the Internal Revenue Service finds 
that Corporation Q did not exercise due diligence and imposes the 
failure-to-file penalty under section 6721 with respect to the forms, no 
penalty will be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.
    Example 3. Corporation R files with the Internal Revenue Service a 
document purporting to be an information return. The document contains 
so many omissions and inaccuracies that its utility as an information 
return is minimized or eliminated. The Service imposes the failure-to-
file penalty under section 6721 with respect to the document. Since the 
failure-to-file penalty is imposed, no penalty will be imposed under 
paragraph (a) of this section.

    (h) Effective date. The rules contained in this section are 
effective January 1, 1987, as applicable to information returns and 
payee statements the due date for which, determined without regard to 
extensions, is after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1990. See 
section 7711 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 
101-239, 103 Stat. 2106 (1989)) for the applicable penalty for certain 
failures related to information returns and payee statements the due 
date for which, without regard to extensions, is after December 31, 
1989.

                       termination of taxable year


<R05>
Sec. 301.6851-1   Termination of taxable year.

    For regulations under section 6851, see Secs. 1.6851-1 to 1.6851-3, 
inclusive, of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).


<R05>
Sec. 301.6852-1  Termination assessments of tax in the case of flagrant political expenditures of section 501(c)(3) organizations.

    (a) Authority for making. Any assessment under section 6852 as a 
result of a flagrant violation by a section 501(c)(3) organization of 
the prohibition against making political expenditures must be authorized 
by the District Director.
    (b) Determination of income tax. An organization shall be subject to 
an assessment of income tax under section 6852 only if the flagrant 
violation of the prohibition against making political expenditures 
results in revocation of the organization's tax exemption under section 
501(a) because it is not described in section 501(c)(3). An organization 
subject to such an assessment is not liable for income taxes for any 
period prior to the effective date of the revocation of the 
organization's tax exemption.
    (c) Payment. Where a District Director has made a determination of 
income tax under paragraph (b) of this section or of section 4955 excise 
tax, notwithstanding any other provision of law, any tax will become 
immediately due and payable. The taxpayer is required to pay the amount 
of the assessment within 10 days after the District Director sends the 
notice and demand for immediate payment regardless of the filing of an 
administrative appeal or of a court petition. Regardless of filing an 
administrative appeal or of petitioning a court, enforced collection 
action may proceed after the 10-day payment period unless the taxpayer 
posts the bond described in section 6863. For purposes of collection 
procedures such as section 6331 (regarding levy), assessments under the 
authority of paragraph (a) of this section do not constitute situations 
in which the collection of such tax is in jeopardy and, therefore, do 
not suspend normal collection procedures.
    (d) Effective date. This section is effective December 5, 1995.

[T.D. 8628, 60 FR 62212, Dec. 5, 1995]

                          Jeopardy Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 301.6861-1  Jeopardy assessments of income, estate, gift, and certain excise taxes.

    (a) Authority for making. If a district director or director of a 
service center believes that the assessment or collection of a 
deficiency in income, estate, gift, or chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax 
will be jeopardized by delay, then the director is required to assess 
such deficiency immediately, together with the interest, additional 
amounts, and additions to the tax provided by law. A district director 
will make an assessment under this section if collection is determined 
to be in jeopardy because at least one of the conditions described in 
Sec. 1.6851-1(a)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) (relating to termination 
assessments) exists. A jeopardy assessment may be made before or after 
the mailing of the notice of deficiency provided by section 6212. 
However, a jeopardy assessment for a taxable year under section 6861 
cannot be made after a decision of the Tax Court with respect to such 
taxable year has become final (see section 7481) or after the taxpayer 
has filed a petition for review of the decision of the Tax Court with 
respect to such taxable year. In the case of a deficiency determined by 
a decision of the Tax Court which has become final or with respect to 
which the taxpayer has filed a petition for review and has not filed a 
bond as provided in section 7485, assessment may be made in accordance 
with the provisions of section 6215, without regard to section 6861.
    (b) Amount of jeopardy assessment. If a notice of a deficiency is 
mailed to the taxpayer before it is discovered that delay would 
jeopardize the assessment or collection of the tax, a jeopardy 
assessment may be made in an amount greater or less than that included 
in the deficiency notice. If a deficiency is assessed on account of 
jeopardy after

[[Page 389]]

the decision of the Tax Court is rendered, the jeopardy assessment may 
be made only with respect to the deficiency determined by the Tax Court.
    (c) Jurisdiction of Tax Court. If the jeopardy assessment is made 
before the notice in respect of the tax to which the jeopardy assessment 
relates has been mailed pursuant to section 6212(a), the district 
director shall, within 60 days after the making of the assessment, send 
the taxpayer a notice of deficiency pursuant to such subsection. The 
taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of 
the amount of the deficiency within the time prescribed in section 
6213(a). If the petition of the taxpayer is filed with the Tax Court, 
either before or after the making of the jeopardy assessment, the 
Commissioner, through his counsel, is required to notify the Tax Court 
of such assessment or of any abatement thereof, and the Tax Court has 
jurisdiction to redetermine the amount of the deficiency, together with 
all other amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.
    (d) Payment and collection of jeopardy assessment. After a jeopardy 
assessment has been made, the district director is required to send 
notice and demand to the taxpayer for the amount of the jeopardy 
assessment. Regardless of whether the taxpayer has filed a petition with 
the Tax Court, he is required to make payment of the amount of such 
assessment (to the extent that it has not been abated) within 10 days 
after the sending of notice and demand by the district director, unless 
before the expiration of such 10-day period he files with the district 
director a bond as provided in section 6863. Section 6331 provides that, 
if the district director makes a finding that the collection of the tax 
is in jeopardy, he may make demand for immediate payment of the amount 
of the jeopardy assessment and, in such case, the taxpayer shall 
immediately pay such amount or shall immediately file the bond provided 
in section 6863. If a petition is not filed with the Tax Court within 
the period prescribed in section 6213(a), the district director will be 
so advised, and, if collection of the deficiency has been stayed by the 
timely filing of a bond as provided in section 6863, he should then give 
notice and make demand for payment of the amount assessed plus interest. 
After the Tax Court has rendered its decision and such decision has 
become final, the district director will be notified of the action 
taken. He will then send notice and demand for payment of the unpaid 
portion of the amount determined by the Tax Court, the collection of 
which has been stayed by the bond. If the amount of the jeopardy 
assessment is less than the amount determined by the Tax Court, the 
difference will be assessed and collected as part of the tax upon the 
issuance of a notice and demand therefor. If the amount of the jeopardy 
assessment is in excess of the amount determined by the Tax Court, the 
unpaid portion of such excess will be abated. If any part of the excess 
amount has been paid, it will be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as 
provided in section 6402, without the filing of claim therefor.
    (e) Abatement of excessive assessment. The district director or the 
director of the regional service center may, at any time before the 
decision of the Tax Court is rendered, abate a jeopardy assessment in 
whole or in part if the district director believes that such assessment 
is excessive in amount.
    (f) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. (1) The district director 
or the director of the regional service center may abate a jeopardy 
assessment in whole or in part, if it is shown to the satisfaction of 
the district director that jeopardy does not exist. An abatement may not 
be made under this paragraph after a decision of the Tax Court in 
respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed 
with such court, after the expiration of the period for filing such 
petition.
    (2) After abatement of a jeopardy assessment in whole or in part, a 
deficiency may be assessed and collected in the manner authorized by law 
as if the jeopardy assessment or part thereof so abated had not existed. 
If a notice of deficiency has been sent to the taxpayer before the 
abatement of the jeopardy assessment in whole or in part, whether such 
notice was sent before or after the making of the assessment,

[[Page 390]]

such abatement will not affect the validity of the notice or of any 
proceedings for redetermination based thereon. The period of limitation 
on the making of assessments and the beginning of levy or a proceeding 
in court for collection in respect of any deficiency shall be determined 
as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that 
the running of such period shall in any event be suspended for the 
period from the date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration of 
the tenth day after the date on which such jeopardy assessment is abated 
in whole or in part. The provisions of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. On March 18, 1958, 28 days before the last day of the 3-
year period of limitations on assessment, a jeopardy assessment is made 
in respect of a proposed deficiency. On May 2, 1958, before the mailing 
of the notice of deficiency provided by section 6861(b), this assessment 
is abated. By virtue of this subparagraph, the last day of the period of 
limitations for the making of an assessment is June 9, 1958, that is, 
the 38th day after the date of the abatement. If the notice of 
deficiency provided for in section 6861(b) has been sent before the 
abatement, the running of the period of limitations on assessment would 
have been suspended pursuant to the provisions of the section 6503(a).

    (3) See section 7429 with respect to requesting the district 
director to review the making of the jeopardy assessment.
    (g) Special rules for chapters 42 and 43 taxes. For purposes of 
paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of a deficiency with respect 
to any tax imposed by section 4941(a), 4942(a), 4943(a), 4944(a), 
4945(a), 4951(a), 4952(a), 4955(a), 4971(a) or 4975(a) shall include the 
amount of additional tax imposed by section 4941(b), 4942(b), 4943(b), 
4944(b), 4945(b), 4951(b), 4952(b), 4955(b), 4971(b) or 4975(b) for 
failure to correct the act (or failure to act) which gave rise to 
liability for the initial tax.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6862-1  Jeopardy assessment of taxes other than income, estate, gift, and certain excise taxes.

    (a) If the district director believes that the collection of any tax 
(other than income, estate, gift, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax) will be 
jeopardized by delay, the director shall, whether or not the time 
otherwise prescribed by law for filing the return or paying such tax has 
expired, immediately assess such tax, together with all interest, 
additional amounts and additions to the tax provided by law. A district 
director will make an assessment under this section if collection is 
determined to be in jeopardy because at least one of the conditions 
described in Sec. 1.6851-1(a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) (relating to 
termination assessments) exists. For example, assume that a taxpayer 
incurs on January 18, 1977, liability for tax imposed by section 4061, 
that the last day on which return and payment of such tax is required to 
be made is May 2, 1977, and that on January 18, 1977, the district 
director determines that collection of such tax would be jeopardized by 
delay. In such case, the district director shall immediately assess the 
tax.
    (b) The tax, interest, additional amounts, and additions to the tax 
will, upon assessment, become immediately due and payable, and the 
district director shall, without delay, issue a notice and demand for 
payment thereof in full. Upon failure or refusal to pay the amount 
demanded, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful without regard to 
the 10-day period provided in section 6331 (a). However, the collection 
of the whole or any part of the amount of the jeopardy assessment may be 
stayed by timely filing with the district director a bond as provided in 
section 6863.
    (c) See section 7429 with respect to requesting the district 
director to review the making of the jeopardy assessment.

[[Page 391]]


<R05>
Sec. 301.6863-1  Stay of collection of jeopardy assessments; bond to stay collection.

    (a) General rule. (1) The collection of an assessment under section 
6851, 6861, or 6862 (referred to as a ``jeopardy assessment'' for 
purposes of this section), or under section 6852 (referred to as a 
political assessment for purposes of this section) of any tax may be 
stayed by filing with the district director a bond on the form to be 
furnished by the district director upon request.
    (2) The bond may be filed--
    (i) At any time before the time collection by levy is authorized 
under section 6331(a), or
    (ii) After collection by levy is authorized and before levy is made 
on any property or rights to property, or
    (iii) In the discretion of the district director, after any such 
levy has been made and before the expiration of the period of 
limitations on collection.
    (3) The bond must be in an amount equal to the portion (including 
interest thereon to the date of payment as calculated by the district 
director) of the jeopardy assessment or political assessment collection 
of which is sought to be stayed. See section 7101 and Sec. 301.7101-1, 
relating to the form of bond and the sureties thereon. The bond shall be 
conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest 
thereon), the collection of which is stayed, at the time at which, but 
for the making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due.
    (4) Upon the filing of a bond in accordance with this section, the 
collection of so much of the assessment as is covered by the bond will 
be stayed. The taxpayer may at any time waive the stay of collection of 
the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond. If as a result 
of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, or if 
any portion of the jeopardy assessment or political assessment is abated 
by the district director, then the bond shall be at the request of the 
taxpayer be proportionately reduced.
    (b) Additional conditions applicable to income, estate, gift, and 
chapter 41, 42, 43 and 44 tax assessments. In the case of jeopardy 
assessment or political assessment of income, estate, gift, chapter 41, 
42, 43, or 44 tax, the bond must be conditioned upon the payment of so 
much of the amount included therein as is not abated by a decision of 
the Tax Court which has become final, together with the interest on such 
amount. If the Tax Court determines that the amount assessed is greater 
than the correct amount of the tax, the bond will be proportionately 
reduced at the request of the taxpayer after the Tax Court renders its 
decision. If the bond is given before the taxpayer has filed his 
petition with the Tax Court, it must contain a further condition that if 
a petition is not filed before the expiration of the period provided in 
section 6213(a) for the filing of such petition the amount stayed by the 
bond will be paid upon notice and demand at any time after the 
expiration of such period, together with interest thereon at the annual 
rate referred to in the regulations under section 6621 from the date of 
the jeopardy (or political assessment) notice and demand to the date of 
the notice and demand made after the expiration of the period for filing 
petition with the Tax Court.

Sec. 301.6863-2  Collection of jeopardy assessment; stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision.

    (a) General rule. In the case of an assessment under section 6851, 
6852, 6861, or 6862, any property seized for the collection of such 
assessment shall not (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section) be sold until the latest of the following occurs:
    (1) The period provided in section 7429(a)(2) to request the 
district director to review the action taken expires.
    (2) The period provided in section 7429(b)(1) to file an action in 
U.S. District Court expires if a request for a redetermination is made 
to the district director.
    (3) The U.S. District Court judgment in such action becomes final, 
if a civil action is begun in accordance with section 7429(b).

[[Page 392]]

    (4) In addition to the occurrences described in paragraphs (a), (1), 
(2), and (3) of this section, in the case of an assessment of income, 
estate, gift, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 excise taxes, until the latest 
of the following occurs:
    (i) The expiration of the period provided in section 6213(a) within 
which the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court; or
    (ii) The decision of the Tax Court becomes final, if a petition for 
redetermination is filed with the Tax Court (whether before or after the 
making of the assessment).

However, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, in the 
case of a termination assessment under section 6851, property seized may 
be sold after the due date (determined with extensions) of the 
taxpayer's return if the taxpayer does not file a return by such date. 
Furthermore, for the purposes of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, a 
petition will not operate as a further stay of the sale of the seized 
property unless the taxpayer files a bond as provided in section 7485.
    (b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section, any property seized may be sold--
    (1) If the taxpayer files with the district director a written 
consent to the sale, or
    (2) If the district director determines that the expenses of 
conservation and maintenance of the property will greatly reduce the net 
proceeds from the sale of such property, or
    (3) If the property is of a type to which section 6336 (relating to 
sale of perishable goods) is applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 301.6867-1  Presumptions where owner of large amount of cash is not identified.

    (a) General rule. For purposes of section 6851 (relating to 
termination assessments) and section 6861 (relating to jeopardy 
assessments), if cash in excess of $10,000 is found in the physical 
possession of an individual who does not claim either ownership of that 
cash or ownership by some other person whose identity the Commissioner 
can readily ascertain and who acknowledges ownership of that cash as of 
the date the cash was found, then, it shall be presumed that--
    (1) The cash represents gross income of an unknown single 
individual; and
    (2) That the collection of tax on that income will be jeopardized by 
delay.
    (b) Rules for assessment. The Commissioner may make an assessment 
pursuant to section 6851 or section 6861, as appropriate, using the 
rules for assessment specified in this paragraph. In the case of any 
assessment resulting from the application of paragraph (a) of this 
section--
    (1) The entire amount of cash is treated as taxable income for the 
taxable year in which the cash is found;
    (2) The income is treated as taxable at the highest rate of tax 
specified in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c), the possessor of the cash 
is treated (solely with respect to that cash) as the taxpayer for 
purposes of chapters 63 and 64 and section 7429(a)(1) of the Internal 
Revenue Code.
    (c) Effect of later substitution of true owner--(1) In general. If 
an assessment resulting from the application of paragraph (a) of this 
section is later abated and replaced by an assessment against the true 
owner of the cash, the later assessment is treated for purposes of all 
laws relating to lien, levy, and collection as relating back to the date 
of the original assessment. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any 
notice and review provided for by section 7429 and the notice of 
deficiency issued to the true owner relative to the later assessment are 
to be made within the prescribed time limits, using the actual date of 
the later assessment against the true owner.
    (2) Example. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. On June 5, 1994, A is found in possession of a bag, 
containing $200,000, which A claims he was holding for a friend whose 
name A cannot remember. Because A does not claim ownership of the cash 
and does not provide the name of the true owner so that the Commissioner 
can identify the true owner and have that person acknowledge ownership 
of the cash, it is presumed that the cash represents gross income of an 
individual for calendar year 1994, and that the

[[Page 393]]

collection of tax on that gross income will be jeopardized by delay. 
Accordingly, on June 17, 1994, a termination assessment under section 
6851 is made against A, in his capacity as possessor of the cash. On 
June 21, 1994, the written statement of information provided for by 
section 7429(a)(1) is given to A. No request for review under section 
7429(a)(2) is made by the true owner within 30 days after the day on 
which A was furnished the written statement provided for in section 
7429(a)(1). Subsequently, individual B comes to the Service and states 
that he is the owner of the cash. On September 2, 1994, the Service 
determines that B was the true owner of the cash on June 5, 1994. On 
September 9, 1994, the Service abates the termination assessment made 
against A solely as possessor of cash and, after determining that 
jeopardy exists, replaces it with a termination assessment under section 
6851 against B. The lien against B that arises under section 6321 is 
treated as arising on June 17, 1994. However, within 5 days after 
September 9, 1994, the Service must give B the written statement of 
information required by section 7429(a)(1) so that B can make a request 
for review under section 7429(a)(2). In addition, a notice of deficiency 
must be sent to B within 60 days after the later of the due date or the 
actual filing of B's tax return for 1994, as required by section 
6851(b).

    (d) Rights of possessor of cash--(1) Action permitted. Section 6867 
provides that the possessor of cash is treated as the taxpayer for 
purposes of chapter 63 (relating to assessment) and chapter 64 (relating 
to collection) of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the possessor 
of cash may file a petition with the United States Tax Court, within the 
applicable time limits, challenging the notice of deficiency issued to 
the possessor solely in that person's capacity as possessor of cash.
    (2) Actions not permitted. Section 6867 provides that the possessor 
of cash is treated as the taxpayer solely for purposes of section 
7429(a)(1), and is entitled to the written statement of information 
provided for by that section. The possessor of cash is not treated as 
the taxpayer for purposes of sections 7429(a)(2) and 7429(b), relating 
to administrative and judicial review of termination and jeopardy 
assessments, and may not maintain an action under section 7429 for such 
review. The possessor of cash is not treated as the taxpayer for 
purposes of section 7422, relating to civil actions for refund, or 
chapter 65 of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to abatements, 
credits, and refunds, and may not institute a suit for refund in 
district court after the deficiency has been collected.
    (e) Rights of true owner of cash--(1) Actions permitted. The true 
owner of cash may request administrative review under section 7429(a)(2) 
and may maintain a civil action under section 7429(b) for judicial 
review of an assessment under section 6851 or section 6861 made against 
the possessor solely in that person's capacity as possessor of cash. 
Such an action, however, must be preceded by a request for review under 
section 7429(a)(2) made by the true owner within 30 days after the day 
on which the possessor is furnished the written statement provided for 
in section 7429(a)(1). In addition, after the deficiency asserted 
against the possessor of cash has been levied upon, the true owner of 
cash may bring an action in federal district court to recover the cash, 
as provided in section 7426, relating to civil actions by persons other 
than taxpayers. See, however, section 6532(c), relating to the 9-month 
statute of limitations for suits under section 7426. In addition, the 
true owner of cash, with the permission of the court, may appear before 
the United States Tax Court in any proceeding that may be filed by the 
possessor of the cash challenging the notice of deficiency issued to the 
possessor solely in that person's capacity as possessor of the cash.
    (2) Actions not permitted. The true owner of cash may not file a 
petition with the United States Tax Court challenging the notice of 
deficiency issued to the possessor solely in that person's capacity as 
possessor of cash. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the true 
owner of cash may file a petition with the United States Tax Court 
challenging any notice of deficiency issued to the true owner following 
the abatement of the assessment made against the possessor of cash.
    (f) Definitions. For the purposes of this section and section 6867--
    (1) Cash. The term cash includes any cash equivalents.
    (2) Cash equivalent--(i) In general. The term cash equivalent 
includes foreign currency, any bearer obligation, and any medium of 
exchange that is of a type that has been frequently used in

[[Page 394]]

illegal activities, as listed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Specific cash equivalents. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i), 
the following are also cash equivalents--
    (A) Coins;
    (B) Precious metals;
    (C) Jewelry;
    (D) Precious stones;
    (E) Postage stamps;
    (F) Traveler's checks in any form;
    (G) Negotiable instruments (including personal checks, business 
checks, official bank checks, cashier's checks, notes, and money orders) 
that are either in bearer form, endorsed without restriction, made out 
to a fictitious payee, or otherwise in such form that title thereto 
passes upon delivery;
    (H) Incomplete instruments (including personal checks, business 
checks, official bank checks, cashier's checks, notes, and money orders) 
signed but with the payee's name omitted; and
    (I) Securities or stock in bearer form or otherwise in such form 
that title thereto passes upon delivery.
    (iii) Value of cash equivalents. A cash equivalent is taken into 
account at its fair market value except in the case of a bearer 
obligation, in which case it is taken into account at its face value.
    (3) Possessor of cash. An individual is considered to be the 
possessor of cash if the cash is found on that individual's person or in 
that individual's possession or is found in any object, container, 
vehicle, or area under that individual's custody or control.
    (4) True owner of the cash. The true owner of cash is the individual 
who beneficially owns the cash on the date such cash is found in the 
physical possession of the individual described in paragraph (f)(3) of 
this section. An agent, bailee, or other custodian of the cash is not 
the true owner of cash. A true owner of cash does not include an 
individual who, subsequent to the date on which the cash is found in the 
physical possession of the individual described in paragraph (f)(3) of 
this section, obtains ownership of the cash by purchase, subrogation, 
descent, or other means.
    (g) Effective date. This section is effective with respect to cash 
found in the physical possession of an individual on or after August 3, 
1995.

                      Bankruptcy and Receiverships


<R05>
Sec. 301.6871(a)-1   Immediate assessment of claims for income, estate, and gift taxes in bankruptcy and receivership proceedings.

    (a) Upon (1) the adjudication of bankruptcy of any taxpayer in any 
liquidating proceeding, (2) the filing with a court of competent 
jurisdiction or (where approval is required by the Bankruptcy Act, 11 
U.S.C. Chapters 1-14) the approval of a petition of, or the approval of 
a petition against, any taxpayer in any other proceeding under the 
Bankruptcy Act, or (3) the appointment of any receiver for any taxpayer 
in a receivership proceeding before any court of the United States or of 
any State or Territory or of the District of Columbia, the district 
director shall immediately assess any deficiency of income, estate, or 
gift tax (together with all interest, additional amounts, or additions 
to the tax provided by law), determined by him, if such deficiency has 
not heretofore been assessed in accordance with law. Such assessment 
shall be made immediately, whether or not a notice of deficiency has 
been issued, and without regard to the restrictions upon assessment 
under section 6213.
    (b) As used in this section and Secs. 301.6871(a)-2 to 301.6873-1, 
inclusive, the term ``proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act'' includes a 
proceeding under Chapters I to VII, inclusive, of the Bankruptcy Act, or 
under section 75 or 77 (11 U.S.C. 203, 205), or Chapters X to XIII, 
inclusive, of such Act, or any other proceeding under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6871(a)-2   Collection of assessed taxes in bankruptcy and receivership proceedings.

    (a) During a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. Chapters 
1-14) or a receivership proceeding in either a Federal or State court, 
generally the assets of the taxpayer are under the control of the court 
in which such proceeding is pending, and the collection of taxes cannot 
be made by levying upon such assets. However, any

[[Page 395]]

assets which under applicable provisions of law are not under the 
control of the court may be subject to levy. See paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 301.6871(b)-1 with respect to claims for such taxes. 
See section 6873 with respect to collection of unpaid claims.
    (b) District directors should, promptly after ascertaining the 
existence of any outstanding liability against a taxpayer in any 
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act or in any receivership proceeding, 
and in any event within the time limited by the appropriate provisions 
of the Bankruptcy Act, or by the appropriate orders of the court in 
which such proceeding is pending, file proof of claim covering such 
liability in the court in which such proceeding is pending. Such proof 
of claim should be filed whether the unpaid taxes involved have been 
assessed or not, except in cases where the instructions of the 
Commissioner direct otherwise; for example, where the payment of the 
taxes is secured by a sufficient bond. At the same time proof of claim 
is filed with the bankruptcy or receivership court, the district 
director will send notice and demand for payment to the taxpayer, 
together with a copy of such proof of claim.
    (c) Under sections 3466 and 3467 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 
191, 192) and section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 104), taxes 
are entitled to the priority over other claims therein specified, and 
the trustee, receiver, debtor in possession, or other person designated 
as in control of the assets of the debtor by the court in which the 
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act or receivership proceeding is 
pending, may be held personally liable for failure on his part to 
protect the priority of the Government respecting taxes of which he has 
notice. Sections 75(l), 77(e), 199, 337(2), 455, and 659(6) of the 
Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 203(l), 205(e), 599, 737(2), 855, and 1059(6)) 
also contain provisions with respect to the rights of the United States 
relative to priority of payment. For the filing of returns by a trustee 
in bankruptcy or by a receiver, see section 6012(b)(3) and 28 U.S.C. 
960. Bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act to 
determine all disputes regarding the amount and validity of taxes 
claimed in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act. A proceeding under the 
Bankruptcy Act or a receivership proceeding does not discharge any 
portion of a claim of the United States for taxes except in the case of 
a proceeding under section 77 or chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. 
However, the claim may be settled or compromised as in other cases in 
court.
    (d) For the requirement that a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or 
other like fiduciary give notice as to his qualification as such, see 
section 6036 and the regulations thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6871(b)-1   Claims for income, estate, and gift taxes in proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act and receivership proceedings; claim filed despite 
          pendency of Tax Court proceedings.

    (a) If it is determined that a deficiency is due in respect of 
income, estate, or gift tax and the taxpayer has filed a petition with 
the Tax Court before (1) the adjudication of bankruptcy in any 
liquidating proceeding, (2) the filing with a court of competent 
jurisdiction or (where approval is required by the Bankruptcy Act, 11 
U.S.C. Chapters 1-14) the approval of a petition of, or the approval of 
a petition against, any taxpayer in any other proceeding under the 
Bankruptcy Act, or (3) the appointment of a receiver, the trustee, 
receiver, debtor in possession, or other like fiduciary, may, upon his 
own motion, be made a party to the Tax Court proceeding and thereafter 
may prosecute the appeal before the Tax Court as to that particular 
determination. No petition shall be filed with the Tax Court for a 
redetermination of the deficiency after the adjudication of bankruptcy, 
the filing or (where approval is required by the Bankruptcy Act) the 
approval of a petition of, or the approval of a petition against, any 
taxpayer in any other bankruptcy proceeding, or the appointment of the 
receiver.
    (b) Even though the determination of a deficiency is pending before 
the Tax Court for redetermination, proof of claim for the amount of such 
deficiency may be filed with the court in which the proceeding under the 
Bankruptcy Act or receivership proceeding

[[Page 396]]

is pending without awaiting final decision of the Tax Court. In case of 
a final decision of the Tax Court before the payment or the disallowance 
of the claim in the proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act or receivership 
proceeding, a copy of the Tax Court's decision may be filed by the 
district director with the court in which such proceeding is pending.
    (c) While a district director is required by section 6871(a) and 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6871(a)-1 to make immediate assessment of any 
deficiency, such assessment is not made as a jeopardy assessment within 
the meaning of section 6861, and consequently the provisions of that 
section do not apply to any assessment made under section 6871. 
Therefore, the notice of deficiency provided in section 6861(b) will not 
be mailed. Although such notice will not be issued, a letter will be 
sent to the taxpayer or to the trustee, receiver, debtor in possession, 
or other like fiduciary, notifying him in detail how the deficiency was 
computed, that he may furnish evidence showing wherein the deficiency is 
incorrect, and that upon request he will be granted a conference by the 
district director with respect to such deficiency. However, such letter 
will not provide for such a conference where a petition was filed with 
the Tax Court before (1) the adjudication of bankruptcy in a liquidating 
proceeding, (2) the filing with a court of competent jurisdiction or 
(where approval is required by the Bankruptcy Act), the approval of a 
petition of, or the approval of a petition against, any taxpayer in any 
other proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, or (3) the appointment of a 
receiver.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6872-1   Suspension of running of period of limitations on assessment.

    If any fiduciary in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 
U.S.C. Chapters 1-14), including a trustee, receiver, or debtor in 
possession, or a receiver in any other court proceeding is required, 
pursuant to section 6036, to give notice in writing to the district 
director of his qualification as such, then the running of the period of 
limitations on assessment shall be suspended from the date the 
proceeding is instituted to the date such notice is received by the 
district director, and for an additional 30 days thereafter. However, 
the suspension under this section of the running of the period of 
limitation on assessment shall in no case exceed 2 years.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6873-1   Unpaid claims in bankruptcy or receivership proceedings.

    (a) If any portion of the claim allowed by the court in a 
receivership proceeding, or in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act 
(11 U.S.C. chs. 1-14) remains unpaid after the termination of such 
proceeding, the district director will send notice and demand for 
payment thereof to the taxpayer. Such unpaid portion with interest as 
provided in section 6601 may be collected from the taxpayer by levy or 
proceeding in court within the period of limitation for collection after 
assessment. For the general rule as to such period of limitation, see 
section 6502, and for suspension of the running of the period provided 
in section 6502, see, for example, section 6503. For suspensions under 
other provisions of law, see, for example, section 11f of the Bankruptcy 
Act (11 U.S.C. 29(f)). Extension of time for the payment of such unpaid 
amount may be granted in the same manner and subject to the same 
provisions and limitations as provided in section 6161(c).
    (b) Section 6873 is applicable only where a claim for taxes is 
allowed in a receivership proceeding or in a proceeding under the 
Bankruptcy Act. Claims for taxes, interest, additional amounts, or 
additions to the tax may be collectible in equity or under other 
provisions of law although no claim was allowed in the proceeding 
because, for example, such items were not included in a proof of claim 
filed in the proceeding or no proof of claim was filed. Except in the 
case of a proceeding under section 77 or chapter X of the Bankruptcy 
Act, a tax or a liability in respect thereof is not discharged by a 
proceeding under such act, whether or not a claim is filed in such 
proceeding, and provisions suspending the running of the period of 
limitation on the collection of taxes are applicable, whether or not a 
claim is filed in such proceeding.

Transferees and Fiduciaries--Table of Contents

<R05>



<R05>
Sec. 301.6901-1   Procedure in the case of transferred assets.

    (a) Method of collection--(1) Income, estate, and gift taxes. The 
amount for which a transferee of property of--
    (i) A taxpayer, in the case of a tax imposed by subtitle A of the 
Code (relating to income taxes),
    (ii) A decedent, in the case of the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 
of the Code, or
    (iii) A donor, in the case of the gift tax imposed by chapter 12 of 
the Code, is liable, at law or

in equity, and the amount of the personal liability of a fiduciary under 
section 3467 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (31 U.S.C. 192), in 
respect of the payment of such taxes, whether shown on the return of the 
taxpayer or determined as a deficiency in the tax, shall be assessed 
against such transferee or fiduciary and paid and collected in the same 
manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case 
of a deficiency in the tax with respect to which such liability is 
incurred, except as hereinafter provided.
    (2) Other taxes. The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee 
of property of any person liable in respect of any other tax, in any 
case where the liability of the transferee arises on the liquidation of 
a corporation or partnership, or a corporate reorganization within the 
meaning of section 368(a), shall be assessed against such transferee and 
paid and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions 
and limitations as in the case of the tax with respect to which such 
liability is incurred, except as hereinafter provided.
    (3) Applicable provisions. The provisions of the Code made 
applicable by section 6901(a) to the liability of a transferee or 
fiduciary referred to in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph 
(a), include the provisions relating to:
    (i) Delinquency in payment after notice and demand and the amount of 
interest attaching because of such delinquency;
    (ii) The authorization of distraint and proceedings in court for 
collection;
    (iii) The prohibition of claims and suits for refund; and
    (iv) In any instance in which the liability of a transferee or 
fiduciary is one referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), 
the filing of a petition with the Tax Court of the United States and the 
filing of a petition for review of the Tax Court's decision.

For detailed provisions relating to assessments, collections, and 
refunds, see chapters 63, 64, and 65 of the Code, respectively.
    (b) Definition of transferee. As used in this section, the term 
``transferee'' includes an heir, legatee, devisee, distributee of an 
estate of a deceased person, the shareholder of a dissolved corporation, 
the assignee or donee of an insolvent person, the successor of a 
corporation, a party to a reorganization as defined in section 368, and 
all other classes of distributees. Such term also includes, with respect 
to the gift tax, a donee (without regard to the solvency of the donor) 
and, with respect to the estate tax, any person who, under section 
6324(a)(2), is personally liable for any part of such tax.
    (c) Period of limitation on assessment. The period of limitation for 
assessment of the liability of a transferee or of a fiduciary is as 
follows:
    (1) Initial transferee. In the case of the liability of an initial 
transferee, one year after the expiration of the period of limitation 
for assessment against the taxpayer in the case of a tax imposed by 
subtitle A (relating to income taxes), the executor in the case of the 
estate tax imposed by chapter 11, or the donor in the case of the gift 
tax imposed by chapter 12, each of which for purposes of this section is 
referred to as the ``taxpayer'' (see subchapter A, chapter 66, of the 
Code).
    (2) Transferee of transferee. In the case of the liability of a 
transferee of a transferee, 1 year after the expiration of the period of 
limitation for assessment against the preceding transferee, or 3 years 
after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against 
the taxpayer, whichever of such periods first expires.
    (3) Court proceeding against taxpayer or last preceding transferee. 
If, before the

[[Page 398]]

expiration of the period specified in subparagraph (1) or subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph (c), (whichever is applicable), a court proceeding 
against the taxpayer or last preceding transferee for the collection of 
the tax or liability in respect thereof, respectively, has been begun 
within the period of limitation for the commencement of such proceeding, 
then within one year after the return of execution in such proceeding.
    (4) Fiduciary. In the case of the liability of a fiduciary, not 
later than 1 year after the liability arises or not later than the 
expiration of the period for collection of the tax in respect of which 
such liability arises, whichever is the later.
    (d) Extension by agreement--(1) Extension of time for assessment. 
The time prescribed by section 6901 for the assessment of the liability 
of a transferee or fiduciary may, prior to the expiration of such time, 
be extended for any period of time agreed upon in writing by the 
transferee or fiduciary and the district director or an assistant 
regional commissioner. The extension shall become effective when the 
agreement has been executed by both parties. The period agreed upon may 
be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the 
expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
    (2) Extension of times for credit or refund. (i) For the purposes of 
determining the period of limitation on credit or refund to the 
transferee or fiduciary of overpayments made by such transferee or 
fiduciary or overpayments made by the taxpayer to which such transferee 
or fiduciary may be legally entitled to credit or refund, an agreement 
and any extension thereof referred to in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph (d), shall be deemed an agreement and extension thereof for 
purposes of section 6511(c) (relating to limitations on credit or refund 
in case of extension of time by agreement).
    (ii) For the purpose of determining the limit specified in section 
6511(c)(2) on the amount of the credit or refund, if the agreement is 
executed after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment 
against the taxpayer with reference to whom the liability of such 
transferee or fiduciary arises, the periods specified in section 
6511(b)(2) shall be increased by the period from the date of such 
expiration to the date the agreement is executed. The application of 
this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. Assume that Corporation A files its income tax return on 
March 15, 1955, for the calendar year 1954, showing a liability of 
$100,000 which is paid with the return. The period within which an 
assessment may be made against Corporation A expires on March 15, 1958. 
Corporation B is a transferee of Corporation A. An agreement is executed 
on October 9, 1958, extending, beyond its normal expiration date of 
March 15, 1959, the period within which an assessment may be made 
against Corporation B. Under section 6511(c)(2) and section 
6511(b)(2)(A) the portion of an overpayment, paid before the execution 
of an agreement extending the period for assessment, may not be credited 
or refunded unless paid within three years prior to the date on which 
the agreement is executed. However, as applied to Corporation B such 3-
year period is increased under section 6901(d)(2) to include the period 
from March 15, 1958, to October 9, 1958, the date on which the agreement 
was executed.

    (e) Period of assessment against taxpayer. For the purpose of 
determining the period of limitation for assessment against a transferee 
or a fiduciary, if the taxpayer is deceased, or, in the case of a 
corporation, has terminated its existence, the period of limitation for 
assessment against the taxpayer shall be the period that would be in 
effect had the death or termination of existence not occurred.
    (f) Suspension of running of period of limitations. In the cases of 
the income, estate, and gift taxes, if a notice of liability of a 
transferee or the liability of a fiduciary has been mailed to such 
transferee or to such fiduciary under the provisions of section 6212, 
then the running of the statute of limitations shall be suspended for 
the period during which assessment is prohibited in respect of liability 
of the transferee or fiduciary (and in any event, if a proceeding in 
respect of the liability is placed on the docket of the Tax Court, until 
the decision of the Tax Court becomes final), and for 60 days 
thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6902-1   Burden of proof.

    In proceedings before the Tax Court the burden of proof shall be 
upon the

[[Page 399]]

Commissioner to show that a petitioner is liable as a transferee of 
property of a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for 
the tax.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6903-1   Notice of fiduciary relationship.

    (a) Rights and obligations of fiduciary. Every person acting for 
another person in a fiduciary capacity shall give notice thereof to the 
district director in writing. As soon as such notice is filed with the 
district director such fiduciary must, except as otherwise specifically 
provided, assume the powers, rights, duties, and privileges of the 
taxpayer with respect to the taxes imposed by the Code. If the person is 
acting as a fiduciary for a transferee or other person subject to the 
liability specified in section 6901, such fiduciary is required to 
assume the powers, rights, duties, and privileges of the transferee or 
other person under that section. The amount of the tax or liability is 
ordinarily not collectible from the personal estate of the fiduciary but 
is collectible from the estate of the taxpayer or from the estate of the 
transferee or other person subject to the liability specified in section 
6901.
    (b) Manner of notice. The notice shall be signed by the fiduciary, 
and shall be filed with the district director for the district where the 
return of the person for whom the fiduciary is acting is required to be 
filed. The notice must state the name and address of the person for whom 
the fiduciary is acting, and the nature of the liability of such person; 
that is, whether it is a liability for tax, and, if so, the type of tax, 
the year or years involved, or a liability at law or in equity of a 
transferee of property of a taxpayer, or a liability of a fiduciary 
under section 3467 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (31 U.S.C. 192) 
in respect of the payment of any tax from the estate of the taxpayer. 
Satisfactory evidence of the authority of the fiduciary to act for any 
other person in a fiduciary capacity must be filed with and made a part 
of the notice. If the fiduciary capacity exists by order of court, a 
certified copy of the order may be regarded as satisfactory evidence. 
When the fiduciary capacity has terminated, the fiduciary, in order to 
be relieved of any further duty or liability as such, must file with the 
district director with whom the notice of fiduciary relationship was 
filed written notice that the fiduciary capacity has terminated as to 
him, accompanied by satisfactory evidence of the termination of the 
fiduciary capacity. The notice of termination should state the name and 
address of the person, if any, who has been substituted as fiduciary. 
Any written notice disclosing a fiduciary relationship which has been 
filed with the Commissioner under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or 
any prior revenue law shall be considered as sufficient notice within 
the meaning of section 6903. Any satisfactory evidence of the authority 
of the fiduciary to act for another person already filed with the 
Commissioner or district director need not be resubmitted.
    (c) Where notice is not filed. If the notice of the fiduciary 
capacity described in paragraph (b) of this section is not filed with 
the district director before the sending of notice of a deficiency by 
registered mail or certified mail to the last known address of the 
taxpayer (see section 6212), or the last known address of the transferee 
or other person subject to liability (see section 6901(g)), no notice of 
the deficiency will be sent to the fiduciary. In such a case the sending 
of the notice to the last known address of the taxpayer, transferee, or 
other person, as the case may be will be a sufficient compliance with 
the requirements of the Code, even though such taxpayer, transferee, or 
other person is deceased, or is under a legal disability, or, in the 
case of a corporation, has terminated its existence. Under such 
circumstances, if no petition is filed with the Tax Court of the United 
States within 90 days after the mailing of the notice (or within 150 
days after mailing in the case of such a notice addressed to a person 
outside the States of the Union and the District of Columbia) to the 
taxpayer, transferee, or other person, the tax, or liability under 
section 6901, will be assessed immediately upon the expiration of such 
90-day or 150-day period, and demand for payment will be made. See 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6213-1 with respect to the expiration of such 
90-day or 150-day period.

[[Page 400]]

    (d) Definition of fiduciary. The term ``fiduciary'' is defined in 
section 7701(a)(6) to mean a guardian, trustee, executor, administrator, 
receiver, conservator, or any person acting in any fiduciary capacity 
for any person.
    (e) Applicability of other provisions. This section, relating to the 
provisions of section 6903, shall not be taken to abridge in any way the 
powers and duties of fiduciaries provided for in other sections of the 
Code.


<R05>
Sec. 301.6905-1   Discharge of executor from personal liability for decedent's income and gift taxes.

    (a) Discharge of liability. With respect to decedents dying after 
December 31, 1970, the executor of a decedent's estate may make written 
application to the applicable internal revenue officer with whom the 
estate tax return is required to be filed, as provided in Sec. 20.6091-1 
of this chapter, for a determination of the income or gift taxes imposed 
upon the decedent by subtitle A or by chapter 12 of the Code, and for a 
discharge of personal liability therefrom. If no estate tax return is 
required to be filed, then such application should be filed where the 
decedent's final income tax return is required to be filed. The 
application must be filed after the return with respect to such income 
or gift taxes is filed. Within 9 months (1 year with respect to the 
estate of a decedent dying before January 1, 1974) after receipt of the 
application, the executor shall be notified of the amount of the income 
or gift tax and, upon payment thereof, he will be discharged from 
personal liability for any deficiency in income or gift tax thereafter 
found to be due. If no such notification is received, the executor is 
discharged at the end of such 9 months (1 year with respect to the 
estate of a decedent dying before January 1, 1974) period from personal 
liability for any deficiency thereafter found to be due. The discharge 
of the executor under this section from personal liability applies only 
to him in his personal capacity and to his personal assets. The 
discharge is not applicable to his liability as executor to the extent 
of the assets of the estate in his possession or control. Further, the 
discharge does not operate as a release of any part of the property from 
the lien provided under section 6321 or the special lien provided under 
subsection (a) or (b) of section 6324.
    (b) Definition of ``executor''. For purposes of this section, the 
term ``executor'' means the executor or administrator of the decedent 
appointed, qualified, and acting within the United States.
    (c) Cross reference. For provisions concerning the discharge of the 
executor from personal liability for estate taxes imposed by chapter 11 
of the Code, see section 2204 and the regulations thereunder.

required of certain postmasters before June 6, 1972, and section 7485, 
relating to bonds to stay assessment and collection of a deficiency 
pending review of a Tax Court decision), or under any rules or 
regulations prescribed under the Code, shall (except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section) execute such bond--
    (1) On the appropriate form prescribed by the Internal Revenue 
Service (which may be obtained from the district director), and
    (2) With satisfactory surety.

For provisions as to what will be considered ``satisfactory surety'', 
see paragraph (b) of this section. The bonds referred to in this 
paragraph shall be drawn in favor of the United States.
    (b) Satisfactory surety--(1) Approved surety company or bonds or 
notes of the United States. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, a bond shall be considered executed with satisfactory surety 
if:
    (i) It is executed by a surety company holding a certificate of 
authority from the Secretary as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds; 
or
    (ii) It is secured by bonds or notes of the United States as 
provided in 6 U.S.C. 15 (see 31 CFR Part 225).
    (2) Other surety acceptable in discretion of district director. 
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Code, or the regulations 
thereunder, a bond may, in the discretion of the district director, be 
considered executed with satisfactory surety if, in lieu of being 
executed or secured as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(b), it is:
    (i) Executed by a corporate surety (other than a surety company) 
provided such corporate surety establishes that it is within its 
corporate powers to act as surety for another corporation or an

    (ii) Executed by two or more individual sureties, provided such 
individual sureties meet the conditions contained in subparagraph (3) of 
this paragraph (b);

    (i) He must reside within the State in which the principal place of 
business or legal residence of the primary obligor is located;
    (ii) He must have property subject to execution of a current market 
value, above all encumbrances, equal to at least the penalty of the

first securing the permission of the district director; and
    (v) He must file with the bond, and annually thereafter so long as 
the bond continues in effect, an affidavit as to the adequacy of his 
security, executed on the appropriate form furnished by the district 
director.

Partners may not act as sureties upon bonds of their partnership. 
Stockholders of a corporate principal may be accepted as sureties 
provided their qualifications as such are independent of their holdings

    (4) Adequacy of surety. No surety or security shall be accepted if 
it does not adequately protect the interest of the United States.
    (c) Bonds required by Internal Revenue Code of 1939. This section

<R05>
Sec. 301.7102-1   Single bond in lieu of multiple bonds.

    (a) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
a person who is required, or authorized, under the Code (other than 
sections 6803(a)(1) and 7485), or under any rules or regulations under 
the Code, to execute two or more bonds may, in the discretion of the 
district director, furnish a single bond in lieu of such two or more 
bonds but only if such single bond meets all the conditions and 
requirements prescribed for each of the separate bonds which it 
replaces. This section shall also apply in the case of bonds required or 
authorized under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (other than sections 
1423(b) and 1145) or under the regulations under such Code.
    (b) Bonds required under subtitle E and chapter 75 of the Internal

single bond will not be accepted in lieu of two or more bonds except as 
provided in the regulations in subchapter E of this chapter (Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Other Excise Taxes).


<R03>
Closing Agreements and Compromises--Table of Contents

<R05>



<R05>
Sec. 301.7121-1   Closing agreements.

    (a) In general. The Commissioner may enter into a written agreement 
with any person relating to the liability of such person (or of the 
person or estate for whom he acts) in respect of any internal revenue 
tax for any taxable period ending prior or subsequent to the date of 
such agreement. A closing agreement may be entered into in any case in 
which there appears to be an advantage in having the case permanently 
and conclusively closed, or if good and sufficient reasons are shown by 
the taxpayer for desiring a closing agreement and it is determined by 
the Commissioner that the United States

[[Page 403]]

will sustain no disadvantage through consummation of such an agreement.
    (b) Scope of closing agreement--(1) In general. A closing agreement 
may be executed even though under the agreement the taxpayer is not 
liable for any tax for the period to which the agreement relates. There 
may be a series of closing agreements relating to the tax liability for 
a single period.
    (2) Taxable periods ended prior to date of closing agreement. 
Closing agreements with respect to taxable periods ended prior to the 
date of the agreement may relate to the total tax liability of the 
taxpayer or to one or more separate items affecting the tax liability of 
the taxpayer, as, for example, the amount of gross income, deduction for 
losses, depreciation, depletion, the year in which an item of income is 
to be included in gross income, the year in which an item of loss is to 
be deducted, or the value of property on a specific date. A closing 
agreement may also be entered into for the purpose of allowing a 
deficiency dividend deduction under section 547. In addition, a closing 
agreement constitutes a determination as defined by section 1313.
    (3) Taxable periods ending subsequent to date of closing agreement. 
Closing agreements with respect to taxable periods ending subsequent to 
the date of the agreement may relate to one or more separate items 
affecting the tax liability of the taxpayer.
    (4) Illustration. The provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. A owns 500 shares of stock in the XYZ Corporation which he 
purchased prior to March 1, 1913. A is considering selling 200 shares of 
such stock but is uncertain as to the basis of the stock for the purpose 
of computing gain. Either prior or subsequent to the sale, a closing 
agreement may be entered into determining the market value of such stock 
as of March 1, 1913, which represents the basis for determining gain if 
it exceeds the adjusted basis otherwise determined as of such date. Not 
only may the closing agreement determine the basis for computing gain on 
the sale of the 200 shares of stock, but such an agreement may also 
determine the basis (unless or until the law is changed to require the 
use of some other factor to determine basis) of the remaining 300 shares 
of stock upon which gain will be computed in a subsequent sale.

    (c) Finality. A closing agreement which is approved within such time 
as may be stated in such agreement, or later agreed to, shall be final 
and conclusive, and, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance, or 
misrepresentation of a material fact:
    (1) The case shall not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon or 
the agreement modified by any officer, employee, or agent of the United 
States, and
    (2) In any suit, action, or proceeding, such agreement, or any 
determination, assessment, collection, payment, abatement, refund, or 
credit made in accordance therewith, shall not be annulled, modified, 
set aside, or disregarded.

However, a closing agreement with respect to a taxable period ending 
subsequent to the date of the agreement is subject to any change in, or 
modification of, the law enacted subsequent to the date of the agreement 
and made applicable to such taxable period, and each closing agreement 
shall so recite.
    (d) Procedure with respect to closing agreements--(1) Submission of 
request. A request for a closing agreement which relates to a prior 
taxable period may be submitted at any time before a case with respect 
to the tax liability involved is docketed in the Tax Court of the United 
States. All closing agreements shall be executed on forms prescribed by 
the Internal Revenue Service. The procedure with respect to requests for 
closing agreements shall be under such rules as may be prescribed from 
time to time by the Commissioner in accordance with the regulations 
under this section.
    (2) Collection, credit, or refund. Any tax or deficiency in tax 
determined pursuant to a closing agreement shall be assessed and 
collected, and any overpayment determined pursuant thereto shall be 
credited or refunded, in accordance with the applicable provisions of 
law.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7122-1   Compromises.

    (a) In general. Except with respect to certain criminal liabilities 
arising under the internal revenue laws relating to narcotics, smoking 
opium, and marihuana, the Commissioner may

[[Page 404]]

compromise any civil or criminal liability arising under the internal 
revenue laws prior to reference of a case involving such liability to 
the Department of Justice for prosecution or defense. Any such liability 
may be compromised only upon one or both of the following two grounds:
    (1) Doubt as to liability; or
    (2) Doubt as to collectibility.

No such liability will be compromised if the liability has been 
established by a valid judgment or is certain, and there is no doubt as 
to the ability of the Government to collect the amounts owing with 
respect to such liability.
    (b) Scope of compromise agreement. A compromise agreement may relate 
to a civil or criminal liability for taxes, interest, ad valorem 
penalties, or specific penalties. However, a criminal liability may be 
compromised only if it involves a violation of a regulatory provision of 
the Code, or a related statute, and then only if such violation was not 
deliberately committed with an intent to defraud.
    (c) Effect of compromise agreement. A compromise agreement relates 
to the entire liability of the taxpayer (including taxes, ad valorem 
penalties, and interest) with respect to which the offer in compromise 
is submitted and all questions of such liability are conclusively 
settled thereby. Specific penalties, however, shall be compromised 
separately and not in connection with taxes, interest, or ad valorem 
penalties. Neither the taxpayer nor the Government shall, upon 
acceptance of an offer in compromise, be permitted to reopen the case 
except by reason of (1) falsification or concealment of assets by the 
taxpayer, or (2) mutual mistake of a material fact sufficient to cause a 
contract to be reformed or set aside. However, acceptance of an offer in 
compromise of a civil liability does not remit a criminal liability, nor 
does acceptance of an offer in compromise of a criminal liability remit 
a civil liability.
    (d) Procedure with respect to offers in compromise--(1) Submission 
of offers. Offers in compromise shall be submitted on forms prescribed 
by the Internal Revenue Service which may be obtained from district 
directors of internal revenue, and should generally be accompanied by a 
remittance representing the amount of the compromise offer or a deposit 
if the offer provides for future installment payments. If the final 
payment on an accepted offer is contingent upon the immediate or 
simultaneous release of a tax lien in whole or in part, such payment 
must be in cash, or in the form of a certified, cashier's, or 
treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under 
the laws of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession of 
the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph 
money order.
    (2) Stay of collection. The submission of an offer in compromise 
shall not automatically operate to stay the collection of any tax 
liability. However, enforcement of collection may be deferred if the 
interests of the United States shall not be jeopardized thereby.
    (3) Acceptance. An offer in compromise shall be considered accepted 
only when the proponent thereof is so notified in writing. As a 
condition to accepting an offer in compromise, the taxpayer may be 
required to enter into any collateral agreement or to post any security 
which is deemed necessary for the protection of the interests of the 
United States.
    (4) Withdrawal or rejection. An offer in compromise may be withdrawn 
by the proponent at any time prior to its acceptance. In the event an 
offer is rejected, the proponent shall be promptly notified in writing. 
Frivolous offers or offers submitted for the purpose of delaying the 
collection of tax liabilities shall be immediately rejected. If an offer 
in compromise is withdrawn or rejected, the amount tendered with the 
offer, including all installments paid, shall be refunded without 
interest, unless the taxpayer has stated or agreed that the amount 
tendered may be applied to the liability with respect to which the offer 
was submitted.
    (e) Record. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, if an 
offer in compromise is accepted, there shall be placed on file the 
opinion of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service with 
respect to such compromise, with his reasons therefor, and including a 
statement of--
    (1) The amount of tax assessed,

[[Page 405]]

    (2) The amount of interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, 
or assessable penalty, imposed by law on the person against whom the tax 
is assessed, and
    (3) The amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the 
compromise.

However, no such opinion shall be required with respect to the 
compromise of any civil case in which the unpaid amount of tax assessed 
(including any interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or 
assessable penalty) is less than $500.
    (f) Requirement with respect to statute of limitations. No offer in 
compromise shall be accepted unless the taxpayer waives the running of 
the statutory period of limitations on both or either assessment or 
collection of the tax liability involved for the period during which the 
offer is pending, or the period during which any installment remains 
unpaid, and for one year thereafter.
    (g) Inspection with respect to accepted offers in compromise. For 
provisions relating to the inspection of returns and accepted offers in 
compromise, see section 6103(a) and the regulations thereunder contained 
in this part.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7216-1   Penalty for disclosure or use of tax return information.

    (a) In general. Section 7216(a) provides in effect that, except as 
provided in section 7216(b), any tax return preparer (as described in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) who on or after January 1, 1972, 
discloses or uses any tax return information (as described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section) other than for the specific purpose of 
preparing, assisting in preparing, or obtaining or providing services in 
connection with the preparation of, any tax return of the taxpayer by or 
for whom the information was made available to a tax return preparer, 
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be 
fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or

[[Page 406]]

both, together with the costs of prosecution. Pursuant to section 
7216(b), the provisions of section 7216(a) and this paragraph do not 
apply to any disclosure or use permitted under Sec. 301.7216-2 or 
Sec. 301.7216-3.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes only of section 7216 and 
Secs. 301.7216-1 through 301.7216-3--
    (1) Tax return. The term ``tax return'' means any return (or amended 
return) of the income tax imposed by chapter 1 or 2 of the Code, or any 
declaration (or amended declaration) of estimated tax made under section 
6015.
    (2) Tax return preparer. (i) The term tax return preparer means any 
person--
    (A) Who is engaged in the business of preparing tax returns,
    (B) Who is engaged in the business of providing auxiliary services 
in connection with the preparation of tax returns,
    (C) Who is remunerated for preparing, or assisting in preparing, a 
tax return for any other person, or
    (D) Any individual who, as part of his duties or employment with any 
person described in (A), (B), or (C) of this subdivision, performs 
services which assist in the preparation of, or assist in providing 
auxiliary services in connection with the preparation of, a tax return.

For example, assume that a bank is a tax return preparer within the 
meaning of (A) of this subdivision and it employs one individual to 
solicit the necessary tax return information for the preparation of a 
tax return and another individual to prepare the return on the basis of 
the information that is furnished. Under these circumstances, both 
employees are tax return preparers. Also, for example, a secretary to a 
tax return preparer who types or otherwise works on returns prepared by 
the preparer is a tax return preparer.
    (ii) A person is engaged in the business of preparing tax returns as 
described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph if, in the course 
of his business, he holds himself out to taxpayers as a person who 
prepares tax returns, whether or not tax return preparation is his sole 
business activity and whether or not he charges a fee for such services.
    (iii) A person is engaged in the business of providing auxiliary 
services in connection with the preparation of tax returns as described 
in subdivision (i)(B) of this subparagraph if, in the course of his 
business, he holds himself out to tax return preparers or to taxpayers 
as a person who performs such auxiliary services, whether or not 
providing such auxiliary services is his sole business activity and 
whether or not he charges a fee for such services. For example, a person 
part or all of whose business is to provide a computerized tax return 
processing service based on tax return information furnished by another 
person is a tax return preparer.
    (iv) A tax return preparer described in subdivision (i)(C) of this 
subparagraph includes any person who--
    (A) For remuneration but not in the course of a business prepares a 
tax return for another person, or
    (B) For remuneration and on a casual basis helps a relative, friend, 
or other acquaintance to prepare the latter's tax return.
    (v) A person is not a tax return preparer merely because he leases 
office space to a tax return preparer, furnishes credit to a taxpayer 
whose tax return is prepared by a tax return preparer, or otherwise 
performs some service which only incidentally relates to the preparation 
of tax returns. For example, assume that a tax return preparer contracts 
with a department store for the rental of space in the store, and that 
the store advertises that taxpayers who use the tax return preparation 
service may charge the cost of having their tax return prepared to their 
charge account with the department store. Under such circumstances, the 
department store is not a tax return preparer.
    (3) Tax return information. The term ``tax return information'' 
means any information, including but not limited to a taxpayer's name, 
address, or identifying number, which is furnished in any form or manner 
by a taxpayer for, or in connection with, the preparation of a tax 
return of such taxpayer. Information furnished by a taxpayer includes 
information which is furnished on behalf of the taxpayer by any person; 
for example, any person required

[[Page 407]]

under section 6012 to make a return for such taxpayer, such as a 
guardian for a minor, by a duly authorized agent for his principal, by a 
fiduciary for an estate or trust, or by a receiver, trustee in 
bankruptcy, or assignee for a corporation.

[T.D. 7310, 39 FR 11538, Mar. 29, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7216-2  Disclosure or use without formal consent of taxpayer.

    (a) Disclosure pursuant to other provisions of Internal Revenue 
Code. The provisions of section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 shall not 
apply to any disclosure of tax return information if such disclosure is 
made pursuant to any other provision of the Code or the regulations 
thereunder. Thus, for example, the provisions of such sections do not 
apply to a disclosure pursuant to section 7269 to an officer or employee 
of the Internal Revenue Service of information concerning the estate of 
a decedent or a disclosure pursuant to section 7602 to an officer or 
employee of the Internal Revenue Service of books, papers, records, or 
other data which may be relevant to the liability of any person for the 
income tax.
    (b) Disclosure or use of information in the case of related 
taxpayers. (1) A tax return preparer may use, in preparing a tax return 
of a second taxpayer, and may disclose to such second taxpayer in the 
form in which it appears on such return, any tax return information 
which the preparer obtained from a first taxpayer if--
    (i) The second taxpayer is related to the first taxpayer within the 
meaning of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a),
    (ii) The first taxpayer's tax interest in such information is not 
adverse to the second taxpayer's tax interest in such information, and
    (iii) The first taxpayer has not expressly prohibited such 
disclosure or use.
    (2) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (a), one 
taxpayer is related to another taxpayer if they have any one of the 
following relationships: husband and wife, child and parent, grandchild 
and grandparent, partner and partnership, trust or estate and 
beneficiary, trust or estate and fiduciary, corporation and shareholder, 
or members of a controlled group of corporations as defined in section 
1563.
    (3) See Sec. 301.7216-3(a)(3) for disclosure or use of tax return 
information of the taxpayer in preparing the tax return of a second 
taxpayer where the requirements of this paragraph are not satisfied.
    (c) Disclosure pursuant to an order of a court or a Federal or State 
agency. The provisions of section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 do not 
apply to any disclosure of tax return information if such disclosure is 
made pursuant to any one of the following documents:
    (1) The order of any court of record, Federal, State, or local, or
    (2) A subpoena issued by a grand jury, Federal or State, or
    (3) An administrative order, demand, summons or subpoena which is 
issued in the performance of its duties by--
    (i) Any Federal agency, or
    (ii) A State agency, body, or commission charged under the laws of 
the State or a political subdivision of the State with the licensing, 
registration, or regulation of tax return preparers. Information must be 
clearly identified in the document in order to be disclosed under this 
paragraph (c).
    (d) Disclosure for use in revenue investigations or court 
proceedings. A tax return preparer may disclose tax return information 
(1) to his attorney, or to an employee of the Internal Revenue Service, 
for use in connection with an investigation of such tax return preparer 
conducted by the Internal Revenue Service or (2) to his attorney, or to 
any officer of a court, for use in connection with proceedings involving 
such tax return preparer before the court, or before any grand jury 
which may be convened by the court.
    (e) Certain disclosure by attorneys and accountants. The provisions 
of section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 do not apply to any disclosure of 
tax return information permitted by this paragraph (e).
    (1) A tax return preparer who is lawfully engaged in the practice of 
law or accountancy and prepares a tax return for a taxpayer may use the 
tax return information of the taxpayer, or disclose such information to 
another employee or member of the preparer's law or accounting firm who 
may use it, to

[[Page 408]]

render other legal or accounting services to or for such taxpayer. Thus, 
for example, a lawyer who prepares a tax return for a taxpayer may use 
the tax return information of the taxpayer for, or in connection with, 
rendering legal services, such as estate planning or administration, or 
preparation of trial briefs or trust instruments, for the taxpayer or 
the estate of the taxpayer; or if another member of the same firm 
renders the other legal services for the taxpayer, the lawyer who 
prepared the tax return may disclose the tax return information to that 
other member for use in rendering those services for the taxpayer. In 
further illustration, an accountant who prepares a tax return for a 
taxpayer may use the tax return information, or disclose it to another 
member of the firm for use, for, or in connection with, the preparation 
of books of account, working papers, or accounting statements or reports 
to or for the taxpayer. Further, in the normal course of rendering such 
legal or accounting services to or for the taxpayer, the attorney or 
accountant may, with the express or implied consent of the taxpayer, 
make such tax return information available to third parties, such as 
stockholders, management, suppliers, or lenders.
    (2) A tax return preparer who is lawfully engaged in the practice of 
law or accountancy and prepares a tax return for a taxpayer may (i) take 
such tax return information into account, and may act upon it, in the 
course of performing legal or accounting services for a client other 
than the taxpayer or (ii) disclose such information to another employee 
or member of the preparer's law or accounting firm to enable that other 
employee or member to take the information into account, and act upon 
it, in the course of performing legal or accounting services for a 
client other than the taxpayer, when such information is or may be 
relevant to the subject matter of such legal or accounting services for 
the other client and its consideration by those performing the services 
is necessary for the proper performance by them of such services. In no 
event, however, may such tax return information be disclosed to a person 
who is not an employee or member of the law or accounting firm unless 
such disclosure is exempt from the application of section 7216(a) and 
Sec. 301.7216-1 by reason of another provision, other than this 
paragraph, of Sec. 301.7216-2 or Sec. 301.7216-3.
    (3) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A, a member of an accounting firm, renders an opinion on 
a financial statement of M Corporation that is part of a registration 
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the 
filing of such registration statement, but before its effective date, B, 
a member of the same accounting firm, prepares an income tax return for 
N Corporation. In the course of preparing such income tax return, B 
discovers that N does business with M and concludes that information he 
is given by N should be considered by A to determine whether the 
financial statement reported on by A contains an untrue statement of 
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to keep the 
statement from being misleading. B discloses to A the tax return 
information of N for this purpose. A determines that there is an 
omission of material fact and that an amended statement should be filed. 
A so advises M and the Securities and Exchange Commission. A explains 
that the omission was revealed as a result of confidential information 
which came to A's attention after the statement was filed, but A does 
not disclose the identity of the taxpayer or the tax return information 
itself. Section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 do not apply to the 
foregoing disclosure of N's tax return information by B to A and the use 
of such information by A in advising M and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission of the necessity for filing an amended statement. Section 
7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 would apply to a disclosure of N's tax 
return information to M or to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
unless such disclosure is exempt from the application of section 7216 
(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 by reason of another provision of either 
Sec. 301.7216-2 or Sec. 301.7216-3.
    Example 2. A, a member of an accounting firm, is conducting an audit 
of M Corporation, and B, a member of the same accounting firm, prepares 
an income tax return for D, an officer of M. In the course of preparing 
such return, B obtains information from D indicating that D, pursuant to 
an arrangement with a supplier doing business with M, has been receiving 
from the supplier, a percentage of the amounts which the supplier 
invoices to M. B discloses this information to A who, acting upon it, 
searches in the course of the audit for indications of such a kickback 
scheme. As a result, A discovers information from audit sources which 
also, but independently, indicates the existence of

[[Page 409]]

such a scheme. Without revealing the tax return information A has 
received from B, A brings to the attention of officers of M the audit 
information indicating the existence of the kickback scheme. Section 
7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 do not apply to the foregoing disclosure of 
D's tax return information by B to A, the use by A of such information 
in the course of the audit, and the disclosure by A to M of the audit 
information indicating the existence of the kickback scheme. See also 
Sec. 301.7216-2(j). Section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 would apply to a 
disclosure to M, or to any other person not an employee or member of the 
accounting firm, of D's tax return information furnished to B.

    (f) Corporate fiduciaries. A trust company, trust department of a 
bank, or other corporate fiduciary which prepares a tax return for a 
taxpayer to or for whom it renders fiduciary, investment, or other 
custodial or management services may (1) disclose or use the tax return 
information of such taxpayer in the ordinary course of rendering such 
services to or for the taxpayer or (2), with the express or implied 
consent of the taxpayer, make such information available to the 
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, or investment advisor.
    (g) Disclosure to taxpayer's fiduciary. If after furnishing tax 
return information to a tax return preparer the taxpayer dies or becomes 
incompetent, insolvent, or bankrupt, or his assets are placed in 
conservatorship or receivership, the tax return preparer may disclose 
such information to the duly appointed fiduciary of the taxpayer or his 
estate, or to the duly authorized agent of such fiduciary.
    (h) Disclosure by tax return preparer to tax return processor. A tax 
return preparer may disclose tax return information of a taxpayer to 
another tax return preparer described in Sec. 301.7216-1(b)(2)(i)(B) for 
the purpose of having the second tax return preparer transfer that 
information to, and compute the tax liability on, a tax return of such 
taxpayer by means of electronic, mechanical, or other form of tax return 
processing service.
    (i) Disclosure by one officer, employee, or member to another 
officer, employee, or member. An officer, employee, or member of a tax 
return preparer may transfer any tax return information to another 
officer, employee, or member of the same tax return preparer for the 
purpose of performing services which assist in the preparation of, or 
assist in providing auxiliary services in connection with the 
preparation of, the tax return of a taxpayer by or for whom the 
information was furnished.
    (j) Identical information obtained from other sources. The 
provisions of section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 shall not apply to the 
disclosure or use by a tax return preparer of information which is 
identical to any tax return information which has been furnished to him 
if such identical information was obtained otherwise than in connection 
with the preparation of, or providing auxiliary services in connection 
with the preparation of, a tax return.
    (k) Disclosure or use of information in preparation or audit of 
State returns. The provisions of section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 
shall not apply to the disclosure or use by any tax return preparer of 
any tax return information in the preparation or audit of, or in 
connection with the preparation or audit of, any tax return or 
declaration of estimated tax required of the taxpayer under the law of 
any State or political subdivision therefor, of the District of 
Columbia, or of any possession of the United States.
    (l) Retention of records. A tax return preparer may retain tax 
return information of a taxpayer, including copies of tax returns or 
data processing tapes prepared on the basis of such tax return 
information, and may use such information in connection with the 
preparation of other tax returns of the taxpayer or in connection with 
an audit by the Internal Revenue Service of any tax return. The 
provisions of paragraph (m) of this section respecting the transfer of a 
taxpayer list apply also to the transfer of any records and related 
workpapers to which this paragraph applies.
    (m) Lists for solicitation of tax return business. Any tax return 
preparer may compile and maintain a separate list containing the names 
and address of taxpayers whose tax returns he has prepared or processed. 
This list may be used by the compiler solely to contact the taxpayers on 
the list for the purpose of offering tax information or additional tax 
return preparation services to such taxpayers. The compiler of

[[Page 410]]

the list may not transfer the taxpayer list, or any part thereof, to any 
other person unless such transfer takes place in conjunction with the 
sale or other disposition of the tax return preparation business of such 
compiler. A person who acquires a taxpayer list, or a part thereof, in 
conjunction with such a sale or other disposition shall be subject to 
the provisions of this paragraph with respect to such list as if he had 
been the compiler of such list. The term ``list'', as used in this 
paragraph, includes any record or system whereby the names and addresses 
of taxpayers are retained.
    (n) Disclosure to report the commission of a crime. The provisions 
of section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 do not apply to the disclosure of 
any tax return information to the proper Federal, State or local 
official in order, and to the extent necessary, to inform the official 
of activities which may constitute, or may have constituted, a violation 
of any criminal law. In addition, such a disclosure made in the bona 
fide but mistaken belief that the activities constituted a violation of 
criminal law is not subject to section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1.
    (o) Disclosure or use of information for quality or peer reviews. 
The provisions of section 7216(a) and Sec. 301.7216-1 do not apply to 
any disclosure of tax return information permitted by this paragraph (o) 
made after December 28, 1990. Tax return information may be disclosed 
for the purpose of a quality or peer review to the extent necessary to 
accomplish the review. A quality or peer review is a review that is 
undertaken to evaluate, monitor, and improve the quality and accuracy of 
a tax return preparer's tax preparation, accounting or auditing 
services. A quality or peer review may be conducted only by attorneys, 
certified public accountants, enrolled agents, and enrolled actuaries 
who are eligible to practice before the Internal Review Service. See 
Department of the Treasury Circular 230, 31 CFR part 10. Disclosure of 
tax return information is also authorized to persons who provide 
administrative or support services to an individual who is conducting a 
quality or peer review under this paragraph (o), but only to the extent 
necessary for the reviewer to conduct the review. Tax return information 
gathered in conducting a review may be used only for purposes of a 
review. No tax return information identifying a taxpayer may be 
disclosed in any evaluative reports or recommendations that may be 
accessible to any person other than the reviewer or the preparer being 
reviewed. The preparer being reviewed shall maintain a record of the 
review including the information reviewed and the identity of the 
persons conducting the review. After completion of the review, no 
documents containing information that may identify any taxpayer by name 
or identification number may be retained by a reviewer or by the 
reviewer's administrative or support personnel. Any person (including 
administrative and support personnel) receiving tax return information 
in connection with a quality or peer review is a tax return preparer for 
purposes of sections 7216(a) and 6713(a).
    (p) Disclosure of tax return information due to a tax return 
preparer's incapacity or death. The provisions of section 7216(a) and 
Sec. 301.7216-1 do not apply to any disclosure of tax return information 
permitted by this paragraph (p) made after December 28, 1990. In the 
event of incapacity or death of a tax return preparer, disclosure of tax 
return information may be made for the purpose of assisting the tax 
return preparer or his legal representative (or the representative of a 
deceased preparer's estate) in operating the business. Any person 
receiving tax return information under the provisions of this paragraph 
(p) is a tax return preparer for purposes of sections 7216(a) and 
6713(a).

<R05>
Sec. 301.7216-3   Disclosure or use only with formal consent of taxpayer.

    (a) Written consent to use or disclosure--(1) Solicitation of other 
business. (i) If a tax return preparer has obtained from the taxpayer a 
consent described in paragraph (b) of this section, he may use the tax 
return information of such taxpayer to solicit from the taxpayer

[[Page 411]]

any additional current business, in matters not related to the Internal 
Revenue Service, which the tax return preparer provides and offers to 
the public. The request for such consent may not be made later than the 
time the taxpayer receives his completed tax return from the tax return 
preparer. If the request is not granted, no follow up request may be 
made. This authorization to use the tax return information of the 
taxpayer does not apply, however, for purposes of facilitating the 
solicitation of the taxpayer's use of any services or facilities 
furnished by a person other than the tax return preparer, unless such 
other person and the tax return preparer are members of the same 
affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504. Thus, for example, 
the authorization would not apply if the other person is a corporation 
which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same 
interests which own or control the tax return preparer but which is not 
affiliated with the tax return preparer within the meaning of section 
1504(a). Moreover, this authorization does not apply for purposes of 
facilitating the solicitation of additional business to be furnished at 
some indefinite time in the future, as, for example, the future sale of 
mutual fund shares or life insurance, or the furnishing of future credit 
card services. It is not necessary, however, that the additional 
business be furnished in the same locality in which the tax return 
information is furnished.
    (ii) For prohibition against solicitation of employment in matters 
related to the Internal Revenue Service, see 31 CFR 10.30 (Treasury 
Department Circular No. 230) and section 7 of Rev. Proc. 68-20, 1968-1 
C.B. 812.
    (2) Permissible disclosures to third parties. If a tax return 
preparer has obtained from a taxpayer a consent described in paragraph 
(b) of this section, he may disclose the tax return information of such 
taxpayer to such third persons as the taxpayer may direct. However, see 
Sec. 301.7216-2 for certain permissible disclosures without formal 
written consent.
    (3) Disclosure or use of information in connection with another 
person's return. A tax return preparer may disclose or use any tax 
return information, which was obtained from a first taxpayer, in 
preparing a tax return of a second taxpayer if the tax return preparer 
has obtained from the first taxpayer a written consent described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. See Sec. 301.7216-2(b) for disclosure or 
use in certain cases without formal consent.
    (b) Form of consent. A separate written consent, signed by the 
taxpayer or his duly authorized agent or fiduciary, must be obtained for 
each separate use or disclosure authorized in paragraph (a) (1), (2) or 
(3) of this section and shall contain--
    (1) The name of the tax return preparer,
    (2) The name of the taxpayer,
    (3) The purpose for which the consent is being furnished.
    (4) The date on which such consent is signed,
    (5) A statement that the tax return information may not be disclosed 
or used by the tax return preparer for any purpose (not otherwise 
permitted under Sec. 301.7216-2) other than that stated in the consent, 
and
    (6) A statement by the taxpayer, or his agent or fiduciary, that he 
consents to the disclosure or use of such information for the purpose 
described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b).
    (c) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. In order to stimulate the making of loans, a bank 
advertises that it is in the business of preparing tax returns. A 
taxpayer goes to the bank to have his tax return prepared. After the 
return has been completed by the bank, the employee of the bank who 
obtained the tax return information from the taxpayer explains that the 
taxpayer owes an additional $400 in taxes and that the bank's loan 
department may be able to offer the taxpayer a loan to pay the tax due. 
If the taxpayer decides to accept the opportunity offered to apply for a 
loan, the bank must first have the taxpayer execute a written consent 
described in paragraph (b) of this section for the bank to use any of 
such information which is required in determining whether to make the 
tax loan.
    Example 2. An individual who sells life insurance and shares in a 
mutual fund is also in the business of preparing tax returns. A taxpayer 
who has gone to the individual to have his tax return prepared is 
requested, at the time he picks up his completed tax return, to give his 
consent to the individual's

[[Page 412]]

use of his tax return information in connection with such individual's 
solicitation of the taxpayer's purchasing a life insurance policy and 
shares in the mutual fund. Before the individual may use such tax return 
information as a basis for soliciting such additional business from the 
taxpayer, the taxpayer must execute separate written consents under 
paragraph (b) of this section, one authorizing the use of such 
information as a basis for soliciting the sale of the mutual fund shares 
and a second authorizing the use of such information as a basis for 
soliciting the sale of the life insurance.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2 except that the 
individual does not sell life insurance but does sell shares in several 
mutual funds. If the request is for the purpose of using the tax return 
information as a basis for soliciting the sale at one time of shares in 
mutual funds A and B, only one written consent under paragraph (b) of 
this section is required of the taxpayer. If, however, the request is 
for the purpose of using the tax return information as a basis for 
soliciting the sale of shares in fund A at one time, and the sale of 
shares in fund B at a later time, two written consents under such 
paragraph are required of the taxpayer.

                   Civil Actions by the United States


<R05>
Sec. 301.7401-1   Authorization.

    (a) In general. No civil action for the collection or recovery of 
taxes, or of any fine, penalty, or forfeiture, shall be commenced unless 
the Commissioner (or the Director, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
Division, with respect to the provisions of subtitle E of the Code), or 
the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service or his delegate 
authorizes or sanctions the proceedings and the Attorney General or his 
delegate directs that the action be commenced.
    (b) Property held by banks. The Commissioner shall not authorize or 
sanction any civil action for the collection or recovery of taxes, or of 
any fine, penalty, or forfeiture, from any deposits held in a foreign 
office of a bank engaged in the banking business in the United States or 
a possession of the United States unless the Commissioner believes--
    (1) That the taxpayer is within the jurisdiction of a U.S. court at 
the time the civil action is authorized or sanctioned and that the bank 
is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the 
taxpayer in an office of the bank outside the United States or a 
possession of the United States; or
    (2) That the taxpayer is not within the jurisdiction of a U.S. court 
at the time the civil action is authorized or sanctioned, that the bank 
is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the 
taxpayer in an office outside the United States or a possession of the 
United States, and that such deposits consist, in whole or in part, of 
funds transferred from the United States or a possession of the United 
States in order to hinder or

[[Page 414]]

delay the collection of a tax imposed by the Code.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``possession of the United 
States'' includes Guam, the Midway Islands, the Panama Canal Zone, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and 
Wake Island.

[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7188, 37 FR 12796, June 
29, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7403-1   Action to enforce lien or to subject property to payment of tax.

    (a) Civil actions. In any case where there has been a refusal or 
neglect to pay any tax, or to discharge any liability in respect 
thereof, whether or not levy has been made, the Attorney General or his 
delegate, at the request of the Commissioner (or the Director, Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, or the Chief Counsel for the Bureau, 
with respect to the provisions of subtitle E of the Code), or the Chief 
Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service or his delegate, may direct a 
civil action to be filed in a district court of the United States to 
enforce the lien of the United States under the Code with respect to 
such tax or liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of 
the delinquent, or in which he has any right, title or interest, to the 
payment of such tax or liability. In any such proceeding, at the 
instance of the United States, the court may appoint a receiver to 
enforce the lien, or, upon certification by the Commissioner or the 
Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service during the pendency of 
such proceedings that it is in the public interest, may appoint a 
receiver with all the powers of a receiver in equity.
    (b) Bid by the United States. If property is sold to satisfy a first 
lien held by the United States, the United States may bid at the sale a 
sum which does not exceed the amount of its lien and the expenses of the 
sale. See also 31 U.S.C. 195.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7404-1   Authority to bring civil action for estate taxes.

    (a) If the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 of the Code is not paid 
on or before the last date prescribed for payment, the district director 
shall proceed to collect the tax under the provisions of general law; or 
appropriate proceedings in the name of the United States may be 
commenced in any court having jurisdiction to subject the property of 
the decedent to be sold under the judgment or decree of the court.
    (b) The remedy by action provided in section 7404 is not exclusive. 
The district director may proceed to collect the tax by levy, as 
provided in section 6331, on any or all property or rights to property 
of the estate, or collection may be enforced by an appropriate action 
against the executor, certain transferees, trustees, and beneficiaries 
for their personal liability. See Sec. 20.2002-1 of this chapter (Estate 
Tax Regulations).


<R05>
Sec. 301.7406-1   Disposition of judgments and moneys recovered.

    All judgments and moneys recovered or received for taxes, costs, 
forfeitures, and penalties shall be paid to the district director as 
collections of internal revenue taxes.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7409-1  Action to enjoin flagrant political expenditures of section 501(c)(3) organizations.

    (a) Letter to organization. When the Assistant Commissioner 
(Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) concludes that a section 
501(c)(3) organization has engaged in flagrant political intervention 
and is likely to continue to engage in political intervention that 
involves political expenditures, the Assistant Commissioner (Employee 
Plans and Exempt Organizations) shall send a letter to the organization 
providing it with the facts based on which the Service believes that the 
organization has been engaging in flagrant political intervention and is 
likely to continue to engage in political intervention that involves 
political expenditures. The organization will have 10 calendar days 
after the letter is sent to respond by establishing that it will 
immediately

[[Page 415]]

cease engaging in political intervention, or by providing the Service 
with sufficient information to refute the Service's evidence that it has 
been engaged in flagrant political intervention. The Internal Revenue 
Service will not proceed to seek an injunction under section 7409 until 
after the close of this 10-day response period.
    (b) Determination by Commissioner. If the organization does not 
respond within 10 calendar days to the letter under paragraph (a) of 
this section in a manner sufficient to dissuade the Assistant 
Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) of the need for 
an injunction, the file will be forwarded to the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue will personally 
determine whether to forward to the Department of Justice a 
recommendation that it immediately bring an action to enjoin the 
organization from making further political expenditures. The 
Commissioner may also recommend that the court action include any other 
action that is appropriate in ensuring that the assets of the section 
501(c)(3) organization are preserved for section 501(c)(3) purposes. The 
authority of the Commissioner to make the determinations described in 
this paragraph may not be delegated to any other persons.
    (c) Flagrant political intervention. For purposes of this section, 
flagrant political intervention is defined as participation in, or 
intervention in (including the publication and distribution of 
statements), any political campaign by a section 501(c)(3) organization 
on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office in 
violation of the prohibition on such participation or intervention in 
section 501(c)(3) and the regulations thereunder if the participation or 
intervention is flagrant.
    (d) Effective date. This section is effective December 5, 1995.

    (5) If a decision is entered upon a rehearing or if a decision is 
modified or reversed as the result of a decision of a higher court, upon 
the expiration, with respect to the decision on rehearing or the 
modified or reversed decision, of periods similar to those provided in 
subparagraphs (1) through (4).
    (b) Right to bring action. With respect to any taxable event, 
payment of the full amount of first tier tax for the taxable period 
shall constitute sufficient payment in order to maintain an action under 
this section with respect to the second tier tax.
    (c) Limitation on suit for refund. No suit may be maintained under 
this section for the credit or refund of any tax imposed under section 
4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, 4945, 4951, 4952, 4955, 4971, or 4975 with

supplemental proceeding (if any) under section 4961 (b), with respect to 
any taxable event, shall constitute a suit to determine all questions 
with respect to any other tax imposed with respect to such taxable event 
under such sections. Consequently, failure by the parties to the suit to 
bring before the Court any question described in the preceding sentence 
shall constitute a bar to the question.

Sec. 301.7423-1   Repayments to officers or employees.

    The Commissioner is authorized to repay to any officer or employee 
of the United States the full amount of such sums of money as may be

United States may intervene in such action or suit to assert any lien 
arising under title 26 of the United States Code on the property which 
is the subject of such action or suit. The provisions of section 2410 of 
title 28 of the United States Code (except subsection (b)) and of 
section 1444 of title 28 of the United States Code shall apply in any 
case in which the United States intervenes as if the United States had 
originally been named a defendant in such action or suit. If the 
application of the United States to intervene is denied, the 
adjudication in such civil action or suit shall have no effect upon such 
lien.

[T.D. 7305, 39 FR 9951, Mar. 15, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7425-1  Discharge of liens; scope and application; judicial proceedings.

    (a) In general. A tax lien of the United States, or a title derived 
from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States, may be 
discharged or divested under local law only in the manner prescribed in 
section 2410 of Title 28 of the United States Code or in the manner 
prescribed in section 7425 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 7425 
(a) contains provisions relating to the discharge of a lien when the 
United States is not joined as a party in the judicial proceedings 
described in subsection (a) of section 2410 of Title 28 of the United 
States Code. These judicial proceedings are plenary in nature and 
proceed on formal pleadings. Section 7425(b) contains provisions 
relating to the discharge of a lien or a title derived from the 
enforcement of a lien in the event of a nonjudicial sale with respect to 
the property involved. Section 7425 (c) contains special rules relating 
to the notice of sale requirements contained in section 7425(b). Section 
301.7425-2 contains rules with respect to the nonjudicial sales 
described in section 7425(b). Paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.7425-3 contains 
rules with respect to the notice of sale provisions of section 
7425(c)(1). Paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7425-3 contains rules relating to 
the consent to sale provisions of section 7425(c)(2). Paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 301.7425-3 contains rules relating to the sale of perishable goods 
provisions of section 7425(c)(3). Paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.7425-3 
contains the requirements with respect to the contents of a notice of 
sale. Section 301.7425-4 prescribes rules with respect to the redemption 
of real property by the United States.
    (b) Effective date. The provisions of section 7425, as added by the 
Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, are effective with respect to sales 
described in section 7425 occurring after November 2, 1966. The notice 
of sale provisions of section 7425 (c) (1) or (3) do not apply to sales 
occurring after Nobember 2, 1966, if the seller of the property 
performed an act before November 3, 1966, which act at

[[Page 417]]

the time of performance was required and effective under local law with 
respect to the sale. An example of such an act is publication of a 
notice of the sale in a local newspaper before November 3, 1966, if 
local law requires such publication before a sale and the publication is 
effective under local law. Accordingly, in such a case, it is not 
necessary to notify the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the 
provisions of section 7425 (c) (1) or (3). With respect to a notice of 
sale required under section 7425 (c) (1) or (3)--
    (1) Any notice of sale given to an office of the Internal Revenue 
Service or the Treasury Department during the period November 3, 1966, 
through December 21, 1966, shall be considered as adequate;
    (2) Any notice of sale given during the period December 22, 1966, 
through January 31, 1968, which complies with the provisions of either--
    (i) Revenue Procedure 67-25, 1967-1 C.B. 626 (based on Technical 
Information Release 873, dated December 22, 1966), or
    (ii) Section 301.7425-3, shall be considered as adequate; and
    (3) Any notice of sale given after January 31, 1968, which complies 
with the provisions of Sec. 301.7425-3 shall be considered as adequate.
    (c) Judicial proceedings--(1) In general. Section 7425 (a) provides 
rules, where the United States is not joined as a party, to determine 
the effect of a judgment in any civil action or suit described in 
subsection (a) of section 2410 of title 28 of the United States Code 
(relating to joinder of the United States in certain proceedings), or a 
judicial sale pursuant to such a judgment, with respect to property on 
which the United States has or claims a lien under the provisions of 
this title. If the United States is improperly named as a party to a 
judicial proceeding, the effect is the same as if the United States were 
not joined.
    (2) Notice of lien filed when the proceeding is commenced. Where the 
United States is not properly joined as a party in the court proceeding 
and a notice of lien has been filed in accordance with section 6323 (f) 
or (g) in the place provided by law for such filing at the time the 
action or suit is commenced, a judgment or judicial sale pursuant to 
such a judgment shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien 
of the United States.
    (3) Notice of lien not filed when the proceeding is commenced--(i) 
General rule. Where the United States is not joined as a party in the 
court proceeding and either a notice of lien has not been filed in 
accordance with section 6323 (f) or (g) in the place provided by law for 
such filing at the time the action or suit is commenced, or the law 
makes no provision for that filing, a judgment or judicial sale pursuant 
to such a judgment shall have the same effect with respect to the 
discharge or divestment of the lien of the United States as may be 
provided with respect to these matters by the local law of the place 
where the property is situated.
    (ii) Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (3) may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, the first mortgagee of an apartment building located 
in State Y, commenced a foreclosure action on the mortgage prior to the 
time that a notice of a Federal tax lien, on that building, had been 
filed. Under the law of Y, junior liens on real property are discharged 
by a judicial sale pursuant to a judgment in a foreclosure action. 
Therefore, the Federal tax lien on the building will be discharged by 
the judicial sale. This result is the same whether the tax lien arose 
before or after the date of commencement of the foreclosure action and 
whether notice of the tax lien was filed at any time after commencement 
of the foreclosure action.
    Example 2. On January 10, 1969, B dies testate and devises Blackacre 
to C. At B's death, Blackacre is subject to a first mortgage held by D. 
Realty is subject to administration as part of a decedent's estate under 
the laws of State X. However, C takes possession of Blackacre with the 
assent of E, the executor of B's estate. On January 5, 1970, D commences 
a foreclosure action on the mortgage. Under the law of X, junior liens 
on real property are discharged by a judicial sale pursuant to a 
judgment in a foreclosure action. After commencement of the proceedings, 
an assesssment for estate taxes is made and, thereafter, a notice of 
lien is filed in accordance with section 6323. The special lien on 
Blackacre, arising at the date of B's death, for estate taxes under 
section 6324(a) will be discharged by the judicial sale because there 
are no provisions for filing a notice thereof under law and junior liens 
are discharged by the sale under local law. The lien is discharged even 
though the executor

[[Page 418]]

failed to obtain a discharge of his personal liability under section 
2204. Furthermore, the general lien on Blackacre under section 6321 will 
be discharged by the judicial sale because the foreclosure action was 
commenced prior to the time that a notice of lien was filed.

    (4) Proceeds of a judicial sale. If a judicial sale of property 
pursuant to a judgment in any civil action or suit to which the United 
States is not a party discharges a lien of the United States arising 
under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the United 
States may claim the proceeds of the sale (exclusive of costs) prior to 
the time that distribution of the proceeds is ordered. The claim of the 
United States in such a case is treated as having the same priority with 
respect to the proceeds as the lien had with respect to the property 
which was discharged from the lien by the judicial sale.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7425-2  Discharge of liens; nonjudicial sales.

    (a) In general. Section 7425(b) contains provisions with respect to 
the effect on the interest of the United States in property in which the 
United States has or claims a lien, or a title derived from the 
enforcement of a lien, of a sale made pursuant to--
    (1) An instrument creating a lien on the property sold,
    (2) A confession of judgment on the obligation secured by an 
instrument creating a lien on the property sold, or
    (3) A statutory lien on the property sold.

For purposes of this section, such a sale is referred to as a 
``nonjudicial sale.'' The term ``nonjudicial sale'' includes, but is not 
limited to, the divestment of the taxpayer's interest in property which 
occurs by operation of law, by public or private sale, by forfeiture, or 
by termination under provisions contained in a contract for a deed or a 
conditional sales contract. Under section 7425(b)(1), if a notice of 
lien is filed in accordance with section 6323 (f) or (g), or the title 
derived from the enforcement of a lien is recorded as provided by local 
law, more than 30 days before the date of sale, and the appropriate 
district director is not given notice of the sale (in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 301.7425-3), the sale shall be made subject to and 
without disturbing the lien or title of the United States. Under section 
7425(b)(2)(C), in any case in which notice of the sale is given to the 
district director not less than 25 days prior to the date of sale (in 
the manner prescribed in section 7425(c)(1)), the sale shall have the 
same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of the lien or 
title as may be provided by local law with respect to other junior liens 
or other titles derived from the enforcement of junior liens. A 
nonjudicial sale pursuant to a lien which is junior to a tax lien does 
not divest the tax lien, even though notice of the nonjudicial sale is 
given to the appropriate district director. However, under the 
provisions of section 6325(b) and Sec. 301.6325-1, a district director 
may discharge the property from a tax lien, including a tax lien which 
is senior to another lien upon the property.
    (b) Date of sale. In the case of a nonjudicial sale subject to the 
provisions of section 7425(b), in order to compute any period of time 
determined with reference to the date of sale, the date of sale shall be 
determined in accordance with the following rules:
    (1) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting 
directly from a public sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date 
the public sale is held, regardless of the date under local law on which 
junior liens on the property are divested or the title to the property 
is transferred,
    (2) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting 
directly from a private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date 
title to the property is transferred, regardless of the date junior 
liens on the property are divested under local law, and
    (3) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property not 
resulting directly from a public or private sale, the date of sale is 
deemed to be the date on which junior liens on the property are divested 
under local law.

For provisions relating to the right of redemption of the United States, 
see section 7425(d) and Sec. 301.7425-4.

[[Page 419]]

    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Under the law of State M, upon entry of judgment, the 
judgment creditor obtains a statutory lien upon the real property of the 
judgment debtor, and certain procedures are provided by which the 
judgment creditor may execute by public sale upon such real property. 
These procedures provide, among other things, for notification by 
personal service or registered or certified mail to other lien 
creditors, if any, and publication of a notice of the sale in a local 
newspaper. After the expiration of a prescribed period of time after 
such notification and publication, the sheriff of the county where the 
real property is located may sell the property at public sale. After 
payment of the amount bid at the public sale, the sheriff issues to the 
purchaser a deed to the real property, and the interests of junior 
lienors in the property are divested.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, such an execution sale is a 
nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) because the sale is made 
pursuant to a statutory lien on the property sold. The date of sale, for 
purposes of computing a period of time determined with reference to the 
date of sale, is the date on which the public sale is held because 
junior liens on the real property are divested directly as a result of 
the public sale. This result obtains even though the junior liens are 
legally divested on a later date when the sheriff issues the deed.
    Example 2. (i) Under the law of State N, mortgages on real property 
may contain a power of sale which authorizes the mortgagee, upon breach 
by the mortgagor of one of the conditions of the mortgage, to have the 
mortgaged property sold at public sale. This public sale must be 
preceded by notice by advertisement in a local newspaper, and the time, 
place, description of the property, and other terms of the sale must be 
specified. The purchaser at such a public sale obtains a title to the 
real property which is not subject to a right of redemption by the 
mortgagor and which divests the interests of the junior lienors in the 
property.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, a sale pursuant to such a power 
of sale is a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) because the 
sale is made pursuant to the mortgage instrument which created a lien on 
the property sold. The date of the sale, for purposes of computing a 
period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, is the 
date of the public sale because junior liens on the property are 
divested directly as a result of the public sale.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 2 except that the 
purchaser at the public sale obtains a title which is defeasible by the 
exercise of a right of redemption in the mortgagor. The purchaser's 
title divests the interests of junior lienors in the property as of the 
time of public sale. The interests of junior leinors in the property 
revive if the mortgagor exercises his right of redemption. The date of 
the sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with 
reference to the date of sale, is the date of the public sale because 
junior liens on the property are divested directly as a result of the 
public sale although such junior liens may be revived by a subsequent 
redemption by the mortgagor.
    Example 4. (i) Under the law of State O, upon breach by a mortgagor 
of real property of one of the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgagee 
may foreclose the mortgage by securing possession of the property by one 
of several procedures provided by statute. These procedures are 
generally referred to as ``strict foreclosure.'' In order for a 
foreclosure to be effective under these procedures, a certificate 
attesting the fact of entry must be recorded with the proper registrar 
of deeds within 30 days after the mortgagee enters the property. During 
the one-year period following the date on which the certificate of entry 
is recorded, the mortgagor or a junior lienor may redeem the property by 
paying the mortgagee the amount of the mortgage obligation. If, during 
such one-year period the property is not redeemed and the mortgagee's 
possession is continued, the interests of the mortgagor and the junior 
lienors in the property are divested as of the date such one-year period 
expires.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, such a foreclosure procedure is a 
nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) because it results in the 
divestment of the mortgagor's interest in the property by operation of 
law pursuant to the mortgage which created a lien on the property. In 
addition, because there is no public or private sale which directly 
results in the divestment of junior liens on the property, the date of 
sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with 
reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the one-year period 
following the recording of the certificate of entry expires.
    Example 5. The law of State P contains a procedure which permits a 
county to collect a delinquent tax assessment with respect to real 
property by the means of a tax sale of the property. First, a notice of 
a public auction with respect to the tax assessment on the real property 
is published in a local newspaper. At the public auction, the purchaser, 
upon payment of the delinquent taxes and interest, obtains from the 
county tax collector a tax certificate with respect to the real 
property. Because the obtaining of this tax certificate does not 
directly result in the divestment of either the owner's title or junior 
liens with respect to the property, the public auction is not a 
nonjudicial sale

[[Page 420]]

described in section 7425(b). At any time before a tax deed with respect 
to the property is issued by the clerk of the county court, the owner or 
any holder of a lien or other interest with respect to the property may 
obtain the tax certificate by paying the holder of the tax certificate 
the amount of the taxes, interest, and costs. After a date which is two 
years after the date on which the tax assessment became delinquent, the 
holder of the tax certificate may request the clerk of the county court 
to have the property advertised for sale. After advertisement of the 
sale, the clerk of the county court conducts a public sale of the real 
property and the purchaser obtains a tax deed. The interests of all 
junior lienors in the property are divested and the property is not 
subject to a right of redemption under the law of State P. For purposes 
of this section, this public sale is considered to be a nonjudicial sale 
described in section 7425(b) because the sale is made pursuant to a 
statutory lien on the property sold. The date of the sale, for purposes 
of computing a period of time determined with reference to the date of 
sale, is the date on which the public sale is held at which the 
purchaser obtains a tax deed as this sale directly results in the 
divestment of junior liens on the property.
    Example 6. The law of State Q contains a provision which permits a 
county to collect a delinquent tax assessment with respect to real 
property by the means of a tax sale of the property. After public notice 
is given, a ``tax sale'' of the real property is conducted. Upon payment 
of the delinquent taxes and interest, a purchaser obtains a tax 
certificate with respect to the real property. If there is no purchaser 
at the tax sale, the property is deemed to be bid in by the State. 
Because the obtaining of this tax certificate by a purchaser or State Q 
does not directly result in the divestment of either the owner's title 
or junior liens with respect to the property, the tax sale is not a 
nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b). Following the tax sale, 
there is a three-year period during which any person having an interest 
in the property may redeem the property by paying the holder of the tax 
certificate the amount of taxes, interest, and costs. Unless, redeemed, 
the holder of the tax certificate may obtain an absolute title at the 
expiration of the period of redemption provided he serves a notice of 
the expiration of the redemption period upon the owner at least 60 days 
prior to the date of expiration. Because there is no public or private 
sale which directly results in the divestment of junior liens on the 
property, the date of sale, for purposes of computing a period of time 
determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the 
holder of the tax certificate obtains absolute title.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7425-3  Discharge of liens; special rules.

    (a) Notice of sale requirements--(1) In general. Except in the case 
of the sale of perishable goods described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, a notice (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) of a 
nonjudicial sale shall be given, in writing by registered or certified 
mail or by personal service, not less than 25 days prior to the date of 
sale (determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7425-
2), to the district director (marked for the attention of the chief, 
special procedures staff) for the internal revenue district in which the 
sale is to be conducted. Thus, under this section, a notice of sale is 
not effective if it is given to a district director other than the 
district director for the internal revenue district in which the sale is 
to be conducted. The provisions of sections 7502 (relating to timely 
mailing treated as timely filing) and 7503 (relating to time for 
performance of acts where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday) apply in the case of notices required to be made under 
this paragraph.
    (2) Postponement of scheduled sale--(i) Where notice of sale is 
given. In the event that notice of a sale is given in accordance with 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), with respect to a scheduled sale 
which is postponed to a later time or date, the seller of the property 
is required to give notice of the postponement to the district director 
in the same manner as is required under local law with respect to other 
secured creditors. For example, assume that in State M local law 
requires that in the event of a postponement of a scheduled foreclosure 
sale of real property, an oral announcement of the postponement at the 
place and time of the scheduled sale constitutes sufficient notice to 
secured creditors of the postponement. Accordingly, if at the place and 
time of a scheduled sale in State M an oral announcement of the 
postponement is made, the Internal Revenue Service is considered to have 
notice of the postponement for the purpose of this subparagraph.
    (ii) Where notice of sale is not given. In the event that--

[[Page 421]]

    (A) Notice of a nonjudicial sale would not be required under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), if the sale were held on the 
originally scheduled date,
    (B) Because of a postponement of the scheduled sale, more than 30 
days elapse between the originally scheduled date of the sale and the 
date of the sale, and
    (C) A notice of lien with respect to the property to be sold is 
filed more than 30 days before the date of the sale, notice of the sale 
is required to be given to the district director in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In any case in which 
notice of sale is required to be given with respect to a scheduled sale, 
and notice of the sale is not given, any postponement of the scheduled 
sale does not affect the rights of the United States under section 
7425(b).
    (iii) Examples. The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A nonjudicial sale of Blackacre, belonging to A, a 
delinquent taxpayer, is scheduled for December 2, 1968. As no notice of 
lien is filed applicable to Blackacre more than 30 days before December 
2, 1968, no notice of sale is given to the district director. On 
December 2, 1968, the sale of Blackacre is postponed until January 15, 
1969. A notice of lien with respect to Blackacre is properly filed on 
January 2, 1969. The sale of blackacre is held on January 15, 1969. Even 
though more than 30 days elapsed between the originally scheduled date 
of the sale (December 2, 1968) and the date of the sale (January 15, 
1969), no notice of sale is required to be given to the district 
director because the notice of lien was not filed more than 30 days 
before the date of the sale.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that a 
notice of lien is filed on November 29, 1968, in accordance with section 
6323. Because more than 30 days elapsed between the originally scheduled 
date of the sale and the date of the sale, and the notice of lien is 
filed (on November 29, 1968) more than 30 days before the date of the 
sale (January 15, 1969), notice of the sale, in accordance with the 
provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, is required to be 
given to the distirct director.
    Example 3. A nonjudicial sale of Whiteacre, belonging to B, a 
delinquent taxpayer, is scheduled for December 2, 1968. A notice of lien 
applicable to Whiteacre is filed on November 12, 1968, in accordance 
with section 6323. As the notice of lien was not filed more than 30 days 
before December 2, 1968, no notice of sale is given to the district 
director. On December 2, 1968, the sale of Whiteacre is postponed until 
December 20, 1968. The sale of Whiteacre is held on December 20, 1968. 
Even though more than 30 days elapsed between the date notice of lien 
was filed (November 12, 1968) and the date of the sale (December 20, 
1968), no notice of sale is required to be given to the district 
director because not more than 30 days elapsed between the date of the 
originally scheduled sale (December 2, 1968) and the date the sale was 
actually held (December 20, 1968).

    (b) Consent to sale--(1) In general. Notwithstanding the notice of 
sale provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, a nonjudicial sale of 
property shall discharge or divest the property of the lien or title of 
the United States if the district director for the internal revenue 
district in which the sale occurs consents to the sale of the property 
free of the lien or title. Pursuant to section 7425(c)(2), where 
adequate protection is afforded the lien or title of the United States, 
a district director may, in his discretion, consent with respect to the 
sale of property in appropriate cases. Such consent shall be effective 
only if given in writing and shall be subject to such limitations and 
conditions as the district director may require. However, a district 
director may not consent to a sale of property under this section after 
the date of sale, as determined under paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7425-2. 
For provisions relating to the authority of the district director to 
release a lien or discharge property subject to a tax lien, see section 
6325 and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) Application for consent. Any person desiring a district 
director's consent to sell property free of a tax lien or a title 
derived from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States in the 
property shall submit to the district director for the internal revenue 
district in which the sale is to occur a written application, in 
triplicate, declaring that it is made under penalties of perjury, and 
requesting that such consent be given. The application shall contain the 
information required in the case of a notice of sale, as set forth in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and, in addition, shall contain a 
statement of the reasons why the consent is desired.

[[Page 422]]

    (c) Sale of perishable goods--(1) In general. A notice (as described 
in paragraph (d) of this section) of a nonjudicial sale of perishable 
goods (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)) shall be 
given in writing, by registered or certified mail or delivered by 
personal service, at any time before the sale, to the district director 
(marked for the attention of the chief, special procedures staff) for 
the internal revenue district in which the sale is to be conducted. 
Thus, under this section, a notice of sale is not effective if it is 
given to a district director other than the district director for the 
internal revenue district in which the sale is to be conducted. If a 
notice of a nonjudicial sale is timely given in the manner described in 
this paragraph, the nonjudicial sale shall discharge or divest the tax 
lien, or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien, of the 
United States in the property. The provisions of sections 7502 (relating 
to timely mailing treated as timely filing) and 7503 (relating to time 
for performance of acts where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or 
a legal holiday) apply in the case of notices required to be made under 
this paragraph. The seller of the perishable goods shall hold the 
proceeds (exclusive of costs) of the sale as a fund, for not less than 
30 days after the date of the sale, subject to the liens and claims of 
the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the 
liens and claims of the United States had with respect to the property 
sold. If the seller fails to hold the proceeds of the sale in accordance 
with the provisions of this paragraph and if the district director 
asserts a claim to the proceeds within 30 days after the date of sale, 
the seller shall be personally liable to the United States for an amount 
equal to the value of the interest of the United States in the fund. 
However, even if the proceeds of the sale are not so held by the seller, 
but all the other provisions of this paragraph are satisfied, the buyer 
of the property at the sale takes the property free of the liens and 
claims of the United States. In the event of a postponement of the 
scheduled sale of perishable goods, the seller is not required to notify 
the district director of the postponement. For provisions relating to 
the authority of the district director to release a lien or discharge 
property subject to a tax lien, see section 6325 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (2) Definition of perishable goods. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, the term ``perishable goods'' means any tangible personal 
property which, in the reasonable view of the person selling the 
property, is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or 
value by keeping, or cannot be kept without great expense.
    (d) Content of notice of sale--(1) In general. With respect to a 
notice of sale described in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the 
notice will be considered adequate if it contains the information 
described in paragraph (d)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section.
    (i) The name and address of the person submitting the notice of 
sale;
    (ii) A copy of each notice of Federal Tax Lien (Form 668) affecting 
the property to be sold, or the following information as shown on each 
such Notice of Federal Tax Lien--
    (A) The internal revenue district named thereon,
    (B) The name and address of the taxpayer, and
    (C) The date and place of filing of the notice;
    (iii) With respect to the property to be sold, the following 
information--
    (A) A detailed description, including location, of the property 
affected by the notice (in the case of real property, the street 
address, city, and State and the legal description contained in the 
title or deed to the property and, if available, a copy of the abstract 
of title),
    (B) The date, time, place, and terms of the proposed sale of the 
property, and
    (C) In the case of a sale of perishable property described in 
paragraph (c) of this section, a statement of the reasons why the 
property is believed to be perishable; and
    (iv) The approximate amount of the principal obligation, including 
interest, secured by the lien sought to be enforced and a description of 
the other expenses (such as legal expenses, selling costs, etc.) which 
may be charged against the sale proceeds.

[[Page 423]]

    (2) Inadequate notice. Except as otherwise provided in this 
subparagraph, a notice of sale described in paragraph (a) of this 
section which does not contain the information described in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section shall be considered inadequate by a district 
director. If a district director determines that the notice is 
inadequate, he will give written notification of the items of 
information which are inadequate to the person who submitted the notice. 
A notice of sale which does not contain the name and address of the 
person submitting such notice shall be considered to be inadequate for 
all purposes without notification of any specific inadequacy. In any 
case where a notice of sale, given after December 31, 1976, does not 
contain the information required under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this 
section with respect to a Notice of Federal Tax Lien, the district 
director may give written notification of such omission without 
specification of any other inadequacy and such notice of sale shall be 
considered inadequate for all purposes. In the event the district 
director gives notification that the notice of sale is inadequate, a 
notice complying with the provisions of this section (including the 
requirement that the notice be given not less than 25 days prior to the 
sale in the case of a notice described in paragraph (a) of this section) 
must be given. However, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, in such a case the district director may, in his 
discretion, consent to the sale of the property free of the lien or 
title of the United States even though notice of the sale is given less 
than 25 days prior to the sale. In any case where the person who 
submitted a timely notice which indicates his name and address does not 
receive, more than 5 days prior to the date of the sale, written 
notification from the district director that the notice is inadequate, 
the notice shall be considered adequate for purposes of this section.
    (3) Acknowledgment of notice. If a notice of sale described in 
paragraph (a) or (c) of this section is submitted in duplicate to the 
district director with a written request that receipt of the notice be 
acknowledged and returned to the person giving the notice, this request 
will be honored by the district director. The acknowledgement by the 
district director will indicate the date and time of the receipt of the 
notice.
    (4) Disclosure of adequacy of notice. The district director for the 
internal revenue district in which the sale was held or is to be held is 
authorized to disclose, to any person who has a proper interest, whether 
an adequate notice of sale was given under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. Any person desiring this information should submit to the 
district director a written request which clearly describes the property 
sold or to be sold, identifies the applicable notice of lien, gives the 
reasons for requesting the information, and states the name and address 
of the person making the request.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7425-4  Discharge of liens; redemption by United States.

    (a) Right to redeem--(1) In general. In the case of a nonjudicial 
sale of real property to satisfy a lien prior to the tax lien or a title 
derived from the enforcement of a tax lien, the district director may 
redeem the property within the redemption period (as described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The right of redemption of the United 
States exists under section 7425(d) even though the district director 
has consented to the sale under section 7425(c)(2) and Sec. 301.7425--
3(b). For purposes of this section, the term ``nonjudicial sale'' shall 
have the same meaning as used in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.7425-2.
    (2) Redemption period. For purposes of this section, the redemption 
period shall be--
    (i) The period beginning with the date of the sale (as determined 
under paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7425-2) and ending with the 120th day 
after such date, or
    (ii) The period for redemption of real property allowable with 
respect to other secured creditors, under the local law of the place 
where the real property is located, whichever expires later. Whichever 
period is applicable, section 7425 and this section shall govern the 
amount to be paid and the procedure to be followed.

[[Page 424]]

    (3) Limitations. In the event a sale does not ultimately discharge 
the property from the tax lien (whether by reason of local law or the 
provisions of section 7425(b)), the provisions of this section do not 
apply because the tax lien will continue to attach to the property after 
the sale. In a case in which the Internal Revenue Service is not 
entitled to a notice of sale under section 7425(b) and Sec. 301.7425-3, 
the United States does not have a right of redemption under section 
7425(d). However, in such a case, if a tax lien has attached to the 
property at the time of sale, the United States has the same right of 
redemption, if any, which is afforded similar creditors under the local 
law of the place in which the property is situated.
    (b) Amount to be paid--(1) In general. In any case in which a 
district director exercises the right to redeem real property under 
section 7425(d), the amount to be paid is the sum of the following 
amounts--
    (i) The actual amount paid for the property (as determined under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) being redeemed (which, in the case of 
a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall 
include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent 
legally satisfied by reason of the sale);
    (ii) Interest on the amount paid (described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section) at the sale by the purchaser of the real property 
computed at the rate of 6 percent per annum for the period from the date 
of the sale (as determined under paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7425-2) to 
the date of redemption;
    (iii) The amount, if any, equal to the excess of (A) the expenses 
necessarily incurred to maintain such property (as determined under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section) by the purchaser (and his successor in 
interest, if any) over (B) the income from such property realized by the 
purchaser (and his successor in interest, if any) plus a reasonable 
rental value of such property (to the extent the property is used by or 
with the consent of the purchaser or his successor in interest or is 
rented at less than its reasonable rental value); and
    (iv) With respect to a redemption made after December 31, 1976, the 
amounts, if any, of a payment made by the purchaser or his successor in 
interest after the foreclosure sale to a holder of a senior lien (to the 
extent provided under paragraph (b)(4) of this section).
    (2) Actual amount paid. (i) The actual amount paid for property by a 
purchaser, other than holder of the lien being foreclosed, is the amount 
paid by him at the sale. For purposes of this subdivision, the amount 
paid by the purchaser at the sale includes deferred payments upon the 
bid price. The actual amount paid does not include costs and expenses 
incurred prior to the foreclosure sale by the purchaser except to the 
extent such expenses are included in the amount bid and paid for the 
property. For example, the actual amount paid does not normally include 
the expenses of the purchaser such as title searches, professional fees, 
or interest on debt incurred to obtain funds to purchase the property.
    (ii) In the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being 
foreclosed, the actual amount paid is the sum of (A) the amount of the 
obligation secured by such lien to the extent legally satisfied by 
reason of the sale and (B) any additional amount bid and paid at the 
sale. For purposes of this section, a purchaser who acquires title as a 
result of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale is treated as the holder of the 
lien being foreclosed if a lien (or any interest reserved, created, or 
conveyed as security for the payment of a debt or fulfillment of other 
obligation) held by him is partially or fully satisfied by reason of the 
foreclosure sale. For example, a person whose title is derived from a 
tax deed issued under local law shall be treated as a purchaser who is 
the holder of the lien foreclosed in a case where a tax certificate, 
evidencing a lien on the property arising from the payment of property 
taxes, ripens into title. The amount paid by a purchaser at the sale 
includes deferred payments upon any portion of the bid price which is in 
excess of the amount of the lien being foreclosed. The actual amount 
paid does not include costs and expenses incurred prior to the 
foreclosure sale by the purchaser except to the extent such expenses are 
included in the amount of the lien being foreclosed

[[Page 425]]

which is legally satisfied by reason of the sale or in the amount bid 
and paid at the sale. Where the lien being foreclosed attaches to other 
property not subject to the foreclosure sale, the amount legally 
satisfied by reason of the sale does not include the amount of such lien 
that attaches to the other property. However, for purposes of the 
preceding sentence, the amount of the lien that attaches to the other 
property shall be considered to be equal to the amount by which the 
value of the other property exceeds the amount of any other senior lien 
on that property. Where, after the sale, the holder of the lien being 
foreclosed has the right to the unpaid balance of the amount due him, 
the amount legally satisfied by reason of the sale does not include the 
amount of such lien to the extent a deficiency judgment may be obtained 
therefor. However, for purposes of the preceding sentence, an amount, 
with respect to which the holder of the lien being foreclosed would 
otherwise have a right to a deficiency judgment, shall be considered to 
be legally satisfied by reason of the foreclosure sale to the extent 
that the holder has waived his right to a deficiency judgment prior to 
the foreclosure sale. For this purpose, the waiver must be in writing 
and legally binding upon the foreclosing lienholder as of the time the 
sale is concluded. If, prior to the foreclosure, payments have been made 
by the foreclosing lienholder to a holder of a superior lien, the 
payments are included in the actual amount paid to the extent they give 
rise to an interest which is legally satisfied by reason of the 
foreclosure sale.
    (3) Excess expenses incurred by purchaser. (i) Expenses necessarily 
incurred in connection with the property after the foreclosure sale and 
before redemption by the United States are taken into account in 
determining if there are excess expenses payable under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section. Expenses incurred by the purchaser prior to 
the foreclosure sale are not considered under this subparagraph. (See 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for circumstances under which such 
expenses may be included in the amount to be paid.) Expenses necessarily 
incurred in connection with the property include, for example, rental 
agent commissions, repair and maintenance expenses, utilities expenses, 
legal fees incurred after the foreclosure sale and prior to redemption 
in defending the title acquired through the foreclosure sale, and a 
proportionate amount of casualty insurance premiums and ad valorem 
taxes. Improvements made to the property are not considered as an 
expense unless the amounts incurred for such improvements are 
necessarily incurred to maintain the property.
    (ii) At any time prior to the expiration of the redemption period 
applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the district director 
may, by certified or registered mail or hand delivery, request a written 
itemized statement of the amount claimed by the purchaser or his 
successor in interest to be payable under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section. Unless the purchaser or his successor in interest furnishes the 
written itemized statement within 15 days after the request is made by 
the district director, it shall be presumed that no amount is payable 
for expenses in excess of income and the Internal Revenue Service shall 
tender only the amount otherwise payable under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. If a purchaser or his or her successor in interest has failed 
to furnish the written itemized statement within 15 days after the 
request therefor is made by the district director, or there is a 
disagreement as to the amount properly payable under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section, or if there were additional excess expenses 
that were not claimed in the original itemized statement, the purchaser 
or his or her successor in interest may submit a written itemized 
statement to the district director within 30 days after the date of 
redemption. If the purchaser or his or her successor in interest fails 
to timely submit such a written itemized statement, no amount shall be 
payable for expenses in excess of income.
    (4) Payments made by purchaser or his successor in interest to a 
senior lienor. (i) The amount to be paid upon a redemption by the United 
States made after December 31, 1976, shall include the

[[Page 426]]

amount of a payment made by the purchaser or his successor in interest 
to a holder of a senior lien to the extent a request for the 
reimbursement thereof (made in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of 
this section) is approved as provided under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of 
this section. This paragraph applies only to a payment made after the 
foreclosure sale and before the redemption to a holder of a lien that 
was, immediately prior to the foreclosure sale, superior to the lien 
foreclosed. A payment of principal or interest to a senior lienor shall 
be taken into account. Generally, the portion, if any, of a payment 
which is to be held in escrow for the payment of an expense, such as 
hazard insurance or real property taxes, is not considered under this 
paragraph. However, a payment by the escrow agent of a real property tax 
or special assessment lien, which was senior to the lien foreclosed, 
shall be considered to be a payment made by the purchaser or his 
successor in interest for purposes of this paragraph. With respect to 
real property taxes assessed after the foreclosure sale, see paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section, relating to excess expenses incurred by the 
purchaser.
    (ii) Before the expiration of the redemption period applicable under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the district director shall, in any 
case where a redemption is contemplated, send notice to the purchaser 
(or his successor in interest of record) by certified or registered mail 
or hand delivery of his right under this subparagraph to request 
reimbursement (payable in the event the right to redeem under section 
7425(d) is exercised) for a payment made to a senior lienor. No later 
than 15 days after the notice from the district director is sent, the 
request for reimbursement shall be mailed or delivered to the office 
specified in such notice and shall consist of--
    (A) A written itemized statement, signed by the claimant, of the 
amount claimed with respect to a payment made to a senior lienor, 
together with the supporting evidence requested in the notice from the 
district director, and
    (B) A waiver or other document that will be effective upon 
redemption by the United States to discharge the property from, or 
transfer to the United States, any interest in or lien on the property 
that may arise under local law with respect to the payment made to a 
senior lienor.

Upon a showing of reasonable cause, a district director may, in his 
discretion and at any time before the expiration of the applicable 
period for redemption, grant an extension for a reasonable period of 
time to submit, amend, or supplement a request for reimbursement. Unless 
a request for reimbursement is timely submitted (determined with regard 
to any extension of time granted), no amount shall be payable to the 
purchaser or his successor in interest on account of a payment made to a 
senior lienor if the right to redeem under section 7425(d) is exercised. 
A waiver or other document submitted pursuant to this subdivision shall 
be treated as effective only to the extent of the amount included in the 
redemption price under this paragraph. If the right to redeem is not 
exercised or a request for reimbursement is withdrawn, the district 
director shall, by certified or registered mail or hand delivery, return 
to the purchaser or his successor any waiver or other document submitted 
pursuant to this subdivision as soon as is practicable.
    (iii) A request for reimbursement submitted in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section shall be considered to be approved 
for the total amount claimed by the purchaser, and payable in the event 
the right to redeem is exercised, unless the district director sends 
notice to the claimant, by certified or registered mail or hand 
delivery, of the denial of the amount claimed within 30 days after 
receipt of the request or 15 days before expiration of the applicable 
period for redemption, whichever is later. The notification of denial 
shall state the grounds for denial. If such notice of denial is given, 
the request for reimbursement for a payment made to a senior lienor 
shall be treated as having been withdrawn by the purchaser or his 
successor and the Internal Revenue Service shall tender only the amount 
otherwise payable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If a request 
for reimbursement is treated as having been withdrawn under the

[[Page 427]]

preceding sentence, payment for amounts described in this subparagraph 
may, in the discretion of the district director, be made after the 
redemption upon the resolution of the disagreement as to the amount 
properly payable under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (5) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a delinquent taxpayer, owns Blackacre located in State 
X upon which B holds a mortgage. After the mortgage is properly 
recorded, a notice of tax lien is filed under section 6323(f) which is 
applicable to Blackacre. Subsequently, A defaults on the mortgage and B 
forecloses on the mortgage which has an outstanding obligation in the 
amount of $1,000. At the foreclosure sale, B bids $50,000 and obtains 
title to Blackacre as a result of the sale. At the time of the 
foreclosure sale, Blackacre has a fair market value of $75,000. Under 
the laws of State X, the mortgage obligation is fully satisfied by 
operation of the foreclosure sale per se and the mortgagee cannot obtain 
a deficiency judgment. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the 
district director must pay $100,000 in order to redeem Blackacre.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that under 
the laws of State X, the amount bid is the amount of the obligation 
legally satisfied as a result of the foreclosure sale, and in the case 
in which the amount of the obligation exceeds the amount bid, the 
mortgagee has the right to a judgment for the deficiency computed as the 
difference between the amount of the obligation and the amount bid. B 
does not waive, prior to the foreclosure sale, his right to a deficiency 
judgment. In such a case, the district director must, under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, pay $50,000 in order to redeem Blackacre, 
whether or not B seeks a judgment for the deficiency.
    Example 3. C, a delinquent taxpayer, owns Greenacre located in State 
Y upon which D holds a first mortgage and E holds a second mortgage. 
After the mortgages are properly recorded, a notice of tax lien is filed 
under section 6323(f) which is applicable to Greenacre. Subsequently, C 
defaults on both mortgages and E pays $5,000 to D, which is the portion 
of D's obligation which is in default. The second mortgage held by E is 
an outstanding obligation in the amount of $100,000. Under the laws of 
State Y, E may treat the amount paid to D as an addition to his second 
mortgage upon foreclosure by him. E forecloses upon the security 
interest held by him. At the foreclosure sale, E bids $50,000 and 
obtains title to Greenacre subject to D's mortgage as a result of the 
foreclosure sale. Under the laws of State Y, the mortgage obligation 
legally satisfied is the amount bid and E has the right to a judgment 
for a deficiency in the amount of $55,000 ($100,000 plus $5,000 less 
$50,000). In such a case, the district director must, under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, pay $50,000 in order to redeem Greenacre, 
whether or not E seeks a judgment for the deficiency.
    Example 4. The law of State Z contains a procedure which permits a 
county to collect a delinquent tax assessment with respect to real 
property by the means of a ``tax sale'' of the property. Pursuant to 
this procedure, a public auction is conducted on January 15, 1970, to 
collect the delinquent property taxes assessed against Whiteacre, which 
is owned by F. At the auction, a bid of $1,000 (representing the tax, 
costs, and interest due at the time of the auction) is made by G. 
Subsequently, G pays the amount bid to the county and obtains a tax 
certificate with respect to Whiteacre. Under this tax sale procedure, 
the obtaining of the tax certificate does not directly result in the 
divestment of either F's title or any junior liens on Whiteacre. On 
January 15, 1973, the period under this tax sale procedure during which 
F could have redeemed Whiteacre expires. Further, more than 30 days 
before January 15, 1973, a notice of tax lien affecting Whiteacre is 
filed under section 6323(f) with respect to F's delinquent Federal 
income taxes. Under the state tax sale procedure, the amount which would 
be required to be paid by F to G on January 15, 1973, to redeem 
Whiteacre is $1,350 (the $1,000 amount bid, interest of $300, and costs 
of $50). However, Whiteacre is not redeemed by F under the state 
procedure and, on January 16, 1973, G obtains a tax deed to Whiteacre. 
Under the law of State Z, the issuance of the tax deed results in the 
divestment of F's title and junior liens on Whiteacre. Thus, under 
Sec. 301.7425-2(b), the date of sale is January 16, 1973, for purposes 
of section 7425(b). The amount legally satisfied by reason of the sale 
is the amount G is entitled to receive, immediately prior to the 
expiration of the period for redemption under the law of State Z, if 
Whiteacre were redeemed at such time. Thus, the district director must, 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, pay $1,350 in order to redeem 
Whiteacre.

    (c) Certificate of redemption--(1) In general. If a district 
director exercise the right of redemption of the United States described 
in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall apply to the officer 
designated by local law, if any, for the documents necessary to evidence 
the fact of redemption and to record title to the redeemed property in 
the name of the United States. If no such officer has been designated by 
local law or if the officer designated by local law fails to issue the 
necessary documents,

[[Page 428]]

the district director is authorized to issue a certificate of redemption 
for the property redeemed by the United States.
    (2) Filing. The district director shall, without delay, cause either 
the documents issued by the local officer or the certificate of 
redemption executed by the district director to be filed with the local 
office where certificates of redemption are generally filed. If a 
certificate of redemption is issued by the district director and if the 
State in which the real property redeemed by the United States is 
situated has no office with which certificates of redemption may be 
filed, the district director shall file the certificate of redemption in 
the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the 
judicial district in which the redeemed property is situated.
    (3) Effect of certificate of redemption. A certificate of redemption 
executed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall constitute 
prima facie evidence of the regularity of the redemption. When a 
certificate of redemption is recorded, it shall transfer to the United 
States all the rights, title, and interest in and to the redeemed 
property acquired by the person, from whom the district director 
redeemed the property, by virtue of the sale of the property. Therefore, 
if under local law the purchaser takes title free of liens junior to the 
lien of the foreclosing lienholder, the United States takes title free 
of such junior liens upon redemption of the property. If a certificate 
of redemption has been erroneously prepared and filed because the 
redemption was not effective, the district director shall issue a 
document revoking such certificate of redemption and such document shall 
be conclusively binding upon the United States against a purchaser of 
the property or a holder of a lien upon the property.
    (4) Application for release of right of redemption. Upon application 
of a party with a proper interest in the real property sold in a 
nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) and Sec. 301.7425-2 which 
real property is subject to the right of redemption of the United States 
described in this section, the district director may, in his discretion, 
release the right of redemption with respect to the property. The 
application for the release shall be submitted in writing to a district 
director and shall contain such information as the district director may 
require. If the district director determines that the right of 
redemption of the United States is without value, no amount shall be 
required to be paid with respect to the release of the right of 
redemption.

28720, June 2, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7426-1  Civil actions by persons other than taxpayers.

    (a) Actions permitted--(1) Wrongful levy--(i) In general. If a levy 
has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, 
any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out 
of which such levy arose) may bring a civil action against the United 
States in a district court of the United States based upon such person's 
claim--
    (A) That such person has an interest in, or lien on, such property 
which is senior to the interest of the United States; and
    (B) That such property was wrongfully levied upon.
    (ii) Debt owed by another Federal agency. Section 7426 and this 
paragraph (a) apply when a levy is made by the Internal Revenue Service 
on a debt owed to a taxpayer by another Federal agency. By contrast, 
section 7426 and this paragraph (a) do not apply if the Internal Revenue 
Service requests payment from another Federal agency pursuant to a 
request for setoff.
    (2) Surplus proceeds. If property has been sold pursuant to levy, 
any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out 
of which such levy arose) may bring a civil action against the United 
States in a district court of the United States based upon such person's 
claim that he--
    (i) Has an interest in or lien on such property junior to that of 
the United States; and
    (ii) Is entitled to the surplus proceeds of such sale.
    (3) Substituted sale proceeds. Any person who claims to be legally 
entitled to all or any part of the amount which is

[[Page 429]]

held as a fund from the sale of property pursuant to an agreement 
described in section 6325(b)(3) may bring a civil action against the 
United States in a district court of the United States to obtain the 
relief provided by section 7426 (b)(4). It is not necessary that the 
claimant be a party to the agreement which provides for the substitution 
of the sale proceeds for the property subject to the lien.
    (b) Adjudication--(1) Wrongful levy. If the court determines that 
property has been wrongfully levied upon, the court may--
    (i) Grant an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of such levy or 
to prohibit a sale of such property if such sale would irreparably 
injure rights in the property which are superior to the rights of the 
United States in such property; or
    (ii) Order the return of specific property if the United States is 
in possession of such property; or
    (iii) Grant a judgment for the amount of money levied upon; or
    (iv) Grant a judgment for an amount not exceeding the amount 
received by the United States from the sale of such property (which, in 
the case of property declared purchased by the United States at a sale, 
shall be the greater of the minimum amount determined pursuant to 
section 6335(e) or the amount received by the United States from the 
resale of such property).

For purposes of this paragraph, a levy is wrongful against a person 
(other than the taxpayer against whom the assessment giving rise to the 
levy is made), if (a) the levy is upon property exempt from levy under 
section 6334, or (b) the levy is upon property in which the taxpayer had 
no interest at the time the lien arose or thereafter, or (c) the levy is 
upon property with respect to which such person is a purchaser against 
whom the lien is invalid under section 6323 or 6324 (a)(2) or (b), or 
(d) the levy or sale pursuant to levy will or does effectively destroy 
or otherwise irreparably injure such person's interest in the property 
which is senior to the Federal tax lien. A levy may be wrongful against 
a holder of a senior lien upon the taxpayer's property under certain 
circumstances although legal rights to enforce his interest survive the 
levy procedure. For example, the levy may be wrongful against such a 
person if the property is an obligation which is collected pursuant to 
the levy rather than sold and nothing thereafter remains for the senior 
lienholder, or the property levied upon is of such a nature that when it 
is sold at a public sale the property subject to the senior lien is not 
available for the senior lienholder as a realistic source for the 
enforcement of his interest. Some of the factors which should be taken 
into account in determining whether property remains or will remain a 
realistic source from which the senior lienholder may realize collection 
are: (1) The nature of the property, (2) the number of purchasers, (3) 
the value of each unit sold or to be sold, (4) whether, as a direct 
result of the distraint sale, the costs of realizing collection from the 
security have or will be so substantially increased as to render the 
security substantially valueless as a source of collection, and (5) 
whether the property subject to the distraint sale constitutes 
substantially all of the property available as security for the payment 
of the indebtedness to the senior lienholder.
    (2) Example. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(b) may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. On April 10, 1972, A makes a $10,000 loan to B which is 
partially secured by a $5,000 obligation owed to B by C. Under local 
law, A's security interest in the obligation owed to B by C is protected 
against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured 
obligation. Thus, under section 6323(h)(1), A's security interest exists 
as of April 10, 1972, for purposes of determining priorities against a 
tax lien under section 6323. On April 17, 1972, an assessment of $6,000 
is made against B with respect to his delinquent Federal tax liability. 
Thereafter, notice of lien is filed pursuant to section 6323(f) with 
respect to B's delinquent tax liability. On July 10, 1972, a notice of 
levy is served upon C to reach the amount owed by him to B. C pays over 
the $5,000 obligation in satisfaction of the levy and, under local law, 
the obligation is discharged as to A. Because the levy effectively 
destroyed A's senior security interest in the obligation owed to B by C, 
the levy is wrongful as to A for purposes of section 7426. Under these 
circumstances, the levy is wrongful with respect to A even if, under 
local law. A may have a cause of action in contract against B for the 
$10,000 loan

[[Page 430]]

or may have a cause of action in tort against C for the amount of the 
$5,000 payment which defeated A's security interest in the obligation 
owed by C to B.

    (3) Surplus proceeds. If the court determines that the interest or 
lien of any party to an action under section 7426 was transferred to the 
proceeds of a sale of the property, the court may grant a judgment in an 
amount equal to all or any part of the amount of the surplus proceeds of 
such sale. The term ``surplus proceeds'' means those proceeds realized 
on a sale of property remaining after application of the provisions of 
section 6342(a).
    (4) Substituted sale proceeds. If the court determines that a party 
has an interest in or lien on the amount held as a fund pursuant to an 
agreement described in section 6325(b)(3), the court may grant a 
judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of such 
fund.
    (c) Effective date. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section is effective as 
of December 23, 1993.

Sec. 301.7429-1  Review of jeopardy and termination assessment and jeopardy levy procedures; information to taxpayer.

    Not later than 5 days after the day on which an assessment is made 
under section 6851(a), 6852(a), 6861(a), or 6862, or a levy is made 
under section 6331(a) without complying with the notice before levy 
provisions of section 6331(d), the district director shall provide the 
taxpayer a written statement setting forth the information upon which 
the district director relies in authorizing such assessment or levy.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7429-2  Review of jeopardy and termination assessment and jeopardy levy procedures.

    (a) Request for administrative review. Any request for the review of 
a jeopardy or termination assessment or jeopardy levy provided for by 
section 7429(a)(2) shall be filed with the district director within 30 
days after the statement described in Sec. 301.7429-1 is given to the 
taxpayer. However, if no statement is given within the 5 day period 
described in Sec. 301.7429-1, any request for review of the jeopardy or 
termination assessment or jeopardy levy shall be filed within 35 days 
after the date such assessment or levy is made. Such request shall be in 
writing, shall state fully the reasons for the request, and shall be 
supported by such evidence as will enable the district director to make 
the redetermination described in section 7429(a)(3).
    (b) Administrative review. In determining whether the assessment is 
reasonable and the amount assessed is appropriate, or whether the 
jeopardy levy is reasonable, the district director shall take into 
account not only information available at the time the assessment or 
jeopardy levy is made but also information which subsequently becomes 
available.
    (c) Abatement of assessment. For rules relating to the abatement of 
assessments made under sections 6851 and 6861 see Sec. Sec. 301.6861-
1(e), 301.6861-1(f) and 1.6851-1(d) of this chapter.

Sec. 301.7429-3  Review of jeopardy and termination assessment and jeopardy levy procedures; judicial action.

    (a) Time for bringing judicial action. An action for judicial review 
described in section 7429(b) may be instituted by the taxpayer during 
the period beginning on the earlier of--
    (1) The date the district director notifies the taxpayer of the 
determination described in section 7429(a)(3) and ending on the 90th day 
thereafter; or
    (2) The 16th day after the request described in section 7429(a)(2) 
was made by the taxpayer and ending on the 90th day thereafter.
    (b) Extension of period for judicial review. The United States 
Government may not by itself seek an extension of the 20 day period 
described in section 7429(b)(3), but it may join with the taxpayer in 
seeking such an extension.
    (c) Jurisdiction for determination.--In general, the United States 
district court will have exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action 
for a determination described in section 7429(b). However, if a petition 
for a redetermination of a deficiency has been timely

[[Page 431]]

filed with the Tax Court prior to the making of an assessment or levy 
that is subject to the section 7429 review procedures, and one or more 
of the taxes and tax periods before the Tax Court as a result of the 
petition is also included in the written statement that was provided to 
the taxpayer, then the Tax Court will have jurisdiction concurrent with 
the district courts over any civil action for a judicial determination 
with respect to all the taxes and tax periods included in the written 
statement. In all other cases, the appropriate United States district 
court continues to have exclusive jurisdiction over such an action.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7430-1  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

    (a) In general. Section 7430(b)(1) provides that a court shall not 
award reasonable litigation costs in any civil tax proceeding under 
section 7430(a) unless the court determines that the prevailing party 
has exhausted the administrative remedies available to the party within 
the Internal Revenue Service. This section sets forth the circumstances 
in which such administrative remedies shall be deemed to have been 
exhausted.
    (b) Requirements--(1) In general. A party has not exhausted the 
administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service 
with respect to any tax matter for which an Appeals office conference is 
available under Secs. 601.105 and 601.106 of this chapter (other than a 
tax matter described in paragraph (c) of this section) unless--
    (i) The party, prior to filing a petition in the Tax Court or a 
civil action for refund in a court of the United States (including the 
Court of Federal Claims), participates, either in person or through a 
qualified representative described in Sec. 601.502 of this chapter, in 
an Appeals office conference; or
    (ii) If no Appeals office conference is granted, the party, prior to 
the issuance of a statutory notice in the case of a petition in the Tax 
Court or the issuance of a notice of disallowance in the case of a civil 
action for refund in a court of the United States (including the Court 
of Federal Claims)--
    (A) Requests an Appeals office conference in accordance with 
Secs. 601.105 and 601.106 of this chapter; and
    (B) Files a written protest if a written protest is required to 
obtain an Appeals office conference.
    (2) Participates. For purposes of this section, a party or qualified 
representative of the party described in Sec. 601.502 of this chapter 
participates in an Appeals office conference if the party or qualified 
representative discloses to the Appeals office all relevant information 
regarding the party's tax matter to the extent such information and its 
relevance were known or should have been known to the party or qualified 
representative at the time of such conference.
    (3) Tax matter. For purposes of this section, ``tax matter'' means a 
matter in connection with the determination, collection or refund of any 
tax, interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount under the 
Internal Revenue Code.
    (c) Revocation of a determination that an organization is described 
in section 501(c)(3). A party has not exhausted the administrative 
remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service with respect to a 
revocation of a determination that it is an organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) unless, prior to filing a declaratory judgment action 
under section 7428, the party has exhausted its administrative remedies 
in accordance with section 7428, and any regulations, rules, and revenue 
procedures thereunder.
    (d) Actions involving summonses, levies, liens, jeopardy and 
termination assessments, etc. (1) A party has not exhausted the 
administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service 
with respect to a matter other than one to which paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section applies (including summonses, levies, liens, and jeopardy 
and termination assessments) unless, prior to filing an action in a 
court of the United States (including the Tax Court and the Court of 
Federal Claims)--
    (i) The party submits to the district director of the district 
having jurisdiction over the dispute a written claim for relief reciting 
facts and circumstances sufficient to show the nature of the relief 
requested and that the party is entitled to such relief; and
    (ii) The district director has denied the claim for relief in 
writing or failed to act on the claim within a reasonable period after 
such claim is received by the district director.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), a reasonable period is--
    (i) The 5-day period preceding the filing of a petition to quash an 
administrative summons issued under section 7609;
    (ii) The 5-day period preceding the filing of a wrongful levy action 
in which a demand for the return of property is made;
    (iii) The period expressly provided for administrative review of the 
party's claim by an applicable provision of the

[[Page 433]]

Internal Revenue Code that expressly provides for the pursuit of 
administrative remedies (such as the 16-day period provided under 
section 7429(b)(1)(B) relating to review of jeopardy assessment 
procedures); or
    (iv) The 60-day period following receipt of the claim for relief in 
all other cases.
    (e) Exception to requirement that party pursue administrative 
remedies. If the conditions set forth in paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), 
(e)(3), or (e)(4) of this section are satisfied, a party's 
administrative remedies within the Internal Revenue Service shall be 
deemed to have been exhausted for purposes of section 7430.
    (1) The Internal Revenue Service notifies the party in writing that 
the pursuit of administrative remedies in accordance with paragraphs 
(b), (c), and (d) of this section is unnecessary.
    (2) In the case of a petition in the Tax Court--
    (i) The party did not receive a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter) prior to the issuance of the statutory notice and the 
failure to receive such notice was not due to actions of the party (such 
as a failure to supply requested information or a current mailing 
address to the district director or service center having jurisdiction 
over the tax matter); and
    (ii) The party does not refuse to participate in an Appeals office 
conference while the case is in docketed status.
    (3) In the case of a civil action for refund involving a tax matter 
other than a tax matter described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, 
the party--
    (i) Participates in an Appeals office conference with respect to the 
tax matter prior to issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency with 
respect to such tax matter; or
    (ii) Did not receive written notification that an Appeals office 
conference was available prior to issuance of a notice of disallowance 
and the failure to receive such a notification was not due to the 
actions of the party (such as the failure to supply requested 
information or a current mailing address to the district director or 
service center having jurisdiction over the tax matter); or
    (iii) Did not receive either written or oral notification that an 
Appeals office conference had been granted within six months from the 
date of the filing of the claim for refund and the failure to receive 
such notice was not due to actions of the party (such as the failure to 
supply requested information or a current mailing address to the 
district director or service center having jurisdiction over the tax 
matter).
    (4) In the case of a civil action for refund involving a tax matter 
under sections 6703 or 6694--
    (i) The party did not receive a notice of proposed disallowance 
prior to issuance of a notice of disallowance and the failure to receive 
such notice was not due to actions of the party (such as the failure to 
supply requested information or a current mailing address to the 
district director or service center having jurisdiction over the tax 
matter); or
    (ii) During the six-month period following the day on which the 
party's claim for refund is filed, the party's claim for refund is not 
denied, and the Internal Revenue Service has failed to process the claim 
with due diligence.
    (f) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. Taxpayer A exchanges property held for investment for 
similar property and claims that the gain on the exchange is not 
recognized under section 1031. The Internal Revenue Service conducts a 
field examination and determines that there has not been a like-kind 
exchange. No agreement is reached on the matter and a notice of proposed 
deficiency (30-day letter) is sent to A. A does not file a request for 
an Appeals office conference. A pays the amount of the proposed 
deficiency and files a claim for refund. A notice of proposed 
disallowance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service. A does not 
request an Appeals office conference and, instead, files a civil action 
for refund in a United States District Court. A has not exhausted the 
administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that, after 
receiving the notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter), A files a 
request for an Appeals office conference. No agreement is reached at the 
conference. A pays the amount of the proposed deficiency and files a 
claim for refund. A notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the 
Internal Revenue Service. A does not request an Appeals office 
conference and files a civil action for refund in a United States 
District Court. A has exhausted the administrative

[[Page 434]]

remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except A first 
requests an Appeals office conference after A's receipt of the notice of 
proposed disallowance. A is granted an Appeals office conference and A 
participates in such conference. A has exhausted the administrative 
remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.
    Example 4. Taxpayer B receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter) after completion of a field examination. B provided to the 
Internal Revenue Service during the examination all relevant information 
under the taxpayer's control and all relevant legal arguments supporting 
the taxpayer's position. B properly requests an Appeals office 
conference. The Appeals office, to obtain an additional period of time 
to consider the tax matter, requests that B sign Form 872 to extend the 
time for an assessment of tax, but B declines. Appeals then denies the 
request for a conference and issues a notice of deficiency. B has 
exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal 
Revenue Service.
    Example 5. Taxpayer C receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter) and a written statement that C need not file a written 
protest or request an Appeals office conference since a conference will 
not be granted. C files a petition in the Tax Court after receiving the 
statutory notice of deficiency. C's administrative remedies within the 
Internal Revenue Service are deemed to have been exhausted.
    Example 6. On January 2, the Internal Revenue Service serves a 
summons issued under section 7609 on third-party recordkeeper D to 
produce records of taxpayer E. On January 5, notice of the summons is 
given to E. The last day on which E may file a petition in a court of 
the United States to quash the summons is January 25. Thereafter, E 
files a written claim for relief with the district director having 
jurisdiction over the matter together with a copy of the summons. The 
claim and copy are received by the district director on January 20. On 
January 25, E files a petition to quash the summons. E has exhausted the 
administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.
    Example 7. A notice of Federal tax lien is filed in County M on 
March 3, in the name of F. On April 2, F pays the entire liability 
thereby satisfying the lien. On May 2, F files a written claim with the 
district director having jurisdiction over the tax matter demanding a 
certificate of release of lien. Thereafter, F provides the district 
director with a copy of the notice of Federal tax lien and a copy of the 
canceled check in satisfaction of the lien, which are received by the 
district director on May 15. F's claim is deemed to have been filed on 
May 15. Accordingly, F must wait until after July 14 (60 days following 
the filing of the claim for relief on May 15) to commence an action, in 
order to have exhausted the administrative remedies available within the 
Internal Revenue Service.
    Example 8. A revenue officer seizes an automobile to effect 
collection of G's liability on January 10. On January 22, H submits a 
written claim to the district director having jurisdiction over the tax 
matter claiming that H purchased the automobile from G for an adequate 
consideration before the tax lien against G arose, and demands immediate 
return of the automobile. A copy of the title certificate and H's 
canceled check are submitted with the claim. The claim is received by 
the district director on January 25. On January 30, H brings a wrongful 
levy action. H has exhausted the administrative remedies available 
within the Internal Revenue Service.
    Example 9. The Internal Revenue Service issues a revenue ruling 
which holds that ear piercing does not affect a function or structure of 
the body within the meaning of section 213 and therefore is not 
deductible. Taxpayer I deducts the costs of ear piercing and, following 
an examination, receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter) 
disallowing the treatment of such costs. Because of the revenue ruling, 
I believes a conference would not aid in the resolution of the tax 
dispute. Accordingly, I does not request an Appeals office conference. 
After receiving a statutory notice of deficiency, I files a petition in 
the Tax Court. I has not exhausted the administrative remedies available 
within the Internal Revenue Service. The issuance of a revenue ruling 
covering the same fact situation but taking a contrary position does not 
constitute notification by the Internal Revenue Service to I that the 
pursuit of administrative remedies is unnecessary. Similarly, the 
issuance to I of a private letter ruling or technical advice does not 
constitute notification by the Internal Revenue Service that the pursuit 
of administrative remedies is unnecessary.
    Example 10. Taxpayer J is assessed a penalty under section 6701 for 
aiding in the understatement of the tax liability of another person. J 
pays 15% of the penalty in accordance with section 6703 and files a 
claim for refund on June 15. J is not issued a notice of proposed 
disallowance and thus cannot participate in an Appeals office conference 
within six months of the filing of the claim for refund. J brings an 
action on December 23. J has exhausted the administrative remedies 
available within the Internal Revenue Service.
    Example 11. Taxpayer K receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter) and neither requests nor participates in an Appeals office 
conference. The Service then issues a statutory notice of deficiency 
(90-day letter). Upon receiving the statutory notice, and

[[Page 435]]

after filing a petition with the Tax Court, K requests an Appeals office 
conference. K has not exhausted the administrative remedies available 
within the Internal Revenue Service because the request for an Appeals 
office conference was made after the issuance of the statutory notice.

    (g) Effective date. This section applies to court proceedings 
described in section 7430 filed in a court of the United States 
(including the Tax Court) after May 7, 1992.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7430-2  Requirements and procedures for recovery of reasonable administrative costs.

    (a) Introduction. Section 7430(a)(1) provides for the recovery, 
under certain circumstances, of reasonable administrative costs incurred 
in connection with an administrative proceeding before the Internal 
Revenue Service. Paragraph (b) of this section lists the requirements 
that a taxpayer must meet to be entitled to an award of reasonable 
administrative costs.
    (b) Requirements for recovery--(1) Determination by the Internal 
Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service will grant a taxpayer's 
request for recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred in 
connection with an administrative proceeding under section 7430 and this 
section only if--
    (i) Jurisdiction. The underlying substantive issues or the issue of 
reasonable administrative costs are not, and have never been, before any 
court of the United States (including the Tax Court or United States 
Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction over those issues;
    (ii) Administrative proceeding. The costs were incurred in 
connection with an administrative proceeding as defined in 
Sec. 301.7430-3(a);
    (iii) Administrative proceeding date. The costs were incurred on or 
after the administrative proceeding date as defined in Sec. 301.7430-
3(c);
    (iv) Reasonable administrative costs. The costs were reasonable 
administrative costs as defined in Sec. 301.7430-4;
    (v) Prevailing party. The taxpayer is a prevailing party as defined 
in Sec. 301.7430-5;
    (vi) Not unreasonably protracted. The administrative proceeding was 
not unreasonably protracted by the taxpayer as discussed in paragraph 
(d) of this section; and
    (vii) Procedural requirements. The taxpayer follows the procedures 
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Determination by court. Although the Internal Revenue Service 
will not grant a request for reasonable administrative costs where the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, a 
taxpayer may file a claim for reasonable administrative costs with the 
court with jurisdiction over the judicial proceeding. The court may 
award the taxpayer reasonable administrative costs under section 
7430(a). Under section 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii), where the final determination 
with respect to the tax, interest, or penalty at issue is made by a 
court, the court determines whether the taxpayer qualifies as a 
prevailing party. Thus, where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section are not met, the taxpayer's only possibility of obtaining 
an award of reasonable administrative costs is to obtain an award of 
such costs from the court. In the event the court awards reasonable 
administrative costs, it may also award litigation costs for the 
reasonable costs of pursuing the claim for reasonable administrative 
costs, provided the requirements under section 7430 regarding an award 
of reasonable administrative costs are satisfied with respect to such 
costs. A claim filed with the court should be made in accordance with 
the rules of the court.
    (c) Procedure for recovering reasonable administrative costs--(1) In 
general. The Internal Revenue Service will not award administrative 
costs under section 7430 unless the taxpayer files a written request to 
recover reasonable administrative costs in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (2) Where request must be filed. A request required by paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service 
personnel who have jurisdiction over the tax matter underlying the claim 
for the costs. However, if those persons are unknown to the taxpayer 
making the request, the taxpayer may send the request to the District 
Director for the district that considered the underlying matter.

[[Page 436]]

    (3) Contents of request. The request must be in writing and must 
contain the following statements, affidavits, documentation, and 
information with regard to the taxpayer's administrative proceeding:
    (i) Statements. (A) A statement that the underlying substantive 
issues or the issue of reasonable administrative costs are not, and have 
never been, before any court of the United States (including the Tax 
Court or United States Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction over 
those issues;
    (B) A clear and concise statement of the reasons why the taxpayer 
alleges that the position of the Internal Revenue Service in the 
administrative proceeding was not substantially justified;
    (C) A statement sufficient to demonstrate that the taxpayer has 
substantially prevailed as to the amount in controversy or with respect 
to the most significant issue or set of issues presented in the 
proceeding;
    (D) A statement that the taxpayer has not unreasonably protracted 
the portion of the administrative proceeding for which the taxpayer is 
requesting costs; and
    (E) A statement supported by a detailed affidavit executed by the 
taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative that sets forth the nature and 
amount of each specific item of reasonable administrative costs for 
which the taxpayer is seeking recovery.
    (ii) Affidavit or affidavits. (A) An affidavit executed by the 
taxpayer stating that the taxpayer meets the net worth and size 
limitations of Sec. 301.7430-5(f);
    (B) An affidavit supporting the statement described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(E) of this section; and
    (C) If more than $75 per hour, as adjusted by an increase in the 
cost of living as set forth in Sec. 301.7430-4(b)(3), is claimed for the 
fees of a representative in connection with the administrative 
proceeding, then an affidavit that specialized skills and distinctive 
knowledge as described in that section were necessary in the 
representation of the taxpayer in the proceeding and that there is a 
limited availability of representatives possessing such skills and 
knowledge as described in that section, or an affidavit that another 
special factor is applicable.
    (iii) Documentation and information. (A) A copy of the billing 
records of the representative for the requested fees; and
    (B) An address at which the taxpayer wishes to receive notice of the 
determination of the Internal Revenue Service with regard to the request 
for reasonable administrative costs.
    (4) Form of Request. No specific form is required for the request 
other than one which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. Where practicable the required statements may be included 
in a single document. Similarly, where practicable, the required 
affidavits may be combined in a single affidavit to the extent they are 
to be executed by the same person.
    (5) Period for requesting costs from the Internal Revenue Service. 
To recover reasonable administrative costs pursuant to section 7430 and 
this section, the taxpayer must file a request for costs no later than 
90 days after the date the final decision of the Internal Revenue 
Service with respect to all tax, additions to tax and penalties at issue 
in the administrative proceeding is mailed, or otherwise furnished, to 
the taxpayer. The final decision of the Internal Revenue Service for 
purposes of this section is the document which resolves the tax 
liability of the taxpayer with regard to all tax, additions to tax and 
penalties at issue in the administrative proceeding (such as a Form 870 
or closing agreement), or a notice of assessment for that liability 
(such as the notice and demand under section 6303), whichever is earlier 
mailed, or otherwise furnished, to the taxpayer. For purposes of this 
section, if the 90th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal 
holiday, the 90-day period shall end on the next succeeding day which is 
not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. The term legal holiday means 
a legal holiday in the District of Columbia. If the request for costs is 
to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at an office of the 
Internal Revenue Service located outside the District of Columbia but 
within an internal revenue district, the term legal holiday also means a 
Statewide legal holiday in the State where such office is located.

[[Page 437]]

    (6) Notice. The Internal Revenue Service is authorized, but not 
required, to notify the taxpayer of its decision to grant or deny (in 
whole or in part) an award for reasonable administrative costs under 
section 7430 and this section by certified mail or registered mail. If 
the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to a request 
by the taxpayer for an award of reasonable administrative costs filed 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 6 months after such 
request is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond may 
be considered by the taxpayer as a decision of the Internal Revenue 
Service denying an award for reasonable administrative costs.
    (7) Appeal to Tax Court. A taxpayer may appeal a decision by the 
Internal Revenue Service denying (in whole or in part) a request for 
reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by 
filing a petition for reasonable administrative costs with the Tax 
Court. The petition must be in accordance with the Tax Court's Rules of 
Practice and Procedure and must be filed with the Tax Court after the 
Internal Revenue Service denies (in whole or in part) the taxpayer's 
request for reasonable administrative costs.
    (d) Unreasonable protraction of administrative proceeding. An award 
of reasonable administrative costs will not be made where the taxpayer 
unreasonably protracted the administrative proceeding. However, a 
taxpayer that unreasonably protracted only a portion of the 
administrative proceeding, but not other portions of the administrative 
proceeding, may recover reasonable administrative costs for the 
portion(s) of the administrative proceeding that the taxpayer did not 
unreasonably protract, if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section are otherwise satisfied.
    (e) Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter). A requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. 
Appeals requests that A submit certain documents as substantiation for 
the tax matters at issue. Although A complies with this request, the 
information is misdirected and not considered by Appeals. Appeals then 
issues a notice of deficiency. A does not file a petition with the Tax 
Court. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A convinces Appeals 
that the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. 
Appeals then closes the case showing a zero deficiency and mails A a 
notice to this effect. Assuming that the other requirements of this 
section are satisfied, A may recover reasonable administrative costs 
incurred after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative 
proceeding date). To recover these costs, A must file a request for 
costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled A's tax matter, or 
if that person is unknown to A, with the District Director of the 
district which considered the underlying matter, within 90 days after 
the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that A owes 
no tax.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that after 
receipt of the notice of deficiency, A meets with an Appeals officer, 
but no agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. A then files a 
petition with the Tax Court and prevails. Since the underlying tax 
issues have been determined by a court, the Internal Revenue Service 
will not grant a request for recovery of the reasonable administrative 
costs incurred by A. To recover reasonable administrative costs, A must 
file a claim with the Tax Court as prescribed under the Tax Court's 
Rules of Practice and Procedure.

Sec. 301.7430-3  Administrative proceeding and administrative proceeding date.

    (a) Administrative proceeding. For purposes of section 7430, an 
administrative proceeding generally means any procedure or other action 
before the Internal Revenue Service that is commenced after November 10, 
1988. However, an administrative proceeding does not include--
    (1) Proceedings involving matters of general application, including 
hearings on regulations, comments on forms, or proceedings involving 
revenue rulings or revenue procedures;
    (2) Proceedings involving requests for private letter rulings or 
similar determinations;
    (3) Proceedings involving technical advice memoranda, except those 
submitted after the administrative proceeding date (as defined in 
paragraph (c) of this section); and

[[Page 438]]

    (4) Proceedings in connection with collection actions (as defined in 
paragraph (b) of this section), including proceedings under sections 
7432 or 7433.
    (b) Collection action. A collection action generally includes any 
action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect a tax (or any 
interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with 
any costs in addition to the tax) or any action taken by a taxpayer in 
response to the Internal Revenue Service's act or failure to act in 
connection with the collection of a tax (including any interest, 
additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs 
in addition to the tax). For example, a collection action for purposes 
of section 7430 and this section includes any action taken by the 
Internal Revenue Service under Chapter 64 of Subtitle F to collect a 
tax. Collection actions also include those actions taken by a taxpayer 
to remedy the Internal Revenue Service's failure to release a lien under 
section 6325 and to remedy any unauthorized collection action as defined 
by section 7433. However, an action or procedure directly relating to a 
claim for refund filed with the Service Center's Collection Branch or 
District Director's Collection Division after payment of an assessed tax 
is not a collection action.
    (c) Administrative proceeding date--(1) General rule. For purposes 
of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, the term administrative 
proceeding date means the earlier of--
    (i) The date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the 
decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals; or
    (ii) The date of the notice of deficiency.
    (2) Notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of 
Appeals. For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, a 
notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals 
is the final written document, mailed or delivered to the taxpayer, that 
is signed by an individual in the Office of Appeals who has been 
delegated the authority to settle the dispute on behalf of the 
Commissioner, and states or indicates that the notice is the final 
determination of the entire case. A notice of claim disallowance issued 
by the Office of Appeals is a notice of the decision of the Internal 
Revenue Service Office of Appeals. Solely for purposes of determining 
the administrative proceeding date, a notice of deficiency issued by the 
Office of Appeals is not a notice of the decision of the Internal 
Revenue Service Office of Appeals.
    (3) Notice of deficiency. A notice of deficiency is a notice 
described in section 6212(a), including a notice rescinded pursuant to 
section 6212(d). For purposes of determining reasonable administrative 
costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, a notice of 
final partnership administrative adjustment described in section 
6223(a)(2) will be treated as a notice of deficiency. A notice of final 
S corporation administrative adjustment issued pursuant to section 
6223(a)(2) as made applicable to subchapter S items by section 6244 will 
also be treated as a notice of deficiency.
    (d) Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals office 
conference. At the conference, an agreement is reached on the tax 
matters at issue. A cannot recover any costs because they were not 
incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date, which is the 
earlier of the date of receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the 
decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, or the date 
of the notice of deficiency.
    Example 2. Taxpayer B receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter). B pays the amount of the proposed deficiency and files a 
claim for refund. B's claim is disallowed and a notice of proposed 
disallowance is issued by the District Director. B does not request an 
Appeals office conference and the District Director issues a notice of 
claim disallowance. B then files suit in a United States District Court. 
B cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because, although the 
District Director issued a notice of claim disallowance, the Internal 
Revenue Service did not issue either a notice of decision of the 
Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals or a notice of deficiency.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that after 
B files a claim for refund and receives the notice of proposed 
disallowance, B requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. No 
agreement is reached with Appeals and the Office of Appeals issues a 
notice of claim disallowance. B

[[Page 439]]

does not file suit in District Court but instead contacts the Appeals 
office to attempt to reverse the decision. B convinces the Appeals 
officer that the notice of claim disallowance is in error. The Appeals 
officer then abates the assessment. Because a notice of claim 
disallowance issued by Appeals is a notice of the decision of the 
Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, B may recover reasonable 
administrative costs incurred on or after the receipt of the notice of 
claim disallowance (the administrative proceeding date), but only if the 
other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are 
satisfied. B cannot recover the costs incurred prior to receipt of the 
notice of claim disallowance because they were incurred before the 
administrative proceeding date.
    Example 4. Taxpayer C receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter). C files a request for and is granted an Appeals office 
conference. At the Appeals conference no agreement is reached on the tax 
matters at issue. The Office of Appeals then issues a notice of 
deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency C does not file a 
petition with the Tax Court. Instead, C pays the deficiency and files a 
claim for refund. The claim for refund is considered by the Internal 
Revenue Service and the District Director issues a notice of proposed 
disallowance. C requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. C 
convinces Appeals that C's claim is correct and Appeals allows C's 
claim. C may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or 
after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative 
proceeding date), but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and 
the regulations thereunder are satisfied.
    Example 5. Taxpayer D receives a District Director's Collection 
Division (Collection) proposed assessment of trust fund taxes (Trust 
Fund Recovery Penalty) pursuant to section 6672. D requests and is 
granted Appeals office consideration. Upon consideration, Appeals 
upholds D's position. D cannot recover reasonable administrative costs 
because the costs were not incurred on or after the administrative 
proceeding date.
    Example 6. Taxpayer E files an individual income tax return showing 
a balance due. No payment is made with the return and the Internal 
Revenue Service assesses the amount shown on the return. The Internal 
Revenue Service issues a notice and demand for tax pursuant to section 
6303. E contacts the Collection Division (Collection) regarding E's 
outstanding liability. No agreement is reached with respect to the 
timing of E's payment, and Collection issues a notice of intent to levy 
pursuant to section 6331(d). Prior to the levy, E enters into an 
installment agreement with Collection. The costs that E incurred in 
connection with the notice and demand were not incurred in an 
administrative proceeding, but rather in a collection action. 
Accordingly, E may not recover those costs as reasonable administrative 
costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder.
    Example 7. Taxpayer F receives a District Director's Collection 
Division (Collection) proposed assessment of trust fund taxes (Trust 
Fund Recovery Penalty) pursuant to section 6672. F requests and is 
granted Appeals office consideration. Appeals considers the issues and 
decides to uphold Collection's recommended assessment. Appeals notifies 
F of this decision in writing. Collection then assesses the tax. 
Pursuant to section 6672(b), within 30 days after the notice and demand 
is made, F pays the minimum amount required to commence a court 
proceeding, files a claim for refund, and furnishes the required bond. 
Collection then considers and disallows the claim. Appeals then 
reconsiders the claim and reverses its original position, thus upholding 
F's position. Appeals then abates the assessment. F may recover 
reasonable administrative costs incurred after the receipt of the 
original decision of Appeals (the administrative proceeding date) that 
Appeals was upholding Collection's recommended assessment, but only if 
the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder 
are satisfied. F cannot recover costs that are attributable to any 
procedure or other action before Collection prior to filing F's 
administrative claim for refund.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7430-4  Reasonable administrative costs.

    (a) In general. For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations 
thereunder, reasonable administrative costs are any costs described in 
paragraph (b) of this section that are incurred in connection with an 
administrative proceeding (as defined in Sec. 301.7430-3(a)) and 
incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date (as defined in 
Sec. 301.7430-3(c)).
    (b) Costs described--(1) In general. The costs described in this 
paragraph are the reasonable and necessary amount of costs incurred by 
the taxpayer to present the taxpayer's position with respect to the 
merits of the tax controversy or the recovery of reasonable 
administrative costs. These costs include--
    (i) Any administrative fees or similar charges imposed by the 
Internal Revenue Service;
    (ii) Reasonable expenses of expert witnesses;
    (iii) Reasonable costs of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test or

[[Page 440]]

project that is necessary for, and incurred in preparation of, the 
taxpayer's case; and
    (iv) Reasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of a 
representative (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) in 
connection with the administrative proceeding.
    (2) Representative and specially qualified representative--(i) 
Representative. A representative is a person compensated for services 
rendered in connection with the administrative proceeding, who is 
authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service or the Tax 
Court.
    (ii) Specially qualified representative. For purposes of paragraphs 
(b)(3)(iii) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a specially qualified 
representative is a representative (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section) possessing a distinctive knowledge or a unique and 
specialized skill that is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer 
in the proceeding. Examples of a unique and specialized skill or 
distinctive knowledge would be an identifiable practice specialty such 
as patent law or knowledge of a foreign law or language where such 
specialty or knowledge is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer 
in the proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, neither knowledge of 
tax law nor experience in representing taxpayers before the Internal 
Revenue Service is considered distinctive knowledge or a unique and 
specialized skill. An extraordinary level of general representational 
knowledge and ability that is useful in all proceedings is not 
considered, in and of itself, distinctive knowledge or a unique and 
specialized skill. Specially qualified representatives also do not 
include those who have a distinctive knowledge of the underlying subject 
matter of the controversy in circumstances where such distinctive 
knowledge could reasonably be supplied through the use of an expert, or 
could readily be obtained through literature pertaining to the subject.
    (3) Limitation on fees for a representative--(i) In general. Except 
as otherwise provided in this section, fees described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iv) of this section that are recoverable under section 7430 and 
the regulations thereunder as reasonable administrative costs may not 
exceed $75 per hour increased by a cost of living adjustment (and if 
appropriate, a special factor adjustment).
    (ii) Cost of living adjustment--(A) In general. The Internal Revenue 
Service will make a cost of living adjustment to the $75 per hour limit 
by using the Consumer Price Index of All-Urban Consumers (CPI-U) 
published by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics and 
referenced in Internal Revenue Code section 1(f)(5). If the CPI-U is no 
longer published, a comparable index will be used, and any reference in 
this section to the CPI-U will be considered to refer to such comparable 
index.
    (B) Percentage adjustment. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) 
of this section, the base year for determining the cost of living 
adjustment is the calendar year 1986. The cost of living adjustment for 
fees incurred in any calendar year subsequent to 1986 is the percentage 
(if any) by which the yearly average CPI-U for the calendar year 
immediately prior to the year in which the fees are incurred exceeds the 
January CPI-U for the calendar year 1986.
    (iii) Special factor adjustment--(A) In general. If the presence of 
a special factor is demonstrated by the taxpayer, the amount 
reimbursable is the amount of reasonable fees paid or incurred by the 
taxpayer in connection with the proceeding for the services of a 
representative as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (B) Special factor. A special factor is a factor, other than an 
increase in the cost of living, which justifies an increase in the $75 
per hour limitation of section 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii). The novelty and 
difficulty of the issues, the undesirability of the case, the work and 
the ability of counsel, the results obtained, and customary fees and 
awards in other cases, are factors applicable to a broad spectrum of 
litigation and do not constitute special factors for the purpose of 
increasing the $75 per hour limitation. The limited availability of a 
specially qualified representative for the proceeding does constitute a 
special factor justifying an increase in the $75 per hour limitation.
    (C) Limited availability. Unless disputed by the Internal Revenue 
Service,

[[Page 441]]

limited availability of a specially qualified representative is 
established by demonstrating that a specially qualified representative 
for the proceeding is not available at the $75 per hour rate (as 
adjusted for an increase in the cost of living). Initially, this showing 
may be made by submission of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by 
the taxpayer's counsel, that in a case similar to the taxpayer's, a 
specially qualified representative that practices within a reasonable 
distance from the taxpayer's principal residence or principal office 
would normally charge a client similar to the taxpayer at a rate in 
excess of this amount. If the Internal Revenue Service challenges this 
initial showing, the taxpayer may submit additional evidence to 
establish the limited availability of a specially qualified 
representative at the rate specified above.
    (D) Example. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. Taxpayer A is represented by B, a CPA and attorney with an 
LL.M. Degree in Taxation with Highest Honors and who regularly handles 
cases dealing with TEFRA partnership issues. B represents A in an 
administrative proceeding involving TEFRA partnership issues and subject 
to the provisions of this section. Assuming the taxpayer qualifies for 
an award of reasonable administrative costs by meeting the requirements 
of section 7430, the amount of the award attributable to the fees of B 
may not exceed the $75 per hour limitation (as adjusted for the cost of 
living), absent a special factor. Under these facts alone, B is not a 
specially qualified representative since even extraordinary knowledge of 
the tax laws does not constitute distinctive knowledge or a unique and 
specialized skill constituting a special factor.

    (c) Certain costs excluded--(1) Costs not incurred in an 
administrative proceeding. Costs that are not reasonable administrative 
costs for purposes of section 7430 include any costs incurred in 
connection with a proceeding that is not an administrative proceeding 
within the meaning of Sec. 301.7430-3.
    (2) Costs incurred in an administrative proceeding but not 
reasonable--(i) In general. Costs incurred in an administrative 
proceeding that are incurred on or after the administrative proceeding 
date, and that are otherwise described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
are not recoverable unless they are reasonable in both nature and 
amount. For example, costs normally included in the hourly rate of the 
representative by the custom and usage of the representative's 
profession, when billed separately, are not recoverable separate and 
apart from the representative's hourly rate. Such costs typically 
include costs such as secretarial and overhead expenses. In contrast, 
costs which are normally billed separately may be reasonable 
administrative costs that may be recoverable in addition to the 
representative's hourly rate. Therefore, necessary costs incurred for 
travel; expedited mail delivery; messenger service; expenses while on 
travel; long distance telephone calls; and necessary copying fees 
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, any court, bank or other third 
party, when normally billed separately from the representative's hourly 
rate, may be reasonable administrative costs.
    (ii) Special Rule for Expert Witness' Fees on Issue of Prevailing 
Market Rates. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the 
taxpayer may initially establish a limited availability of specially 
qualified representatives for the proceeding by submission of an 
affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by the taxpayer's representative. 
The Internal Revenue Service may endeavor to rebut the affidavit 
submitted on this issue by demonstrating either that a specially 
qualified representative was not necessary to represent the taxpayer in 
the proceeding, that the taxpayer's representative is not a specially 
qualified representative or that the prevailing rate for specially 
qualified representatives does not exceed $75 per hour (as adjusted for 
an increase in the cost of living). Unless the Internal Revenue Service 
endeavors to demonstrate that the prevailing rate for specially 
qualified representatives does not exceed $75 per hour (as adjusted for 
an increase in the cost of living), fees for expert witnesses used to 
establish prevailing market rates are not included in the term 
reasonable administrative costs.
    (3) Litigation costs. Litigation costs are not reasonable 
administrative costs

[[Page 442]]

because they are not incurred in connection with an administrative 
proceeding. Litigation costs include--
    (i) Costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of 
a petition with the United States Tax Court or in connection with the 
commencement of any other court proceeding; and
    (ii) Costs incurred after the filing of a petition with the United 
States Tax Court or after the commencement of any other court 
proceeding.
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-
day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals office 
conference. At the conference no agreement is reached on the tax matters 
at issue. The Internal Revenue Service then issues a notice of 
deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency, A discontinues A's 
administrative efforts and files a petition with the Tax Court. A's 
costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of a 
petition with the Tax Court are litigation costs and not reasonable 
administrative costs. Furthermore, A's costs incurred before the 
administrative proceeding date (date of the notice of deficiency as set 
forth in Sec. 301.7430-3(c)(3)), are not reasonable administrative 
costs.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that after A 
receives the notice of deficiency, A recontacts Appeals. Again, A's 
costs incurred before the administrative proceeding date, the date of 
the notice of deficiency as set forth in Sec. 301.7430-3(c)(3), are not 
reasonable administrative costs. A's costs incurred in recontacting and 
working with Appeals after the issuance of the notice of deficiency, and 
up to and including the time of filing of the petition, are reasonable 
administrative costs. A's costs incurred in connection with the filing 
of a petition with the Tax Court are not reasonable administrative costs 
because those costs are litigation costs. Similarly, A's costs incurred 
after the filing of the petition are not reasonable administrative 
costs, as those are litigation costs.

[T.D. 8542, 59 FR 29363, June 7, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7430-5  Prevailing party.

    (a) In general. For purposes of an award of reasonable 
administrative costs under section 7430, a taxpayer is a prevailing 
party only if the taxpayer--
    (1) Establishes that the position of the Internal Revenue Service 
was not substantially justified;
    (2) Substantially prevails as to the amount in controversy or with 
respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented; and
    (3) Satisfies the net worth and size limitations referenced in 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Position of the Internal Revenue Service. The position of the 
Internal Revenue Service in an administrative proceeding is the position 
taken by the Internal Revenue Service as of the administrative 
proceeding date (as defined in Sec. 301.7430-3(c)) or any date 
thereafter.
    (c) Substantially justified--(1) In general. The position of the 
Internal Revenue Service is substantially justified if it has a 
reasonable basis in both fact and law. A significant factor in 
determining whether the position of the Internal Revenue Service is 
substantially justified as of a given date is whether, on or before that 
date, the taxpayer has presented all relevant information under the 
taxpayer's control and relevant legal arguments supporting the 
taxpayer's position to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service 
personnel. The appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel are 
personnel responsible for reviewing the information or arguments, or 
personnel who would transfer the information or arguments in the normal 
course of procedure and administration to the personnel who are 
responsible.
    (2) Exception. If the position of the Internal Revenue Service was 
substantially justified with respect to some issues in the proceeding 
and not substantially justified with respect to the remaining issues, 
any award of reasonable administrative costs to the taxpayer may be 
limited to only reasonable administrative costs attributable to those 
issues with respect to which the position of the Internal Revenue 
Service was not substantially justified. If the position of the Internal 
Revenue Service was substantially justified for only a portion of the 
period of the proceeding and not substantially justified for the 
remaining portion of the proceeding, any award of reasonable 
administrative costs to the taxpayer may be limited to only reasonable 
administrative costs attributable to that portion during which the 
position of the

[[Page 443]]

Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified. Where an award 
of reasonable administrative costs is limited to that portion of the 
administrative proceeding during which the position of the Internal 
Revenue Service was not substantially justified, whether the position of 
the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified is determined 
as of the date any cost is incurred.
    (d) Amount in controversy. The amount in controversy shall include 
the amount in issue as of the administrative proceeding date as 
increased by any amounts subsequently placed in issue by any party. The 
amount in controversy is determined without increasing or reducing the 
amount in controversy for amounts of loss, deduction, or credit carried 
over from years not in issue.
    (e) Most significant issue or set of issues presented. Where the 
taxpayer has not substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in 
controversy the taxpayer may nonetheless be a prevailing party if the 
taxpayer substantially prevails with respect to the most significant 
issue or set of issues presented. The issues presented include those 
raised as of the administrative proceeding date and those raised 
subsequently. Only in a multiple issue proceeding can a most significant 
issue or set of issues presented exist. However, not all multiple issue 
proceedings contain a most significant issue or set of issues presented. 
An issue or set of issues constitutes the most significant issue or set 
of issues presented if, despite involving a lesser dollar amount in the 
proceeding than the other issue or issues, it objectively represents the 
most significant issue or set of issues for the taxpayer or the Internal 
Revenue Service. This may occur because of the effect of the issue or 
set of issues on other transactions or other taxable years of the 
taxpayer or related parties.
    (f) Net worth and size limitations--(1) Individuals and estates. An 
individual taxpayer or an estate meets the net worth and size 
limitations of this paragraph if, on the administrative proceeding date, 
the taxpayer's net worth does not exceed two million dollars. For this 
purpose, individuals filing a joint return shall be treated as 1 
taxpayer, except in the case of a spouse relieved of liability under 
section 6013(e).
    (2) Others. A taxpayer that is an owner of an unincorporated 
business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or organization (other than an organization described in 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section) meets the net worth and size 
limitations of this paragraph if, as of the administrative proceeding 
date--
    (i) The taxpayer's net worth does not exceed seven million dollars; 
and
    (ii) The taxpayer does not have more than 500 employees.
    (3) Special rule for charitable organizations and certain 
cooperatives. An organization described in Internal Revenue Code section 
501(c)(3) exempt from taxation under Internal Revenue Code section 
501(a), or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a) (as in effect on October 
22, 1986), meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph 
if, as of the administrative proceeding date, the organization or 
cooperative association does not have more than 500 employees.
    (g) Determination of prevailing party. If the final decision with 
respect to the tax, interest, or penalty is made at the administrative 
level, the determination of whether a taxpayer is a prevailing party 
shall be made by agreement of the parties, or absent such agreement, by 
the Internal Revenue Service. See Sec. 301.7430-2(c)(7) regarding the 
right to appeal the decision of the Internal Revenue Service denying (in 
whole or in part) a request for reasonable administrative costs to the 
Tax Court.
    (h) Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. The Internal Revenue Service, in the conduct of a 
correspondence examination of taxpayer A's individual income tax return, 
requests substantiation from A of claimed medical expenses. A does not 
respond to the request and the Service Center issues a notice of 
deficiency. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A presents 
sufficient information and arguments to convince a revenue agent that 
the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. The 
revenue agent then closes the case showing no deficiency. Although A 
incurred costs after the issuance of the notice of deficiency, A is

[[Page 444]]

unable to recover these costs because, as of the date these costs were 
incurred, A had not presented relevant information under A's control and 
relevant legal arguments supporting A's position to the appropriate 
Internal Revenue Service personnel. Accordingly, the position of the 
Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified at the time the 
costs were incurred.
    Example 2. In the purchase of an ongoing business, taxpayer B 
obtains from the previous owner of the business a covenant not to 
compete for a period of five years. On audit of B's individual income 
tax return for the year in which the business is acquired, the Internal 
Revenue Service challenges the basis assigned to the covenant not to 
compete and a deduction taken as a business expense for a seminar 
attended by B. Both parties agree that the covenant not to compete is 
amortizable over a period of five years. However, the Internal Revenue 
Service asserts that the proper basis of the covenant is $2X while the 
taxpayer asserts the basis is $4X. Thus, under the Internal Revenue 
Service's position, B is entitled to a deduction of two-fifths $X in the 
year under audit and for each of the subsequent four years. B's 
position, however, would result in a deduction of four-fifths $X for the 
year under audit and each of the subsequent four years. The deduction 
for the seminar attended by B was reported on the return in question in 
the amount of $X. The Internal Revenue Service's position is that the 
deduction for the seminar should be disallowed entirely. In the notice 
of deficiency, the Internal Revenue Service determines adjustments of 
two-fifths $X (the difference between the Internal Revenue Service's 
position of two-fifths $X and the reported four-fifths $X) regarding the 
basis of the covenant not to compete, and $X resulting from the 
disallowance of the seminar expense. Thus, of the two adjustments 
determined for the year under audit, that attributable to the 
disallowance of the seminar is larger than that attributable to the 
covenant not to compete. However, due to the impact on the next 
succeeding four years, the covenant not to compete adjustment is 
objectively the most significant issue to both B and the Internal 
Revenue Service.
    Example 3. The Collection Branch of a Service Center of the Internal 
Revenue Service determines in the matching process of various Forms 1099 
and W-2 that taxpayer C has not filed an individual income tax return. 
The Internal Revenue Service sends notices to C requesting that C file 
an income tax return. C does not file a return, so the Service Center's 
Collection Branch prepares a substitute for return pursuant to section 
6020(b). The calculation is sent to C requesting that C either sign the 
return pursuant to section 6020(a) or file a tax return prepared by C. C 
does not respond to the Internal Revenue Service's request and the 
Service Center's Collection Branch issues a notice of deficiency based 
on information in its possession. C does not file a petition with the 
Tax Court and does not pay the asserted deficiency. The Internal Revenue 
Service then assesses the tax shown on the notice of deficiency and 
issues a notice and demand for tax pursuant to section 6303. After 
receiving notice and demand, C contacts the Collection Branch and 
convinces Collection to stay the collection process because C does not 
owe any taxes. The Collection Branch recommends that the Examination 
Division examine the tax liability and make an adjustment to income. The 
Examination Division then redetermines the tax and abates the assessment 
due to information and arguments presented by C at that time. The costs 
C incurred before the Collection Branch are incurred in connection with 
an action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect a tax. 
Therefore, these costs are incurred with respect to a collection action 
and not an administrative proceeding. Accordingly, they are not 
recoverable as reasonable administrative costs. Costs incurred before 
the Examination Division are reasonable administrative costs; however, C 
may not recover any reasonable administrative costs with respect to the 
proceeding before the Examination Division because, as of the date the 
costs were incurred, C had not previously presented all relevant 
information under C's control and all relevant legal arguments 
supporting C's position to the Collection Branch or Examination Division 
personnel (the appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel under 
Sec. 301.7430-5(c)), and thus, the position of the Internal Revenue 
Service was substantially justified based upon the information it had.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7432-1  Civil cause of action for failure to release a lien.

    (a) In general. If any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue 
Service knowingly, or by reason of negligence, fails to release a lien 
on property of the taxpayer in accordance with section

[[Page 445]]

6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, such taxpayer may bring a civil 
action for damages against the United States in federal district court. 
The total amount of damages recoverable is the sum of:
    (1) The actual, direct economic damages sustained by the taxpayer 
which, but for the officer's or the employee's knowing or negligent 
failure to release the lien under section 6325, would not have been 
sustained; and
    (2) Costs of the action.

The amount of actual, direct economic damages that are recoverable is 
reduced to the extent such damages reasonably could have been mitigated 
by the plaintiff. An action for damages filed in federal district court 
may not be maintained unless the taxpayer has filed an administrative 
claim pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section and has waited the 
period required under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Finding of satisfaction or unenforceability. For purposes of 
this section, a finding under section 6325(a)(1) that the liability for 
the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, has 
been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable is treated as 
made on the earlier of:
    (1) The date on which the district director of the district in which 
the taxpayer currently resides or the district in which the lien was 
filed finds full satisfaction or legal unenforceability; or
    (2) The date on which such district director receives a request for 
a certificate of release of lien in accordance with Sec. 401.6325-1(f), 
together with any information which is reasonably necessary for the 
district director to conclude that the lien has been fully satisfied or 
is legally unenforceable.
    (c) Actual, direct economic damages--(1) Definition. Actual, direct 
economic damages are actual pecuniary damages sustained by the taxpayer 
that would not have been sustained but for an officer's or an employee's 
failure to release a lien in accordance with section 6325 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. Injuries such as inconvenience, emotional 
distress and loss of reputation are compensable only to the extent that 
they result in actual pecuniary damages.
    (2) Litigation costs and administrative costs not recoverable. 
Litigation costs and administrative costs described in this paragraph 
are not recoverable as actual, direct economic damages. Litigation costs 
may be recoverable under section 7430 (see paragraph (j) of this 
section) or, solely to the extent described in paragraph (d) of this 
section, as costs of the action.
    (i) Litigation costs. For purposes of this paragraph, litigation 
costs are any costs incurred pursuing litigation for relief from the 
failure to release a lien, including costs incurred pursuing a civil 
action in federal district court under paragraph (a) of this section. 
Litigation costs include the following:
    (A) Court costs;
    (B) Expenses of expert witnesses in connection with a court 
proceeding;
    (C) Cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or 
project prepared for a court proceeding; and
    (D) Fees paid or incurred for the services of attorneys, or other 
individuals authorized to practice before the court, in connection with 
a court proceeding.
    (ii) Administrative costs. For purposes of this section, 
administrative costs are any costs incurred pursuing administrative 
relief from the failure to release a lien, including costs incurred 
pursuing an administrative claim for damages under paragraph (f) of this 
section. The term administrative costs includes:
    (A) Any administrative fees or similar charges imposed by the 
Internal Revenue Service; and
    (B) Expenses, costs, and fees described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section incurred in pursuing administrative relief.
    (d) Costs of the action. Costs of the action recoverable as damages 
under this section are limited to the following costs:
    (1) Fees of the clerk and marshall;
    (2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the 
stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case;
    (3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;
    (4) Fees for exemplification and copies of paper necessarily 
obtained for use in the case;
    (5) Docket fees; and

[[Page 446]]

    (6) Compensation of court appointed experts and interpreters.
    (e) No civil action in federal district court prior to filing an 
administrative claim--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, no action under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
maintained in any federal district court before the earlier of the 
following dates:
    (i) The date a decision is rendered on a claim filed in accordance 
with paragraph (f) of this section; or
    (ii) The date 30 days after the date an administrative claim is 
filed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) If an administrative claim is filed in accordance with paragraph 
(f) of this section during the last 30 days of the period of limitations 
described in paragraph (i) of this section, the taxpayer may file an 
action in federal district court anytime after the administrative claim 
is filed and before the expiration of the period of limitations, without 
waiting for 30 days to expire or for a decision to be rendered on the 
claim.
    (f) Procedures for an administrative claim--(1) Manner. An 
administrative claim for actual, direct economic damages as defined in 
paragraph (c) of this section shall be sent in writing to the district 
director (marked for the attention of the Chief, Special Procedures 
Function) in the district in which the taxpayer currently resides or the 
district in which the notice of federal tax lien was filed.
    (2) Form. The administrative claim shall include:
    (i) The name, current address, current home and work telephone 
numbers and any convenient times to be contacted, and taxpayer 
identification number of the taxpayer making the claim;
    (ii) A copy of the notice of federal tax lien affecting the 
taxpayer's property, if available;
    (iii) A copy of the request for release of lien made in accordance 
with Sec. 401.6325-1(f) of the Code of Federal Regulations, if 
applicable;
    (iv) The grounds, in reasonable detail, for the claim (include 
copies of any available substantiating documentation or correspondence 
with the Internal Revenue Service);
    (v) A description of the injuries incurred by the taxpayer filing 
the claim (include copies of any available substantiating documentation 
or evidence);
    (vi) The dollar amount of the claim, including any damages that have 
not yet been incurred but that are reasonably foreseeable (include 
copies of any available substantiating documentation or evidence); and
    (vii) The signature of the taxpayer or duly authorized 
representative.
For purposes of this paragraph, a duly authorized representative is any 
attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled actuary, or any other 
person permitted to represent the taxpayer before the Internal Revenue 
Service who is not disbarred or suspended from practice before the 
Internal Revenue Service and who has a written power of attorney 
executed by the taxpayer.
    (g) Notice of failure to release lien--An administrative claim under 
paragraph (f) of this section shall be considered a notice of failure to 
release a lien.
    (h) No action in federal district court for any sum in excess of the 
dollar amount sought in the administrative claim--No action for actual, 
direct economic damages under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
instituted in federal district court for any sum in excess of the amount 
(already incurred and estimated) of the administrative claim filed under 
paragraph (f) of this section, except where the increased amount is 
based upon newly discovered evidence not reasonably discoverable at the 
time the administrative claim was filed, or upon allegation and proof of 
intervening facts relating to the amount of the claim.
    (i) Period of limitations--(1) Time of filing. A civil action under 
paragraph (a) of this section must be brought in federal district court 
within 2 years after the date the cause of action accrues.
    (2) Cause of action accrues. A cause of action accrues when the 
taxpayer has had a reasonable opportunity to discover all essential 
elements of a possible cause of action.
    (j) Recovery of costs under section 7430--Reasonable litigation 
costs, including attorney's fees, not recoverable under this section may 
be recoverable

[[Page 447]]

under section 7430. If following the Internal Revenue Service's denial 
of an administrative claim on the grounds that the Internal Revenue 
Service did not violate section 7432(a), a taxpayer brings a civil 
action for damages in a district court of the United States, and 
establishes entitlement to damages under this section, substantially 
prevails with respect to the amount of damages in controversy, and meets 
the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A)(iii) (relating to notice and 
net worth requirements), the taxpayer will be considered a ``prevailing 
party'' for purposes of section 7430. Such taxpayer, therefore, will 
generally be entitled to attorney's fees and other reasonable litigation 
costs not recoverable under this section. For purposes of the paragraph, 
if the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to an 
administrative claim for damages within 30 days after the claim is 
filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond shall be 
considered a denial of the administrative claim on the grounds that the 
Internal Revenue Service did not violate section 7432(a). Administrative 
costs, including attorney's fees incurred pursuing an administrative 
claim under paragraph (f) of this section, are not recoverable under 
section 7430.
    (k) Effective date--This section applies with respect to civil 
actions under section 7432 filed in federal district court after January 
30, 1992.

[T.D. 8393, 57 FR 3539, Jan. 30, 1992; 57 FR 6061, Feb. 19, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7433-1  Civil cause of action for certain unauthorized collection actions.

    (a) In general. If, in connection with the collection of a federal 
tax with respect to a taxpayer, an officer or an employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service recklessly or intentionally disregards any 
provision of the Internal Revenue Code or any regulation promulgated 
under the Internal Revenue Code, such taxpayer may bring a civil action 
for damages against the United States in federal district court. The 
taxpayer has a duty to mitigate damages. The total amount of damages 
recoverable is the lesser of $100,000, or the sum of:
    (1) The actual, direct economic damages sustained as a proximate 
result of the reckless or international actions of the officer or 
employee; and
    (2) Costs of the action.

An action for damages filed in federal district court may not be 
maintained unless the taxpayer has filed an administrative claim 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, and has waited for the period 
required under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Actual, direct economic damages--(1) Definition. Actual, direct 
economic damages are actual pecuniary damages sustained by the taxpayer 
as the proximate result of the reckless or intentional actions of an 
officer or an employee of the Internal Revenue Service. Injuries such as 
inconvenience, emotional distress and loss of reputation are compensable 
only to the extent that they result in actual pecuniary damages.
    (2) Litigation costs and administrative costs not recoverable. 
Litigation costs and administrative costs are not recoverable as actual, 
direct economic damages. Litigation costs may be recoverable under 
section 7430 (see paragraph (h) of this section) or, solely to the 
extent described in paragraph (c) of this section, as costs of the 
action.
    (i) Litigation costs. For purposes of this paragraph, litigation 
costs are any costs incurred pursuing litigation for relief from the 
action taken by the officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service, 
including costs incurred pursuing a civil action in federal district 
court under paragraph (a) of this section. The term litigation costs 
includes the following:
    (A) Court costs;
    (B) Expenses of expert witnesses in connection with a court 
proceeding;
    (C) Cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or 
project prepared for a court proceeding; and
    (D) Fees paid or incurred for the services of attorneys, or other 
individuals authorized to practice before the court, in connection with 
a court proceeding.
    (ii) Administrative costs. For purposes of this section, 
administrative costs are any costs incurred pursuing administrative 
relief from the action taken by an officer or employee of the Internal 
Revenue Service, including costs

[[Page 448]]

incurred pursuing an administrative claim for damages under paragraph 
(e) of this section. The term administrative costs includes:
    (A) Any administrative fees or similar charges imposed by the 
Internal Revenue Service; and
    (B) Expenses, costs, and fees described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section incurred pursuing administrative relief.
    (c) Costs of the action. Costs of the action recoverable as damages 
under this section are limited to the following costs:
    (1) Fees of the clerk and marshall;
    (2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the 
stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case;
    (3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;
    (4) Fees for exemplification and copies of paper necessarily 
obtained for use in the case;
    (5) Docket fees; and
    (6) Compensation of court appointed experts and interpreters.
    (d) No civil action in federal district court prior to filing an 
administrative claim--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, no action under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
maintained in any federal district court before the earlier of the 
following dates:
    (i) The date the decision is rendered on a claim filed in accordance 
with paragraph (e) of this section; or
    (ii) The date six months after the date an administrative claim is 
filed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) If an administrative claim is filed in accordance with paragraph 
(e) of this section during the last six months of the period of 
limitations described in paragraph (g) of this section, the taxpayer may 
file an action in federal district court any time after the 
administrative claim is filed and before the expiration of the period of 
limitations.
    (e) Procedures for an administrative claim--(1) Manner. An 
administrative claim for the lesser of $100,000 or actual, direct 
economic damages as defined in paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
sent in writing to the district director (marked for the attention of 
the Chief, Special Procedures Function) of the district in which the 
taxpayer currently resides.
    (2) Form. The administrative claim shall include:
    (i) The name, current address, current home and work telephone 
numbers and any convenient times to be contacted, and taxpayer 
identification number of the taxpayer making the claim;
    (ii) The grounds, in reasonable detail, for the claim (include 
copies of any available substantiating documentation or correspondence 
with the Internal Revenue Service);
    (iii) A description of the injuries incurred by the taxpayer filing 
the claim (include copies of any available substantiating documentation 
or evidence);
    (iv) The dollar amount of the claim, including any damages that have 
not yet been incurred but which are reasonably foreseeable (include 
copies of any available substantiating documentation or evidence); and
    (v) The signature of the taxpayer or duly authorized representative.
For purposes of this paragraph, a duly authorized representative is any 
attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled actuary, or any other 
person permitted to represent the taxpayer before the Internal Revenue 
Service who is not disbarred or suspended from practice before the 
Internal Revenue Service and who has a written power of attorney 
executed by the taxpaper.
    (f) No action in federal district court for any sum in excess of the 
dollar amount sought in the administrative claim. No action for actual, 
direct economic damages under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
instituted in federal district court for any sum in excess of the amount 
(already incurred and estimated) of the administrative claim filed under 
paragraph (e) of this section, except where the increased amount is 
based upon newly discovered evidence not reasonably discoverable at the 
time the administrative claim was filed, or upon allegation and proof of 
intervening facts relating to the amount of the claim.
    (g) Period of limitations-- (1) Time for filing. A civil action 
under paragraph

[[Page 449]]

(a) of this section must be brought in federal district court within 2 
years after the date the cause of action accrues.
    (2) Right of action accrues. A cause of action under paragraph (a) 
of this section accrues when the taxpayer has had a reasonable 
opportunity to discover all essential elements of a possible cause of 
action.
    (h) Recovery of costs under section 7430. Reasonable litigation 
costs, including attorney's fees, not recoverable under this section may 
be recoverable under section 7430. If following the Internal Revenue 
Service's denial of an administrative claim on the grounds that the 
Internal Revenue Service did not violate section 7433(a), a taxpayer 
brings a civil action for damages in a district court of the United 
States, and establishes entitlement to damages under this section, 
substantially prevails with respect to the amount of damages in 
controversy and meets the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A)(iii) 
(relating to notice and net worth requirements), the taxpayer will be 
considered a ``prevailing party'' for purposes of section 7430. Such 
taxpayer, therefore, will generally be entitled to attorney's fees and 
other reasonable litigation costs not recoverable under this section. 
For purposes of this paragraph, if the Internal Revenue Service does not 
respond on the merits to an administrative claim for damages within six 
months after the claim is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure 
to respond shall be considered a denial of the claim on the grounds that 
the Internal Revenue Service did not violate section 7432(a). 
Administrative costs, including attorney's fees incurred pursuing an 
administrative claim under paragraph (e) of this section, are not 
recoverable under section 7430.
    (i) Effective date. This section applies with respect to civil 
actions under section 7433 filed after January 30, 1992.

Sec. 301.7476-1  Declaratory judgments.

    See the regulations under section 7476 contained in Part 1 of this

application to interested parties.

[T.D. 7421, 41 FR 20878, May 21, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7477-1  Declaratory judgments relating to transfers of property from the United States.

    (a) Petition--(1) General rule. A transferor or transferee of stock, 
securities of property transferred in an exchange described in section 
367(a)(1) may petition the Tax Court for a declaratory judgment with 
respect to the exchange if--
    (i) The pleading is timely filed; and
    (ii) The exchange has begun before the pleading is filed.
    (2) Pleading timely filed. The pleading is timely filed if it is 
filed before the 92d day after the day on which notice of the 
determination of the Commissioner is sent to the petitioner by certified 
or registered mail. In the absence of such notice, neither section 7477 
nor this section imposes any time limit on the filing of the pleading.

[[Page 451]]

    (3) Beginning of exchange. An exchange generally shall be considered 
to begin upon the beginning of the first transfer of property pursuant 
to the plan under which the exchange is to be made. For rules 
determining the beginning of a transfer, see Sec. 1.367(a)-1(c)(4).

A transfer shall not be considered to begin with a decision of a board 
of directors or similar action. A transfer shall be deemed to have begun 
even though it is made subject to a condition that, if there is a 
failure to obtain a determination that the exchange is not in pursuance 
of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of 
Federal income taxes, the transaction will not be consummated and to the 
extent possible the assets transferred will be returned.
    (b) Judgment--(1) General rule. The Tax Court may issue a 
declaratory judgment or decree within the scope described in section 
7477(a)(2) if--
    (i) There is a case of actual controversy, and
    (ii) The petitioner has exhausted the administrative remedies 
available to it within the Internal Revenue Service,

with respect to a determination or a failure to make a determination.
    (2) Exhaustion of administrative remedies. The petitioner shall be 
deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available to it 
within the Internal Revenue Service if--
    (i) The petitioner has completed all applicable procedures published 
in regulations, the statement of procedural rules (26 CFR Part 601) or 
revenue procedures relating to the filing of a request for a ruling 
under section 367(a)(1) and, if such a ruling has been issued, to the 
filing of a protest to such a ruling;
    (ii) The petitioner has submitted prompt and complete responses to 
any requests by the Internal Revenue Service for further information; 
and
    (iii) The Internal Revenue Service has had a reasonable time to act 
upon the request for the ruling, any protest thereto and any additional 
information submitted in response to any request made therefor by the 
Internal Revenue Service. If there has been a failure to make a 
determination, the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed not to have 
had a reasonable time to act before the expiration of 270 days after the 
day on which petitioner properly filed the request for a ruling. In no 
event shall the Internal Revenue Service be deemed to have had a 
reasonable time to act if a failure to act has occurred because the 
petitioner did not proceed with due diligence or because the petitioner 
has not provided all available information or materials reasonably 
requested by the Internal Revenue Service.
    (3) Effect of judgment. The declaratory judgment or decree of the 
Tax Court, when final under section 7481, shall be binding on the 
parties to the case for purposes of section 367(a)(1). However, if the 
facts of the exchange differ from those presented to the Court, the 
judgment shall be binding only to the extent appropriate under the legal 
doctrines of estoppel and stare decisis.
    (c) Definitions--(1) Exchange described to section 367(a)(1). For 
purposes of this section, an ``exchange described in section 367(a)(1)'' 
is an exchange in connection with which the petitioner has filed a 
ruling request pursuant to section 367(a)(1) and the regulations 
thereunder without regard to whether or not section 332, 351, 354, 355, 
356 or 361 applies to the exchange.
    (2) Determination. For purposes of this section, a ``determination'' 
is the Commissioner's determination for purposes of section 367(a)(1), 
made in response to the petitioner's protest to a ruling issued under 
section 367(a)(1)--
    (i) That an exchange described in section 367(a)(1) is in pursuance 
of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of 
Federal income taxes, or
    (ii) Of the terms and conditions pursuant to which such an exchange

                   Court Review of Tax Court Decisions


<R05>
Sec. 301.7481-1   Date when Tax Court decision becomes final; decision modified or reversed.

    (a) Upon mandate of Supreme Court. Under section 7481(3)(A) of the 
Code, if the Supreme Court directs that the decision of the Tax Court be 
modified or reversed, the decision of the Tax Court rendered in 
accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court shall become final upon 
the expiration of 30 days from the time it was rendered, unless within 
such 30 days either the Commissioner or the taxpayer has instituted 
proceedings to have such decision corrected to accord with the mandate, 
in which event the decision of the Tax Court shall become final when so 
corrected.
    (b) Upon mandate of the Court of Appeals. Under section 7481(3)(B) 
of the Code, if the decision of the Tax Court is modified or reversed by 
the U.S. Court of Appeals, and if--
    (i) The time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari has 
expired and no such petition has been duly filed, or
    (ii) The petition for certiorari has been denied, or
    (iii) The decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals has been affirmed by 
the Supreme Court, then the decision of the Tax Court rendered in 
accordance with the mandate of the U.S. Court of Appeals shall become 
final on the expiration of 30 days from the time such decision of the 
Tax Court was rendered, unless within such 30 days either the 
Commissioner or the taxpayer has instituted proceedings to have such 
decision corrected so that it will accord with the mandate, in which 
event the decision of the Tax Court shall become final when so 
corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7482-1   Courts of review; venue.

    Under section 7482(b)(2) of the Code, decisions of the Tax Court may 
be reviewed by any U.S. Court of Appeals which may be designated by the 
Commissioner and the taxpayer by stipulation in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7483-1   Petition for review.

    The decision of the Tax Court may be reviewed by a U.S. Court of 
Appeals as provided in section 7482 of the Code if a petition for such 
review is filed by either the Commissioner or the taxpayer within 3 
months after the decision is rendered. If, however, a petition for such 
review is so filed by one party to the proceeding, a petition for review 
of the decision of the Tax Court may be filed by any other party to the 
proceeding within 4 months after such decision is rendered.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7484-1   Change of incumbent in office.

    When the incumbent of the office of Commissioner changes, no 
substitution of the name of his successor shall be required in 
proceedings pending before any appellate court reviewing the action of 
the Tax Court.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 301.7502-1   Timely mailing treated as timely filing.

    (a) General rule. Section 7502 provides that, if the requirements of 
such section are met, a document shall be deemed to be filed on the date 
of the postmark stamped on the cover in which such document was mailed. 
Thus, if the cover containing such document bears a timely postmark, the 
document will be considered filed timely although it is received after 
the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing such 
document. Section 7502 does not apply to the payment of any tax. Section 
7502 is applicable only to those documents which come within the 
definition of such term provided by paragraph (b) of this section and 
only if the document is mailed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section and is delivered in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (b) Document defined. (1) The term ``document,'' as used in this 
section,

[[Page 453]]

means any claim, statement, or other document required to be filed 
within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under 
authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws, except as 
provided in the following subdivisions of this subparagraph:
    (i) The term does not include any return required under authority of 
any internal revenue law or any other document required under authority 
of chapter 61 of the Code. Thus, for example, such term does not include 
the income tax returns required by section 6012, the declarations of 
estimated income tax by individuals and corporations required by 
sections 6015 and 6016, and the estate tax and gift tax returns required 
by sections 6018 and 6019. Nor does the term include any return required 
under authority of subtitle E of the Code, relating to alcohol, tobacco, 
and certain other excise taxes.
    (ii) The term does not include any document filed in any court other 
than the Tax Court, but the term does include any document filed with 
the Tax Court, including a petition for redetermination of a deficiency 
and a petition for review of a decision of the Tax Court.
    (iii) The term does not include any document which is required to be 
filed with a bank or other depositary pursuant to section 6302(c).
    (2) A return may contain, or have attached to it, a statement which 
sets forth an election under the internal revenue laws. In such a case, 
section 7502 is applicable to the statement if the conditions of such 
section are met, although it does not apply to the return. Moreover, in 
the case of certain taxes, a return may constitute a claim for refund or 
credit. In such a case, section 7502 is applicable to the claim for 
refund or credit if the conditions of such section are met, irrespective 
of whether the claim is also a return.
    (c) Mailing requirements. (1) Section 7502 is not applicable unless 
the document is mailed in accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) The document must be contained in an envelope or other 
appropriate wrapper, properly addressed to the agency, officer, or 
office with which the document is required to be filed.
    (ii) The document must be deposited within the prescribed time in 
the mail in the United States with sufficient postage prepaid. For this 
purpose, a document is deposited in the mail in the United States when 
it is deposited with the domestic mail service of the U.S. Post Office. 
The domestic mail service of the U.S. Post Office, as defined by the 
postal regulations, includes mail transmitted within, among, and between 
the United States, its Territories and possessions, and Army-Air Force 
(APO) and Navy (FPO) post offices (see 39 CFR 2.1). Section 7502 does 
not apply to any document which is deposited with the mail service of 
any other country.
    (iii)(a) If the postmark on the envelope or wrapper is made by the 
U.S. Post Office, such postmark must bear a date on or before the last 
date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document. 
If the postmark does not bear a date on or before the last date, or the 
last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document, the document 
will be considered not to be filed timely, regardless of when the 
document is deposited in the mail. Accordingly, the sender who relies 
upon the applicability of section 7502 assumes the risk that the 
postmark will bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of 
the period, prescribed for filing the document, but see subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph (c), with respect to the use of registered mail or 
certified mail to avoid this risk. If the postmark on the envelope or 
wrapper is not legible, the person who is required to file the document 
has the burden of proving the time when the postmark was made. 
Furthermore, in case the cover containing a document bearing a timely 
postmark made by the U.S. Post Office is received after the time when a 
document postmarked and mailed at such time would ordinarily be 
received, the sender may be required to prove that it was timely mailed.
    (b) If the postmark on the envelope or wrapper is made other than by 
the U.S. Post Office, (1) the postmark so made must bear a date on or 
before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for 
filing the document, and (2) the document must be received by

[[Page 454]]

the agency, officer, or office with which it is required to be filed not 
later than the time when a document contained in an envelope or other 
appropriate wrapper which is properly addressed and mailed and sent by 
the same class of mail would ordinarily be received if it were 
postmarked at the same point of origin by the U.S. Post Office on the 
last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the 
document. However, in case the document is received after the time when 
a document so mailed and so postmarked by the U.S. Post Office would 
ordinarily be received, such document will be treated as having been 
received at the time when a document so mailed and so postmarked would 
ordinarily be received, if the person who is required to file the 
document establishes (i) that it was actually deposited in the mail 
before the last collection of the mail from the place of deposit which 
was postmarked (except for the metered mail) by the U.S. Post Office on 
or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for 
filing the document, (ii) that the delay in receiving the document was 
due to a delay in the transmission of the mail, and (iii) the cause of 
such delay. If the envelope has a postmark made by the U.S. Post Office 
in addition to the postmark not so made, the postmark which was not made 
by the U.S. Post Office shall be disregarded, and whether the envelope 
was mailed in accordance with this subdivision shall be determined 
solely by applying the rule of (a) of this subdivision.
    (2) If the document is sent by U.S. registered mail, the date of 
registration of the document shall be treated as the postmark date. If 
the document is sent by U.S. certified mail and the sender's receipt is 
postmarked by the postal employee to whom such document is presented, 
the date of the U.S. postmark on such receipt shall be treated as the 
postmark date of the document. Accordingly, the risk that the document 
will not be postmarked on the day that it is deposited in the mail may 
be overcome by the use of registered mail or certified mail.
    (3) As used in this section, the term ``the last date, or the last 
day of the period, prescribed for filing the document'' includes any 
extension of time granted for such filing. When the last date, or the 
last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, section 7503 is also applicable, so 
that, in applying the rules of this paragraph, the next succeeding day 
which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday shall be treated as 
the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the 
document.
    (d) Delivery. (1) Section 7502 is not applicable unless the document 
is delivered by U.S. mail to the agency, officer, or office with which 
it is required to be filed. However, if the document is sent by 
registered mail or certified mail, proof that the document was properly 
registered or that a postmarked certified mail sender's receipt was 
properly issued therefor, and that the envelope or wrapper was properly 
addressed to such agency, officer, or office shall constitute prima 
facie evidence that the document was delivered to such agency, officer, 
or office.
    (2) Section 7502 is applicable only when the document is delivered 
after the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for 
filing the document. However, section 7502 is also applicable when a 
claim for credit or refund is delivered after the last day of the period 
specified in section 322(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or 
in any other corresponding provision of law relating to the limit on the 
amount of credit or refund that is allowable. For example, taxpayer A 
was required to file his income tax return for 1953 on or before March 
15, 1954, but he secured an extension until June 15, 1954, to file such 
return. His return was filed on June 15, 1954, but no tax was paid at 
such time because the tax liability disclosed by the return had been 
completely satisfied by the income tax that had been withheld on his 
wages and by the payments of estimated tax. On March 14, 1957, A mailed 
in accordance with the requirements of this section a claim for refund 
of a portion of his 1953 tax. The envelope containing the claim was 
postmarked on such day, but it was not delivered to the district 
director's office until March 18, 1957. Under section 322(b)(1) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1939,

[[Page 455]]

A's claim for refund is timely if filed within three years from June 15, 
1954. However, as a result of the limitation of section 322(b)(2) of the 
1939 Code, if his claim is not filed within three years after March 15, 
1954, the date on which he is deemed under section 322(e) of the 1939 
Code to have paid his 1953 tax, he is not entitled to any refund. Thus, 
since A's claim for refund was mailed in accordance with the 
requirements of this section and was delivered after the last day of the 
period specified in such section 322(b)(2), section 7502 is applicable, 
and the claim is deemed to have been filed on March 14, 1957.
    (e) Applicability--(1) General rule. Except as provided in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, section 7502 and this section are 
applicable with respect to any document which is mailed and delivered in 
accordance with the requirements of this section and which is mailed in 
an envelope having a postmark bearing a date after August 16, 1954, 
irrespective of whether the postmark is made by the U.S. Post Office, 
and irrespective of whether the tax to which the document pertains is 
imposed by the Code or a prior internal revenue law.
    (2) Exception. The provisions of section 7502 and this section which 
specifically apply to certified mail are applicable only if the mailing 
occurs on or after January 15, 1960.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7503-1   Time for performance of acts where last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

    (a) In general. Section 7503 provides that when the last day 
prescribed under authority of any internal revenue law for the 
performance of any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, 
such act shall be considered performed timely if performed on the next 
succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For 
this purpose, any authorized extension of time shall be included in 
determining the last day for performance of any act. Section 7503 is 
applicable only in case an act is required under authority of any 
internal revenue law to be performed on or before a prescribed date or 
within a prescribed period. For example, if the 2-year period allowed by 
section 6532(a)(1) to bring a suit for refund of any internal revenue 
tax expires on Thursday, November 23, 1995 (Thanksgiving Day), the suit 
will be timely if filed on Friday, November 24, 1995, in the Court of 
Federal Claims, or in a district court. Section 7503 applies to acts to 
be performed by the taxpayer (such as, the filing of any return of, and 
the payment of, any income, estate, or gift tax; the filing of a 
petition with the Tax Court for redetermination of a deficiency, or for 
review of a decision rendered by such Court; the filing of a claim for 
credit or refund of any tax) and acts to be performed by the 
Commissioner, a district director, or the director of a regional service 
center (such as, the giving of any notice with respect to, or making any 
demand for the payment of, any tax; the assessment or collection of any 
tax).
    (b) Legal holidays. For the purpose of section 7503, the term legal 
holiday includes the legal holidays in the District of Columbia as found 
in D.C. Code Ann. 28-2701. In the case of any return, statement, or 
other document required to be filed, or any other act required under the 
authority of the internal revenue laws to be performed, at an office of 
the Internal Revenue Service, or any other office or agency of the 
United States, located outside the District of Columbia but within an 
internal revenue district, the term legal holiday includes, in addition 
to the legal holidays in the District of Columbia, any statewide legal 
holiday of the state where the act is required to be performed. If the 
act is performed in accordance with law at an office of the Internal 
Revenue Service or any other office or agency of the United States 
located in a territory or possession of the United States, the term 
legal holiday includes, in addition to the legal holidays in the 
District of Columbia, any legal holiday that is recognized throughout 
the territory or possession in which the office is located.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7505-1   Sale of personal property acquired by the United States.

    (a) Sale--(1) In general. Any personal property (except bonds, 
notes, checks, and other securities) acquired by the

[[Page 456]]

United States in payment of or as security for debts arising under the 
internal revenue laws may be sold by the district director who acquired 
such property for the United States. United States savings bonds shall 
not be sold by the district director but shall be transferred to the 
appropriate office of the Treasury Department for redemption. Other 
bonds, notes, checks, and other securities shall be disposed of in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Commissioner.
    (2) Time, place, manner, and terms of sale. The time, place, manner, 
and terms of sale of personal property acquired for the United States 
shall be as follows:
    (i) Time, notice, and place of sale. The property may be sold at any 
time after it has been acquired by the United States. A public notice of 
sale shall be posted at the post office nearest the place of sale and in 
at least two other public places. The notice shall specify the property 
to be sold and the time, place, manner, and conditions of sale. In 
addition, the district director may use such other methods of 
advertising as he believes will result in obtaining the highest price 
for the property. The place of sale shall be within the internal revenue 
district where the property was originally acquired by the United 
States. However, if the district director believes that a substantially 
higher price may be obtained, the sale may be held outside his district.
    (ii) Rejection of bids and adjournment of sale. The internal revenue 
officer conducting the sale reserves the right to reject any and all 
bids and withdraw the property from the sale. When it appears to the 
internal revenue officer conducting the sale that an adjournment of the 
sale will best serve the interest of the United States, he may order the 
sale adjourned from time to time. If the sale is adjourned for more than 
30 days in the aggregate, public notice of the sale must again be given 
in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
    (iii) Liquidated damages. The notice shall state whether, in the 
case of default in payment of the bid price, any amount deposited with 
the United States will be retained as liquidated damages. In case 
liquidated damages are provided, the amount thereof shall not exceed 
$200.
    (3) Agreement to bid. The district director may, before giving 
notice of sale, solicit offers from prospective bidders and enter into 
agreements with such persons that they will bid at least a specified 
amount in case the property is offered for sale. In such cases, the 
district director may also require such persons to make deposits to 
secure the performance of their agreements. Any such deposit, but not 
more than $200, shall be retained as liquidated damages in case such 
person fails to bid the specified amount and the property is not sold 
for as much as the amount specified in such agreement.
    (4) Terms of payment. The property shall be offered for sale upon 
whichever of the following terms is fixed by the district director in 
the public notice of sale--
    (i) Payment in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, without 
regard to the amount of such bid, or
    (ii) If the aggregate price of all property purchased by a 
successful bidder at the sale is more than $200, an initial payment of 
$200 or 20 percent of the purchase price, whichever is the greater, and 
payment of the balance (including all costs incurred for the protection 
or preservation of the property subsequent to the sale and prior to 
final payment) within a specified period, not to exceed one month from 
the date of the sale.
    (5) Method of sale. The property may be sold either--
    (i) At public auction, at which open competitive bids shall be 
received, or
    (ii) At public sale under sealed bids.
    (6) Sales under sealed bids. The following rules, in addition to the 
other rules provided in this paragraph, shall be applicable to public 
sales under sealed bids.
    (i) Invitation to bidders. Bids shall be solicited through a public 
notice of sale.
    (ii) Form for use by bidders. A bid shall be submitted on a form 
which will be furnished by the district director upon request. The form 
shall be completed in accordance with the instructions thereon.
    (iii) Remittance with bid. If the total bid is $200 or less, the 
full amount of

[[Page 457]]

the bid shall be submitted therewith. If the total bid is more than 
$200, 20 percent of such bid or $200, whichever is greater, shall be 
submitted therewith. Such remittance shall be by a certified, cashier's, 
or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated 
under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, 
Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, 
bank, express, or telegraph money order.
    (iv) Time for receiving and opening bids. Each bid shall be 
submitted in a securely sealed envelope. The bidder shall indicate in 
the upper left hand corner of the envelope his name and address and the 
time and place of sale as announced in the public notice of sale. A bid 
will not be considered unless it is received by the internal revenue 
officer conducting the sale prior to the opening of the bids. The bids 
will be opened at the time and place stated in the notice of sale, or at 
the time fixed in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.
    (v) Consideration of bids. The internal revenue officer conducting 
the sale shall have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. 
After the opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the 
internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall announce the amount 
of the highest bid or bids and the name of the successful bidder or 
bidders, unless in the opinion of the officer a higher price can be 
obtained for the property than has been bid. In the event the highest 
bids are equal in amount (and unless in the opinion of the internal 
revenue officer conducting the sale a higher price can be obtained for 
the property than has been bid), the officer shall determine the 
successful bidder by drawing lots. Any remittance submitted in 
connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned to the bidder at 
the conclusion of the sale.
    (vi) Withdrawal of bids. A bid may be withdrawn on written or 
telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for 
opening the bids. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the 
bidder for the withdrawal of his bid after it has been opened.
    (7) Payment of bid price. All payments for property sold pursuant to 
this section shall be made by cash or by a certified, cashier's, or 
treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under 
the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, 
or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, 
or telegraph money order. If payment in full is required upon acceptance 
of the highest bid, the payment shall be made at such time. If payment 
in full is not made at such time, the internal revenue officer 
conducting the sale may forthwith proceed again to sell the property in 
the manner provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph (a). If 
deferred payment is permitted, the initial payment shall be made upon 
acceptance of the bid, and the balance shall be paid on or before the 
date fixed for payment thereof. Any remittance submitted with a 
successful sealed bid shall be applied toward the purchase price.
    (8) Delivery and removal of personal property. The risk of loss is 
on the purchaser of the property upon acceptance of his bid. Possession 
of any property shall not be delivered to the purchaser until the 
purchase price has been paid in full. If payment of part of the purchase 
price for the property is deferred, the United States will retain 
possession of such property as security for the payment of the balance 
of the purchase price and, as agent for the purchaser, will cause the 
property to be cared for until the purchase price has been paid in full 
or the sale is declared null and void for failure to make full payment 
of the purchase price. In such case, all charges and expenses incurred 
in caring for the property after acceptance of the bid shall be borne by 
the purchaser.
    (9) Certificate of sale. The internal revenue officer conducting the 
sale shall issue a certificate of sale to the purchaser upon payment in 
full of the purchase price.
    (b) Accounting. In case of the resale of such property, the proceeds 
of the sale shall be paid into the Treasury as internal revenue 
collections, and there

[[Page 458]]

shall be rendered by the district director a distinct account of all 
charges incurred in such sale. For additional accounting rules, see 
section 7809 and the instructions thereunder.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7506-1   Administration of real estate acquired by the United States.

    (a) Persons charged with. The district director for the internal 
revenue district in which the property is situated shall have charge of 
all real estate which is or shall become the property of the United 
States by judgment of forfeiture under the internal revenue laws, or 
which has been or shall be assigned, set off, or conveyed by purchase or 
otherwise to the United States in payment of debts or penalties arising 
under the laws relating to internal revenue or which has been or shall 
be vested in the United States by mortgage, or other security for 
payment of such debts, or which has been redeemed by the United States, 
or which has been or shall be acquired by the United States in payment 
of or as security for debts arising under the internal revenue laws, and 
of all trusts created for the use of the United States in payment of 
such debts due the United States.
    (b) Sale. The district director for the internal revenue district in 
which the property is situated may sell any real estate owned or held by 
the United States as aforesaid, subject to the following rules--
    (1) Property purchased at sale under levy. If the property was 
acquired as a result of being declared purchased for the United States 
at a sale under section 6335, relating to sale of seized property, the 
property shall not be sold until after the expiration of 120 days (or 1 
year in the case of such sale under levy before November 3, 1966) after 
such sale under levy.
    (2) Notice of sale. A notice of sale shall be published in some 
newspaper published or generally circulated within the county where the 
property is situated, or a notice shall be posted at the post office 
nearest the place where the property is situated and in at least two 
other public places. The notice shall specify the property to be sold 
and the time, place, manner, and conditions of sale. In addition, the 
district director may use other methods of advertising and of giving 
notice of sale if he believes such methods will enhance the possibility 
of obtaining a higher price for the property.
    (3) Time and place of sale. The time of the sale shall be not less 
than 20 days from the date of giving public notice of sale under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b). The place of sale shall be 
within the county where the property is situated. However, if the 
district director believes a substantially better price may be obtained, 
he may hold the sale outside such county.
    (4) Rejection of bids and adjournment of sale. The internal revenue 
officer conducting the sale reserves the right to reject any and all 
bids and withdraw the property from the sale. When it appears to the 
internal revenue officer conducting the sale that an adjournment of the 
sale will best serve the interest of the United States, he may order the 
sale adjourned from time to time. If the sale is adjourned for more than 
30 days in the aggregate, public notice of the sale must be given again 
in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b).
    (5) Liquidated damages. The notice shall state whether, in the case 
of default in payment of the bid price, any amount deposited with the 
United States will be retained as liquidated damages. In case liquidated 
damages are provided, the amount thereof shall not exceed $200.
    (6) Agreement to bid. The district director may, before giving 
notice of sale, solicit offers from prospective bidders and enter into 
agreements with such persons that they will bid at least a specified 
amount in case the property is offered for sale. In such cases, the 
district director may also require such persons to make deposits to 
secure the performance of their agreements. Any such deposit, but not 
more than $200, shall be retained as liquidated damages in case such 
person fails to bid the specified amount and the property is not sold 
for as much as the amount specified in such agreement.
    (7) Terms. The property shall be offered for sale upon whichever of 
the following terms is fixed by the district director in the public 
notice of sale:

[[Page 459]]

    (i) Payments in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, or
    (ii) If the price of the property purchased by a successful bidder 
at the sale is more than $200, an initial payment of $200 or 20 percent 
of the purchase price, whichever is the greater, and payment of the 
balance within a specified period, not to exceed one month from the date 
of the sale.
    (8) Method of sale. The property may be sold either--
    (i) At public auction, at which open competitive bids shall be 
received, or
    (ii) At public sale under sealed bids.
    (9) Sales under sealed bids. The following rules, in addition to the 
other rules provided in this paragraph (b), shall be applicable at 
public sales under sealed bids:
    (i) Invitation to bidders. Bids shall be solicited through a public 
notice of sale.
    (ii) Form for use by bidders. A bid shall be submitted on a form 
which will be furnished by the district director upon request. The form 
shall be completed in accordance with the instructions thereon.
    (iii) Remittance with bid. If the total bid is $200 or less, the 
full amount of the bid shall be submitted therewith. If the total bid is 
more than $200, 20 percent of such bid or $200, whichever is greater, 
shall be submitted therewith. Such remittance shall be by a certified, 
cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company 
incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of 
any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. 
postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.
    (iv) Time for receiving and opening bids. Each bid shall be 
submitted in a securely sealed envelope. The bidder shall indicate in 
the upper left hand corner of the envelope his name and address and the 
time and place of sale as announced in the public notice of sale. A bid 
shall not be considered unless it is received by the internal revenue 
officer conducting the sale prior to the opening of the bids. The bids 
will be opened at the time and place stated in the notice of sale, or at 
the time fixed in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.
    (v) Consideration of bids. The internal revenue officer conducting 
the sale shall have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. 
After the opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the 
internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall announce the amount 
of the highest bid or bids and the name of the successful bidder or 
bidders, unless in the opinion of the officer a higher price can be 
obtained for the property that has been bid. In the event the highest 
bids are equal in amount (and unless in the opinion of the internal 
revenue officer conducting the sale a higher price can be obtained for 
the property than has been bid), the officer shall determine the 
successful bidder by drawing lots. Any remittance submitted in 
connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned to the bidder at 
the conclusion of the sale.
    (vi) Withdrawal of bids. A bid may be withdrawn on written or 
telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for 
opening the bids. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the 
bidder for the withdrawal of his bid after it has been opened.
    (10) Payment of bid price. All payments for property sold pursuant 
to this section shall be made by cash or by a certified, cashier's, or 
treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under 
the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, 
or possession of the United States, or by U.S. postal, bank, express, or 
telegraph money order. If payment in full is required upon acceptance of 
the highest bid, the payment shall be made at such time. If payment in 
full is not made at such time, the internal revenue officer conducting 
the sale may forthwith proceed again to sell the property in the manner 
provided in subparagraph (8) of this paragraph (b). If deferred payment 
is permitted, the initial payment shall be made upon acceptance of the 
bid, and the balance shall be paid on or before the date fixed for 
payment thereof. Any remittance submitted with a successful sealed bid 
shall be applied toward the purchase price.
    (11) Deed. Upon payment in full of the purchase price, the district 
director shall execute a quitclaim deed to the purchaser.

[[Page 460]]

    (c) Lease. Until real estate is sold, the district director for the 
internal revenue district in which the property is situated may, in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Commissioner, lease such 
property.
    (d) Release to debtor. In cases where real estate has or may become 
the property of the United States by conveyance or otherwise, in payment 
of or as security for a debt arising under the laws relating to internal 
revenue, and such debt shall have been paid, together with the interest 
thereon (at the rate of 1 percent per month), to the United States 
within 2 years from the date of the acquisition of such real estate, the 
district director for the internal revenue district in which the 
property is located may release by deed or otherwise convey such real 
estate to the debtor from whom it was taken, or to his heirs or other 
legal representatives. If property is declared purchased by the United 
States under section 6335, then, for the purpose of this paragraph, the 
date of such declaration shall be deemed to be the date of acquisition 
of such real estate.
    (e) Accounting. The district director for the internal revenue 
district in which the property is situated shall, in accordance with 
section 7809 and the instructions thereunder, account for the proceeds 
of all sales or leases of the property and all expenses connected with 
the maintenance, sale, or lease of the property.
    (f) Authority of Commissioner. Notwithstanding the other paragraphs 
of this section, the Commissioner may, when he deems it advisable, take 
charge of and assume responsibility for any real estate to which this 
section is applicable. In such case, the Commissioner will notify in 
writing the district director for the internal revenue district in which 
the property is situated. In any case where a single parcel of real 
estate is situated in more than one internal revenue district, the 
Commissioner may designate in writing a district director who shall have 
charge of and be responsible for the entire property.

Sec. 301.7507-1   Banks and trust companies covered.

    (a) Section 7507 applies to any national bank, or bank or trust 
company organized under State law, a substantial portion of the business 
of which consists of receiving deposits and making loans and discounts, 
and which has--
    (1) Ceased to do business by reason of insolvency or bankruptcy, or
    (2) Been released or discharged from its liability to its depositors 
for any part of their deposit claims, and the depositors have accepted 
in lieu thereof a lien upon its subsequent earnings or claims against 
its assets either (i) segregated and held by it for benefit of the 
depositors or (ii) transferred to an individual or corporate trustee or 
agent who liquidates, holds or operates the assets for the benefit of 
the depositors.
    (b) As used in this section and Secs. 301.7507-2 to 301.7507-11, 
inclusive:
    (1) The term bank, unless otherwise indicated by the context, means 
any national bank, or bank or trust company organized under State law, 
within the scope of section 7507.
    (2) The terms statute of limitations and limitations mean all 
applicable provisions of law (including section 7507) which impose, 
change, or affect the limitations, conditions, or requirements relative 
to the allowance of refunds and abatements or the assessment or 
collection of tax, as the case may be.
    (3) The term segregated assets includes transferred or trusteed 
assets, or assets set aside or earmarked, to all or a portion of which, 
or the proceeds of which, the depositors are absolutely or conditionally 
entitled.
    (4) The term ceased to do business means the bank no longer accepts 
deposits or makes loans and discounts, and is winding up its affairs and 
is in the process of liquidating its assets to pay depositors. A bank 
will not be considered to have ceased to do business on account of a 
transaction in which the bank--
    (i) Transfers assets and liabilities to a Bridge Bank in a transfer 
described in Sec. 1.597-4 of this chapter;
    (ii) Transfers assets and liabilities to any person in a transaction 
to which section 381(a) applies or in which the

[[Page 461]]

transferee receives property with a transferred basis;
    (iii) Transfers assets or liabilities to any person in a transaction 
in which Federal Financial Assistance (as defined in section 597) is 
provided to any party to the transaction, unless all the Federal 
Financial Assistance is deposit insurance under Sec. 301.7507-9(d); or
    (iv) Transfers assets or liabilities to any person in a transaction 
similar to any transaction described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through 
(iii) of this section. This paragraph (b)(4) applies to taxable years 
ending on or after April 22, 1992.

[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 8641, 60 FR 66105, Dec. 
21, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-2   Scope of section generally.

    (a) Purpose. Section 7507 is intended to assist depositors of a bank 
which had ceased to do business by reason of insolvency to recover their 
deposits, by prohibiting collection of taxes of the bank which would 
diminish the assets necessary for payment of its depositors and also 
assist depositors of banks which are in financial difficulties but 
which, in certain conditions, continue in business.
    (b) Requisites of application. In order that section 7507 shall 
operate in a case where the bank continues business it is necessary that 
the depositors shall agree to accept, in lieu of all or a part of their 
deposit claims as such, claims against segregated assets, or a lien upon 
subsequent earnings of the bank, or both. When such an agreement exists, 
no tax diminishing such assets or earnings, or both, otherwise available 
and necessary for payment of depositors, may be collected therefrom. If, 
under such an agreement, the depositors have the right also to look to 
the unsegregated assets of the bank for recovery, in whole or in part, 
the unsegregated assets are likewise, until they exceed the amount of 
the depositors' claims chargeable thereto, unavailable for tax 
collection. Any tax of such a bank, or part of any tax, which is once 
uncollectible under section 7507, cannot thereafter be collected except 
from any residue of segregated assets remaining after claims of 
depositors against such assets have been paid.
    (c) Interest. For the purposes of section 7507, depositors' claims 
include bona fide interest, either on the deposits as such, or on the 
claims accepted in lieu of deposits as such.
    (d) Limitations on immunity. Section 7507 is not primarily intended 
for the relief of banks as such. It does not prevent tax collection, 
from assets not necessary, or not available, for payment of depositors, 
from a bank within section 7507(a), at any time within the statute of 
limitations. In other words, the immunity of such a bank is not 
complete, but ceases whenever, within the statutory period for 
collection, it becomes possible to make collection without diminishing 
assets necessary for payment of depositors. In the case of a bank within 
section 7507(b), any immunity to which the bank is entitled is absolute 
except as to segregated assets. Any tax coming within such immunity may 
never be collected. With respect to segregated assets, such a bank is 
subject to the same rule as a bank within section 7507(a), that is to 
say, after claims of depositors against segregated assets have been 
paid, any surplus is subject, within the statute of limitations, to 
collection of any tax, due at any time, the collection of which was 
suspended by the section. The section is not for the relief of creditors 
other than depositors, although it may incidentally operate for their 
benefit. See Sec. 301.7507-4 and paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7507-9.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-3   Segregated or transferred assets.

    (a) In general. In a case involving segregated or transferred 
assets, it is not necessary, for application of section 7507, that the 
assets shall technically constitute a trust fund. It is sufficient that 
segregated assets be definitely separated from other assets of the bank 
and that transferred assets be definitely separated both from other 
assets of the bank and from other assets held or owned by the trustee or 
agent to whom assets of the bank have been transferred; that the bank be 
wholly or partially released from liability for repayment of deposits as 
such; and that the depositors have claims against the separated assets. 
Any excess of separated assets over the amount necessary

[[Page 462]]

for payment of such depositors will be available for tax collection 
after full payment of depositors' claims under the agreement against 
such assets. But see paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.7507-9.
    (b) Corporate transferees. Where the segregated assets are 
transferred to a separate corporate trustee or corporate agent, the 
assets and earnings therefrom are within the protection of the section, 
until full payment of depositors' claims against such assets and 
earnings, no matter by whom the stock of such corporation is held, and 
no matter whether the assets be liquidated or operated or held for 
benefit of the depositors.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-4   Unsegregated assets.

    (a) Depositors' claims against assets. (1) Claims of depositors, to 
the extent that they are to be satisfied out of segregated assets, will 
not be considered in determining the availability of unsegregated assets 
for tax collection. If depositors have agreed to accept payment out of 
segregated assets only, collection of tax from unsegregated assets will 
not diminish the assets available and necessary for payment of the 
depositors' claims. Thus, it may be possible to collect taxes from the 
unsegregated assets of a bank although the segregated assets are immune 
under the section.
    (2) If the unsegregated assets of the bank are subject to any 
portion of the depositors' claims, such unsegregated assets will be 
within the immunity of the section only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the claims to which such assets are subject. Taxes will still be 
collectible from the unsegregated assets to the extent of the amount by 
which the total value of such assets exceeds the liability to depositors 
to be satisfied therefrom. Therefore, if, for example, in the case of a 
bank having a tax liability, not previously immune under the section, of 
$50,000, the deposit claims against the bank are in the amount of 
$75,000, and the assets available for satisfaction of deposit claims 
amount to $100,000, the $50,000 tax is collectible to the extent of the 
$25,000 excess of assets over deposit claims. Collection is not to be 
postponed until the full amount of the tax is collectible.
    (b) Depositors' claims against earnings. Even though under a bona 
fide agreement a bank has been released from depositors' claims as to 
unsegregated assets, if all or a portion of its earnings are subject to 
depositors' claims, all assets the earnings from which, in whole or 
part, are charged with the payment of depositors' claims, will be immune 
from tax collection. But see paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.7507-5.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-5   Earnings.

    (a) Availability for tax collection. Earnings of a bank within 
section 7507(b), whether from segregated or unsegregated assets, which 
are necessary for, applicable to, and actually used for, payment of 
depositors' claims under an agreement, are within the immunity of the 
section. If only a portion or percentage of income from segregated or 
unsegregated assets is available and necessary for payment of 
depositors' claims, the remaining income is available for tax 
collection. Earnings of the bank's first fiscal year ending after the 
making of the agreement not applicable to payment of depositors will be 
assumed to be applicable for collection of any tax due prior or 
subsequent to execution of the agreement. Earnings of subsequent fiscal 
periods from unsegregated assets not applicable to depositors' claims 
will be assumed to be applicable to payment of taxes as to which 
immunity under the section has not previously attached. Earnings from 
segregated assets are available for collection of tax, whether 
previously uncollectible under the section or not, after depositors' 
claims against such assets have been paid in full. See paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 301.7507-3 and paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.7507-9.
    (b) Tax computation. The fact that earnings of a given year may be 
wholly or partly unavailable under section 7507 for collection of taxes 
does not exempt the income for that year, or any part thereof, from tax 
liability. The section affects collectibility only, and is not concerned 
with taxability. Accordingly, the taxpayer's income tax return shall 
correctly compute the tax liability, even though in the opinion of the 
taxpayer it is immune from tax collection under the section. The tax 
shall be determined with respect to the

[[Page 463]]

entire gross income and not merely with respect to the portion of the 
earnings out of which tax may be collected. As to establishment of 
immunity from tax collection see Sec. 301.7507-7.

    Example. (1) An agreement, executed in the year 1954 between a bank 
and its depositors, provides (i) that certain assets are to be 
segregated for the benefit of the depositors who have waived (as claims 
against unsegregated assets of the bank) a percentage of the deposits; 
(ii) that 40 percent of the bank's net earnings, for years beginning 
with 1954, from unsegregated assets, shall be paid to the depositors 
until the portion of their claims waived with respect to unsegregated 
assets of the bank has been paid; and (iii) that the unsegregated assets 
shall not be subject to depositors' claims. The net income of the bank 
for the calendar year 1954 is $10,000, $4,000 produced by the 
segregated, and $6,000 produced by the unsegregated assets. Such amount 
shall be considered the net earnings for the purpose of section 7507 in 
computing the portion of the earnings to be paid to depositors. The bank 
has an outstanding tax liability for prior years of $7,000. The income 
tax liability of the bank for 1954 is 30 percent of $10,000, or $3,000, 
making a total outstanding tax liability of $10,000. The portion of the 
earnings of the bank for 1954 remaining after provision for depositors 
is $3,600 ($6,000 less 40 percent thereof, or $2,400). It will be 
assumed that of the total outstanding tax liability of $10,000, $3,600 
may be assessed and collected, leaving $6,400 to be collected from any 
excess of the segregated assets after claims of depositors against such 
segregated assets have been paid in full. No part of the $6,400 immune 
from collection from 1954 earnings may be collected thereafter from 
unsegregated assets of the bank or earnings therefrom, so that except 
for any possible surplus of the segregated assets the $6,400 is 
uncollectible.
    (2) In the year 1955, the earnings are again $10,000, $4,000 from 
segregated and $6,000 from unsegregated assets, as in 1954. However, the 
return filed shows income of $5,000 and a tax liability of $1,500. An 
investigation shows the true income to be $10,000, on which the tax is 
$3,000. The full $3,000 will be assumed to be collectible. The $600 
difference between $3,600 (the excess of earnings from unsegregated 
assets over the amount going to the depositors), and the $3,000 tax for 
1955, is not available for collection of the tax for prior years, which 
became immune as described above, but may be available for collection of 
tax for subsequent years.

    (c) No significance attaches to the selection of the years 1954 and 
1955 in the example set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The 
rules indicated by the example are equally applicable to subsequent or 
prior years not excluded by limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-6   Abatement and refund.

    (a) An assessment or collection, no matter when made, if contrary to 
section 7507, is subject to abatement or refund within the applicable 
statutory period of limitations.
    (b) Collection from a bank within section 7507(b) which diminishes 
assets necessary for payment of depositors, if made prior to agreement 
with depositors, is not contrary to the section, and affords no ground 
for refund.
    (c) Any abatement or refund is subject to existing statutory periods 
of limitation, which periods are not suspended or extended by section 
7507. In order to secure a refund of any taxes paid for any taxable year 
during the period of immunity the bank must file claim therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-7   Establishment of immunity.

    (a) The mere allegation of insolvency, or that depositors have 
claims against segregated or other assets or earnings, will not of 
itself secure immunity from tax collection. It must be affirmatively 
established to the satisfaction of the district director that collection 
of tax will be contrary to section 7507. See also Sec. 301.7507-8.
    (b) Any claim, by a bank, of immunity under section 7507(b), shall 
be supported by a statement, under oath or affirmation, which shall 
show: (1) The total of depositors' claims outstanding, and (2) 
separately and in detail, the amount of each of the following, and the 
amount of depositors' claims properly chargeable against each: (i) 
Segregated or transferred assets; (ii) unsegregated assets; (iii) 
estimated future average annual earnings and profits; (iv) amount 
collectible from shareholders; and (v) any other resources available for 
payment of depositors' claims. The detail shall show the full amount of 
depositors' claims chargeable against each of the items in subdivisions 
(i) to (v), inclusive, of this subparagraph even though part or all of 
the amount chargeable against a particular item is also chargeable 
against some other item or items.

[[Page 464]]

There shall also be filed a copy of any agreement between the bank and 
its depositors, and any other agreement or document bearing on the claim 
of immunity. The statement shall show the basis, as ``book,'' 
``market,'' etc., of valuation of the assets.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-8   Procedure during immunity.

    (a) Statements to be filed. As long as complete or partial immunity 
is claimed, a bank within section 7507(b) shall file with each income 
tax return a statement as required by Sec. 301.7507-7, in duplicate, and 
shall also file such additional statements as the district director may 
require. Whether or not additional statements shall be required, and the 
frequency thereof, will depend on the circumstances, including the 
financial status and apparent prospects of the bank, and the time which 
is available for assessment and collection. If a copy of an agreement or 
document has once been filed, a copy of the same agreement or document 
need not again be filed with a subsequent statement, if it is shown by 
the subsequent statement, when and where and with what return the copy 
was filed. In case of amendment a copy of the amendment must be filed 
with the return for the taxable year in which the amendment is made.
    (b) Failure to file. Failure of a bank to file any required 
statement will be treated as indicating that the bank is not entitled to 
immunity.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-9   Termination of immunity.

    (a) In general. (1) In the case of a bank within section 7507(a), 
immunity will end whenever, and to the extent that, taxes may be 
assessed and collected, within the applicable limitation periods as 
extended by section 7507, without diminishing the assets available and 
necessary for payment of depositors. Immunity of a bank within section 
7507 (b) is terminated, as to segregated assets, whenever claims of 
depositors against such assets have been paid in full. See 
Sec. 301.7507-3. As to segregated assets, the termination of immunity is 
complete, and any balance remaining after payment of depositors is 
available, within statutory limitations, for collection of tax due at 
any time. However, taxes of the bank will be collectible from segregated 
assets only to the extent that the bank has a legal or equitable 
interest therein. Assets as to which there has been a complete 
conveyance for benefit of depositors, and the bank has bonafide been 
divested of all legal and equitable interest, are not available for 
collection of the bank's tax liability.
    (2) As to unsegregated assets of a bank within section 7507(b), 
immunity terminates only as to taxes thereafter becoming due. When taxes 
are once immune from collection, the immunity as to unsegregated assets 
is absolute. But see paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.7507-4.
    (b) General creditors. While the immunity from tax collection is for 
protection of depositors, and not for benefit of general creditors, in 
some cases the immunity will not end until the assets are sufficient to 
cover indebtedness of creditors generally. This situation will exist 
where under applicable law the claims of general creditors are on a 
parity with those of depositors, so that to pay depositors in full it is 
necessary to pay all creditors in full.
    (c) Shareholder liability. In determining the sufficiency of the 
assets to satisfy the depositors' claims, shareholders' liability to the 
extent collectible shall be treated as available assets. See 
Sec. 301.7507-7.
    (d) Deposit insurance. Deposit insurance payable to depositors shall 
not be treated as an asset of the bank and shall be disregarded in 
determining the sufficiency of the assets to meet the claims of 
depositors. For taxable years ending on or after April 22, 1992, deposit 
insurance does not include Federal Financial Assistance (as defined in 
section 597) and other payments described in section 597(a) prior to its 
amendment by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and 
Enforcement Act of 1989 and, therefore, such payments must be taken into 
account to determine whether a bank's assets are sufficient to meet 
claims of depositors.
    (e) Notice by bank. A bank within section 7507(b), upon termination 
of immunity with respect to (1) earnings, (2) segregated or transferred 
assets, or (3) unsegregated assets, shall immediately

[[Page 465]]

notify the district director for the internal revenue district in which 
the taxpayer's returns were filed of such termination of immunity. See 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7507-8.
    (f) Payment by bank. As immunity terminates with respect to any 
assets, it will be the duty of the bank, without notice from the 
district director, to make payment of taxes collectible from such 
assets.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7507-10   Collection of tax after termination of immunity.

    If, in the case of a bank within section 7507(b), segregated assets 
(including earnings therefrom), in excess of those necessary for payment 
of outstanding deposits become available, such excess of segregated 
assets shall be applied toward satisfaction of accumulated outstanding 
taxes previously immune under the section, and not barred by the statute 
of limitations. But see Sec. 301.7507-3. Where sufficient segregated or 
unsegregated assets are available, statutory interest shall be collected 
with the tax. When unsegregated assets or earnings therefrom previously 
immune become available for tax collection, they will be available only 
for collection of taxes (including interest and other additions) 
becoming due after immunity ceases. See the example in paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 301.7507-5.

liability or inquiring into any offense connected with the 
administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws, any 
authorized officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service may 
examine any books, papers, records or other data which may be relevant 
or material to such inquiry; and take

[[Page 475]]

such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant 
to such inquiry.
    (b) Summons. For the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this 
section the Commissioner is authorized to summon the person liable for 
tax or required to perform the act, or any officer or employee of such 
person or any person having possession, custody, or care of books of 
accounts containing entries relating to the business of the person 
liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any other person 
deemed proper, to appear before a designated officer or employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service at a time and place named in the summons and to 
produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such 
testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry; 
and take such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be 
relevant or material to such inquiry. This summons power may be used in 
an investigation of either civil or criminal tax-related liability. The 
Commissioner may designate any employee of the Internal Revenue Service 
as the individual before whom a person summoned pursuant to section 
6420(e)(2), 6421(f)(2), 6424(d)(2), 6427(e)(2), or 7602 shall appear. 
Any such employee, when so designated in a summons, is authorized to 
take testimony under oath of the person summoned and to receive and 
examine books, papers, records, or other data produced in compliance 
with the summons.
    (c) Proscription on issuing of administrative summons when a Justice 
Department referral is in effect--(1) In general. The Commissioner may 
neither issue a summons under this title nor initiate a proceeding to 
enforce a previously issued summons by way of section 7604 with respect 
to any person whose tax liability is in issue, if a Justice Department 
referral is in effect with respect to that person for that liability.
    (2) Justice Department referral in effect. A Justice Department 
referral is in effect with respect to any person when:
    (i) The Secretary recommends, within the meaning of this paragraph, 
that the Attorney General either commence a grand jury investigation of 
or criminal prosecution of such person for any alleged offense connected 
with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws, or
    (ii) The Attorney General (or Deputy Attorney General or Assistant 
Attorney General) under section 6103(h)(3)(B) requests in writing that 
the Secretary disclose a return of, or return information relating to, 
such person. The request must set forth that the need for disclosure is 
for the purpose of a grand jury investigation of or potential or pending 
criminal prosecution of such person for any alleged offense connected 
with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws.

The referral is effective at the time the document recommending criminal 
prosecution or grand jury investigation is signed by the Secretary or 
upon the Secretary's receipt of the section 6103(h)(3)(B) request.
    (3) Cessation of Justice Department referral. A Justice Department 
referral ceases to be in effect with respect to a person:
    (i) When the Secretary receives written notification from the 
Attorney General that the Justice Department:
    (A) Will not prosecute that person for any offense connected with 
the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws that gave 
rise to the referral under paragraph (2)(i) of this section, or
    (B) Will not authorize a grand jury investigation of that person 
with respect to such offense, or
    (C) Will discontinue any grand jury investigation of that person 
with respect to such offense;
    (ii) When a final disposition with respect to a criminal proceeding 
brought against that person has been made; or
    (iii) When the Secretary receives written notification from the 
Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney 
General, that the Justice Department will not prosecute such person for 
any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the 
internal revenue laws, based upon a previous request for disclosure 
under section 6103(h)(3)(B).
    (4) Taxable years and taxes imposed by separate chapters of the Code 
treated separately--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, each 
taxable period (or, if there is no taxable period, each taxable

[[Page 476]]

event) and each tax imposed by a separate chapter of the Code is treated 
separately.
    (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this paragraph (c)(4):

    Example 1. A Justice Department referral is in effect for D's 
criminal evasion of income tax for the taxable year 1979. The Commission 
may issue a summons respecting D's 1980 criminal and/or civil tax 
liability. The Commissioner may not issue a summons respecting D's 1979 
income tax liability.
    Example 2. A referral has been made to the Department of Justice for 
the criminal prosecution of F with regard to F's income tax liability 
for the taxable year 1978. The Commissioner may issue a summons 
respecting F's gift tax liability for the taxable year 1978.
    Example 3. A referral has been made to the Department of Justice for 
a grand jury investigation respecting G's 1980 income tax liability. The 
Commissioner may issue a summons related to an investigation of G's 
liability for Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) taxes for the 
taxable year 1980.
    Example 4. A referral has been made to the Department of Justice 
respecting J's criminal evasion of windfall profit tax for all quarters 
of the calendar year 1982. The Commissioner may issue a summons 
respecting J's liability for highway motor vehicle use tax covering the 
same periods.
    Example 5. A referral has been made to the Department of Justice for 
a grand jury investigation respecting L's 1983 income tax liability. The 
Commissioner may issue a summons related to the investigation of L's 
liability under sections 6700 (abusive tax shelter promoter penalty) and 
7408 of the Code for his conduct during 1983.

    (d) Effective date. This section is effective after September 3, 
1982. For rules effective on or before September 3, 1982, see 26 CFR 
301.7602-1 (revised as of April 1, 1984).

Sec. 301.7603-1   Service of summons.

    (a) In general. A summons issued under section 6420(e)(2), 
6421(f)(2), 6424(d)(2), 6427(e)(2), or 7602 shall be served by an 
attested copy delivered in hand to the person to whom it is directed, or 
left at his last and usual place of abode. The certificate of service 
signed by the person serving the summons shall be evidence of the facts 
it states on the hearing of an application for the enforcement of the 
summons. When the summons requires the production of books, papers, 
records, or other data, it shall be sufficient if such books, papers, 
records, or other data are described with reasonable certainty.
    (b) Persons who may serve a summons. The officers and employees of 
the Internal Revenue Service whom the Commissioner has designated to 
carry out the authority given him by Sec. 301.7602-1(b) to issue a 
summons are authorized to serve a summons issued under section 
6420(e)(2), 6421(f)(2), 6424(d)(2), 6427(e)(2), or 7602.

[T.D. 7188, 37 FR 12796, June 29, 1972, as amended by T.D. 7297, 38 FR

<R05>
Sec. 301.7604-1   Enforcement of summons.

    (a) In general. Whenever any person summoned under section 
6420(e)(2), 6421(f)(2), or 7602 neglects or refuses to obey such 
summons, or to produce books, papers, records, or other data, or to give 
testimony, as required, application may be made to the judge of the 
district court or to a U.S. commissioner for the district within which 
the person so summoned resides or is found for an attachment against him 
as for a contempt.
    (b) Persons who may apply for an attachment. The officers and 
employees of the Internal Revenue Service whom the Commissioner has 
designated to carry out the authority given him by Sec. 301.7602-1(b) to 
issue a summons are authorized to apply for an attachment as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7605-1   Time and place of examination.

    (a) Time and place of examination to be reasonable--(1) In general. 
The time and place of examination pursuant to the provisions of sections 
6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427(j)(2), or 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code 
are to be fixed by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue 
Service, and officers and employees are to endeavor to schedule a time 
and place that are reasonable under the circumstances. This section sets 
forth general criteria for the Service to apply in determining whether a

[[Page 477]]

particular time and place for an examination are reasonable under the 
circumstances. Officers and employees should exercise sound judgment in 
applying these criteria to the circumstances at hand and should balance 
convenience of the taxpayer with the requirements of sound and efficient 
tax administration.
    (2) International examinations. Except for the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this section does not apply to 
examinations that fall under the jurisdiction of the Office of the 
Assistant Commissioner (International).
    (3) Criminal investigations. Except for the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, this section does not apply to criminal 
investigations.
    (b) Time of examination--(1) Date and time of examination. It is 
reasonable for the Service to schedule the day (or days) for an 
examination during a normally scheduled workday (or workdays) of the 
Service, during the Service's normal business hours. It is reasonable 
for the Service to schedule examinations throughout the year, without 
regard to seasonal fluctuations in the businesses of particular 
taxpayers or their representatives. However, the Service will work with 
taxpayers or their representatives to try to minimize any adverse 
effects in scheduling the date and time of an examination.
    (2) Date of appearance when summons is used. If a summons is issued 
under authority of section 7602(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, or 
under the corresponding authority of sections 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), or 
6427(j)(2), the date fixed for appearance before an officer or employee 
of the Service must be no less than 10 days from the date of the 
summons.
    (c) Type of examination--(1) In general. The Service will determine 
whether an examination will be an office examination (i.e., an 
examination conducted at a Service office) or a field examination (i.e., 
an examination conducted at the taxpayer's residence or place of 
business, or some other location that is not a Service office), based 
upon the complexity of the return and which form of examination will be 
more conducive to effective and efficient tax administration.
    (2) Office examination held in location other than Service office in 
case of clear need. The Service will grant a request to hold an office 
examination at a location other than a Service office in a case of clear 
need, such as when it would be unreasonably difficult for the taxpayer 
to travel to a Service office because of the taxpayer's advanced age or 
infirm physical condition, or when the taxpayer's books, records, and 
source documents are too cumbersome for the taxpayer to bring to a 
Service office.
    (d) Place of examination--(1) In general. The Service generally will 
make an initial determination of the place for an examination, including 
the Internal Revenue Service district to which an examination will be 
assigned, based upon the address shown on the return for the period 
selected for examination. Requests by taxpayers to transfer the place of 
examination will be resolved on a case-by-case basis, using the criteria 
set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Office examinations--(i) In general. An office examination of an 
individual or sole proprietorship generally is based on the residence of 
the individual taxpayer. An office examination of a taxpayer that is an 
entity generally is based on the location where the taxpayer entity's 
original books, records, and source documents are maintained. An office 
examination generally will take place at the closest Service office 
within the district encompassing the taxpayer's residence or at the 
closest Service office within the district where the taxpayer entity's 
books, records, and source documents are maintained. It generally is not 
reasonable for the Service to require a taxpayer to attend an 
examination at an office within an assigned district other than the 
closest Service office.
    (ii) Exception. If the office within the assigned district closest 
to an individual taxpayer's residence or the location where a taxpayer 
entity's books, records and source documents are maintained does not 
have an examination group or the appropriate personnel to conduct the 
examination, it generally is reasonable for the Service to require the 
taxpayer to attend an examination at the closest Service office

[[Page 478]]

within the assigned district that has an examination group or the 
appropriate personnel.
    (iii) Travel considerations. In scheduling office examinations, the 
Service in appropriate circumstances will take into account the distance 
a taxpayer would have to travel.
    (3) Field examinations--(i) In general. A field examination will 
generally take place at the location where the taxpayer's original 
books, records, and source documents pertinent to the examination are 
maintained. In the case of a sole proprietorship or taxpayer entity, 
this will usually be the taxpayer's principal place of business.
    (ii) Exception for certain small businesses. If an examination is 
scheduled by the Service at the taxpayer's place of business and the 
taxpayer represents to the Service in writing that conducting the 
examination at the place of business would essentially require the 
business to close or would unduly disrupt business operations, the 
Service, upon verification, will change the place of examination to a 
Service office within the district where the taxpayer's books, records, 
and source documents are maintained.
    (iii) Site visitations. Regardless of where an examination takes 
place, the Service may visit the taxpayer's place of business or 
residence to establish facts that can only be established by direct 
visit, such as inventory or asset verification. The Service generally 
will visit for these purposes on a normal workday of the Service during 
the Service's normal duty hours.
    (e) Requests by taxpayers to change place of examination--(1) In 
general. The Service will consider, on a case-by-case basis, written 
requests by taxpayers or their representatives to change the place that 
the Service has set for an examination. In considering these requests, 
the Service will take into account the following factors--
    (i) The location of the taxpayer's current residence;
    (ii) The location of the taxpayer's current principal place of 
business;
    (iii) The location at which the taxpayer's books, records, and 
source documents are maintained;
    (iv) The location at which the Service can perform the examination 
most efficiently;
    (v) The Service resources available at the location to which the 
taxpayer has requested a transfer; and
    (vi) Other factors that indicate that conducting the examination at 
a particular location could pose undue inconvenience to the taxpayer.
    (2) Circumstances in which the Service normally will permit 
transfers. A request by a taxpayer to transfer the place of examination 
will generally be granted under the following circumstances:
    (i) Office examination--(A) If the current residence of the 
taxpayer, in the case of an individual or sole proprietorship, or the 
location where the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are 
maintained, in the case of a taxpayer entity, is closer to a different 
Service office in the same district as the office where the examination 
has been scheduled, the Service normally will agree to transfer the 
examination to the closer Service office.
    (B) If the current residence of a taxpayer, in the case of an 
individual or sole proprietorship, or the location where a taxpayer 
entity's books, records, and source documents are maintained, is in a 
district other than the district where the examination has been 
scheduled, the Service normally will agree to transfer the examination 
to the closest Service office in the other district.
    (ii) Field examinations--(A) If a taxpayer does not reside at the 
residence where an examination has been scheduled, the Service will 
agree to transfer the examination to the taxpayer's current residence.
    (B) If, in the case of an individual, a sole proprietorship, or a 
taxpayer entity, the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are 
maintained at a location other than the location where the examination 
has been scheduled, the Service will agree to transfer the examination 
to the location where the taxpayer's books, records, and source 
documents are maintained.
    (3) Transfer for convenience of taxpayer's representative. The 
location of the place of business of a taxpayer's representative will 
generally not be considered in determining the place for

[[Page 479]]

an examination. However, the Service in its sole discretion may 
determine, based on the factors described in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, to transfer the place of examination to the representative's 
office.
    (4) Transfer within thirteen months of expiration of limitations 
period. If any applicable period of limitations on assessment or 
collection provided in the Internal Revenue Code will expire within 
thirteen months from the date of a taxpayer's request to transfer the 
place of an examination, the Service may require, as a condition for an 
otherwise permissible transfer, that the taxpayer first agree in writing 
to extend the limitations period for up to one year.
    (5) Transfer to office with insufficient resources. The Service is 
not required to transfer an examination to an office or district that 
does not have adequate resources to conduct the examination.
    (f) Safety of Service officers and employees. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this regulation, officers and employees of the 
Service may decline to conduct an examination at a particular location 
if it appears that the possibility of physical danger may exist at that 
location. In these circumstances, the Service may transfer an 
examination to a Service office and take any other steps necessary to 
protect its officers and employees.
    (g) Transfers initiated by Service. Nothing in this section shall be 
interpreted as precluding the Service from initiating the transfer of an 
examination if the transfer would promote the effective and efficient 
conduct of the examination. Should a taxpayer request that such a 
transfer not be made, the Service will consider the request according to 
the principles and criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (h) Restrictions on examination of taxpayer. No taxpayer shall be 
subjected to unnecessary examination or investigations, and only one 
inspection of a taxpayer's books of account shall be made for each 
taxable year unless the taxpayer requests otherwise or unless an 
authorized internal revenue officer, after investigation, notifies the 
taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary. The 
inspection of a taxpayer's books of account pursuant to the procedures 
of Sec. 1.1441-4(b) (3) and (4) is not an inspection of a taxpayer's 
books of account for purposes of section 7605(b) and this section.
    (i) Restriction on examination of churches--(1) In general. This 
section imposes certain restrictions upon the examination of the books 
of account and religious activities of a church or convention or 
association of churches for the purpose of determining whether such 
organization may be engaged in activities the income from which is 
subject to tax under section 511 as unrelated business taxable income. 
The purposes of these restrictions are to protect such organizations 
from undue interference in their internal financial affairs through 
unnecessary examinations to determine the existence of unrelated 
business taxable income, and to limit the scope of examination for this 
purpose to matters directly relevant to a determination of the existence 
or amount of such income. This section also imposes additional 
restrictions upon other examinations of such organizations.
    (2) Books of account. No examination of the books of account of an 
organization which claims to be a church or a convention or association 
of churches shall be made except after the giving of notice as provided 
in this subparagraph and except to the extent necessary (i) to determine 
the initial or continuing qualification of the organization under 
section 501(c)(3); (ii) to determine whether the organization qualifies 
as one, contributions to which are deductible under section 170, 545, 
556, 642, 2055, 2106, or 2522; (iii) to obtain information for the 
purpose of ascertaining or verifying payments made by the organization 
to another person in determining the tax liability of the recipient, 
such as payments of salaries, wages, or other forms of compensation; or 
(iv) to determine the amount of tax, if any, imposed by the Code upon 
such organization. No examination of the books of account of a church or 
convention or association of churches shall be made unless the Regional 
Commissioner believes that such examination is necessary and so notifies 
the organization in writing at least 30 days in advance

[[Page 480]]

of examination. The Regional Commissioner will conclude that such 
examination is necessary only after reasonable attempts have been made 
to obtain information from the books of account by written request and 
the Regional Commissioner has determined that the information cannot be 
fully or satisfactorily obtained in that manner. In any examination of a 
church or convention or association of churches for the purpose of 
determining unrelated business income tax liability pursuant to such 
notice, no examination of the books of account of the organization shall 
be made except to the extent necessary to determine such liability.
    (3) Religious activities. No examination of the religious activities 
of an organization which claims to be a church or convention or 
association of churches shall be made except (i) to the extent necessary 
to determine the initial or continuing qualification of the organization 
under section 501(c)(3); (ii) to determine whether the organization 
qualifies as one, contributions to which are deductible under section 
170, 545, 556, 642, 2055, 2106, or 2522; or (iii) to determine whether 
the organization is a church or convention or association of churches 
subject to the provisions of part III of subchapter F of chapter 1. The 
requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph that the Regional 
Commissioner give notice prior to examination of the books of account of 
an organization do not apply to an examination of the religious 
activities of the organization for any purpose described in this 
subparagraph. Once it has been determined that the organization is a 
church or convention or association of churches, no further examination 
of its religious activities may be made in connection with determining 
its liability, if any, for unrelated business income tax.
    (4) Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to 
audits and examinations of taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1969.
    (j) Effective date. Paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, 
inclusive, are effective for examinations scheduled after April 2, 1993.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7609-1  Special procedures for third-party summonses.

    (a) In general. Section 7609 requires the Internal Revenue Service 
to follow special procedures when summoning the records of persons 
defined by section 7609(a)(3) as ``third-party recordkeepers.'' Under 
these special procedures, the person about whom information is being 
gathered must be notified in advance in many cases. If the person about 
whom information is being gathered has been given notice, that person 
has the right to institute, until and including the 20th day following 
the day such notice was served on or mailed to such notified person, a 
proceeding to quash the summons. During the time the validity of the 
summons is being litigated, the statutes of limitations are suspended 
under section 7609(e). Section 7609 does not restrict the authority 
under section 7602 (or under any other provision of law) to examine 
records and witnesses without serving a summons and without giving 
notice of an examination. Sections 301.7609-1 through 301.7609-5 relate 
to section 7609; Sec. 301.7609-2, discusses matters

[[Page 481]]

under sections 7609(a)(3) and 7609(i) relating to third-party 
recordkeepers; Sec. 301.7609-3 discusses matters under section 7609(b), 
relating to intervention rights; Sec. 301.7609-4 and the institution of 
a proceeding to quash; Sec. 301.7609-4 discusses matters under section 
7609(c), relating to summonses excepted from the section 7609 
procedures; and Sec. 301.7609-5 discusses matters under section 7609(e), 
relating to the suspension of the statute of limitations.
    (b) Effective dates. This section applies to summonses served after 
December 31, 1982. For the rules applicable to summonses issued on or 
after March 1, 1977 and served before January 1, 1983, see 26 CFR 
301.7609-1 (revised as of April 1, 1984).

[T.D. 8091, 51 FR 23054, June 25, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7609-2  Third-party recordkeepers.

    (a) Definitions--(1) Accountant. A person is an ``accountant'' under 
section 7609(a)(3)(F) for purposes of determining whether that person is 
a third-party recordkeeper if the person is registered, licensed, or 
certified under State law as an accountant.
    (2) Attorney. A person is an ``attorney'' under section 
7609(a)(3)(E) for purposes of determining whether that person is a 
third-party recordkeeper if the person is admitted to the bar of a 
State.
    (3) Credit cards--(i) Person extending credit through credit cards. 
The term ``person extending credit through the use of credit cards or 
similar devices'' under section 7609(a)(3)(C) generally includes any 
person who issues a credit card. It does not include a seller of goods 
or services that honors credit cards issued by other parties but does 
not extend credit on the basis of credit cards or similar devices issued 
by itself.
    (ii) Similar devices to credit cards. An object is a ``similar 
device'' to a credit card under section 7609(a)(3)(C) only if it is 
physical in nature, such as a coupon book, a charge plate, or a letter 
of credit. Thus, a person who extends credit by requiring credit 
customers to sign sales slips without requiring use of physical objects 
issued by that person is not a third-party recordkeeping under section 
7609(a)(3)(C).
    (b) When third-party recordkeeper status arises--(1) In general. A 
person is a ``third-party recordkeeper'' with respect to a given set of 
records only if the person made or kept the records in the person's 
capacity as a third-party recordkeeper. Thus, for instance, an 
accountant is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being an 
accountant) with respect to the accountant's records of a sale of 
property by the accountant to another person. Similarly, a credit card 
issuer is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being a person 
extending credit through the use of credit cards or similar devices) 
with respect to--
    (i) Records relating to noncredit card transactions, such as a cash 
sale by the issuer to a holder of the issuer's credit card; or
    (ii) Records relating to transactions involving the use of another 
issuer's credit card.
    (2) Examples. The rules of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. V issues a credit card (the V card) that is honored by R, 
a retailer. When using the V card, C signs a sales slip in triplicate. 
C, R, and V each retain one copy. Only the copy held by V is held by a 
third-party recordkeeper under section 7609 (a)(3), even though R may 
issue its own credit card.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except R does 
issue its own credit card to C (the R card). When C makes a credit 
purchase from R using the R card, C signs a sales slip in duplicate. C 
and R each retain one copy. Because R keeps the copy in its capacity as 
credit card issuer, as well as in its capacity as seller, it is a third-
party recordkeeper under section 7609 (a)(3) with respect to that copy.
    (c) Duty of third-party recordkeeper--(1) In general. Upon receipt 
of a summons, the third-party recordkeeper (``recordkeeper'') must begin 
to assemble the summoned records. The recordkeeper must be prepared to 
produce the summoned records on the date which the summons states the 
records are to be examined regardless of the institution of anticipated 
institution of a proceeding to quash or the recordkeeper's intervention 
(as allowed under section 7609(b)(2)(C)) into a proceeding to quash.
    (2) Disclosing recordkeepers not liable--(i) In general. A 
recordkeeper, or an agent or employee thereof, who makes

[[Page 482]]

a disclosure of records as required by this section, in good faith 
reliance on the certificate of the Secretary (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section) or an order of a court requiring production 
of records, will not be liable for such disclosure to any customer, or 
to any party with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued, 
or to any other person.
    (ii) Certificate of the Secretary. The Secretary may issue to the 
recordkeeper a certificate stating both:
    (A) That the 20-day period, within which a notified person may 
institute a proceeding to quash the summons, has expired; and
    (B) That no proceeding has been properly instituted within that 
period.

The Secretary may also issue a certificate to the recordkeeper if the 
taxpayer, with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued, 
expressly consents to the examination of the records summoned.
    (3) Reimbursement of costs. Recordkeepers may be entitled to 
reimbursement of their costs of assembling and preparing to produce 
summoned records, to the extent allowed by section 7610, even if the 
summons ultimately is not enforced.
    (d) Effective dates. This section, with the exception of paragraph 
(c), applies generally to all summonses issued on or after March 1, 
1977. Paragraph (c) applies only to summonses served after December 31, 
1982.

7610(a) and 7805))

[T.D. 7899, 48 FR 32772, July 19, 1983, as amended by T.D. 8091, 51 FR 
23054, June 25, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7609-3  Right to intervene; right to institute a proceeding to quash.

    (a) Notified person. Under section 7609(a), the Internal Revenue 
Service must give a notice of summons to any person, other than the 
person summoned, who is identified in the description of the books and 
records contained in the summons in order that such person may contest 
the right of the Service to examne the summoned records by instituting a 
proceeding to quash the summons. Thus, if the Service issues a summons 
to a bank requesting checking account records of more than one person 
all of whom are identified in the description of the records contained 
in the summons, then all such persons are notified persons entitled to 
notice under section 7609(a). Therefore, if the Service requests the 
records of a joint bank account of A and B both of whom are named in the 
summons, then both A and B are notified persons entitled to notice under 
section 7609(a).
    (b) Right to institute a proceeding to quash--(1) In general. 
Section 7609(b) grants a notified person the right to institute a 
proceeding to quash the summons in the United States district court for 
the district within which the person summoned resides or is found. 
Jurisdiction of the court is based on section 7609(h). The act of filing 
a petition in district court does not in and of itself institute a 
proceeding to quash under section 7609(b)(2). Rather, the filing of the 
petition must be coupled with notice as required by section 
7609(b)(2)(B).
    (2) Elements of institution of a proceeding to quash. In order to 
institute a proceeding to quash a summons the notified person (or the 
notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the 
direction or control of the notified person) must, not later than the 
20th day following the day the notice of the summons was served on or 
mailed to such notified person:
    (i) File a petition to quash in the name of the notified person in a 
district court having jurisdiction,
    (ii) Notify the Service by sending a copy of that petition by 
registered or certified mail to the Service employee and office 
designated to receive the copy in the notice of summons that was given 
to the notified person, and
    (iii) Notify the recordkeeper by sending to that recordkeeper by 
registered or certified mail a copy of the petition.
    Failure to give timely notice to either the summoned party or the 
Service in the manner described in this paragraph means that the 
notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash and the 
district court has no jurisdiction to hear the proceeding. Thus, for 
example, if the notified person mails a copy of the petition to the 
summoned person but not to the designated Service employee and office,

[[Page 483]]

the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. 
Similarly, if the notified person mails a copy of such petition to the 
summoned person but, instead of sending a copy of the petition by 
registered or certified mail to the designated employee and office, the 
notified person gives the designated employee and office the petition by 
some other means, the notified person has failed to institute a 
proceeding to quash.
    (3) Failure to institute a proceeding to quash. If the notified 
person fails to institute a proceeding to quash within 20 days following 
the day the notice of the summons was served on or mailed to such 
notified person, the Service may examine the summoned records following 
the 23rd day after notice of the summons was served on or mailed to the 
notified person (see section 7609(d)(1)).
    (c) Presumption no notice has been mailed. Section 7609(b)(2)(B) 
permits a notified person to institute a proceeding to quash by filing a 
petition in district court and notifying both the Service and the 
summoned person. Unless the notified person has notified both the 
Service and the summoned person in the appropriate manner, the notified 
person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. If the copy of the 
petition has not been delivered to the summoned person or the person and 
office designated to receive the notice on behalf of the Service within 
3 days from the close of the 20-day period allowed to institute a 
proceeding to quash, it is presumed that the notification has not been 
timely mailed.
    (d) Effective date. This section applies to summonses served after 
December 31, 1982. For the rules applicable to summonses issued on or 
after March 1, 1977 and served before January 1, 1983, see 26 CFR 
301.7609-3 (revised as of April 1, 1984).

<R05>
Sec. 301.7609-4  Summonses excepted from section 7609 procedures.

    (a) In aid of the collection of certain liabilities--(1) In general. 
Section 7609(c)(2)(B) contains an exception to the general notice 
requirement when a summons is issued to a third-party recordkeeper. That 
section excepts summonses issued in aid of the collection of the 
liability of any person against whom an assessment has been made or 
judgment rendered or the liability at law or in equity of any transferee 
or fiduciary of such a person.
    (2) Examples. Examples of summonses referred to in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section are--
    (i) Summonses issued to determine the amount held in a bank in the 
name of a person against whom an assessment has been made or judgment 
rendered;
    (ii) Summonses issued for the purpose of ascertaining responsible 
corporate employees or officers for the 100 percent panalty under 
section 6672, so as to assist in collecting the amount of withheld taxes 
which have been assessed against the corporation; and
    (iii) Summonses issued to enforce transferee or fiduciary liability 
for a tax which has been assessed.
    (b) Numbered account (or similar arrangement). Under section 
7609(c)(2), a summons solely to determine the identity of a person 
having a numbered account (or similar arrangement) with a bank or other 
institution is excepted from the requirements of section 7609. A 
``numbered account (or similar arrangement)'' under section 7609(c)(2) 
is an account through which a person may authorize transactions solely 
through the use of a number, symbol, code name, or other device not 
involving the disclosure of the person's identity. A ``person having a 
numbered account (or similar arrangement)'' includes the person who 
opened the account and any person authorized to use the account or to 
receive records or statements concerning it.
    (c) Effective date. This section applies to all summonses issued 
after February 28, 1977.

(Secs. 7610(a) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 
7610(a) and 7805))

[T.D. 7899, 48 FR 32772, July 19, 1983, as amended by T.D. 8091, 51 FR 
23055, June 25, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7609-5  Suspension of statutes of limitations.

    (a) Agent, nominee, etc. Under section 7609(e), statutes of 
limitations are suspended if a notified person with respect to whose 
liability a summons is issued,

[[Page 484]]

or the notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under 
the direction or control of the notified person, takes any action as 
provided in section 7609(b). A person is a notified person's agent, 
nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of a 
notified person for purposes of section 7609(e) if the person with 
respect to whose liability the summons is issued has the ability in fact 
or at law to cause the agent, etc., to take the actions permitted under 
section 7609(b). Thus, in the case of a corporation, direction or 
control by the notified person may exist even though less than 50 
percent of the voting power of the corporation is held by the notified 
person.
    (b) Period during which a proceeding, etc., is pending. Under 
section 7609(e), the statute of limitations may be suspended for the 
period during which a proceeding, and appeals therein, with respect to 
the enforcement of such summons is pending. This period begins on the 
date the petition to quash the summons is filed in district court. The 
period continues until all appeals are disposed of, or until the 
expiration of the period in which an appeal may be taken or a request 
for a rehearing may be made. Full compliance, partial compliance, and 
noncompliance have no effect on the suspension provisions. Of course, if 
the notified person takes no action provided in subsection (b) of 
section 7609, no suspension of the statutes of limitations takes place. 
The periods of limitations which are suspended under section 7609(e) are 
those which apply to the taxable periods to which the summons relates.
    (c) Taking of action as provided in section 7609(b). Section 7609(b) 
allows intervention by a notified person as a matter of right upon 
compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The phrase ``takes 
any action as provided in subsection (b)'', found in section 7609(e), 
includes any intervention, whether or not section 7609(b) is 
specifically mentioned in the order of the court allowing intervention. 
The phrase also includes the fulfilling of only part of the requirements 
of section 7609(b)(2), relating to the right of a person to institute a 
proceeding to quash. Thus, for instance, if a notified person notifies a 
person who has been summoned by sending a copy of the petition by 
registered or certified mail but does not mail a copy of that notice to 
the appropriate person and office under section 7609(b)(2)(B), the 
notified person has taken an action under section 7609(e).
    (d) Effective dates. This section applies to summonses served after 
December 31, 1982. For the rules applicable to summonses issued on or 
after March 1, 1977, and before January 1, 1983, see 26 CFR 301.7609-5 
(revised as of April 1, 1984).

[T.D. 7899, 48 FR 32773, July 19, 1983, as amended by T.D. 8091, 51 FR 
23055, June 25, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7610-1  Fees and costs for witnesses.

    (a) Introduction. Section 7610 provides that the Internal Revenue 
Service may make payments to certain persons who are asked to give 
information to the Service. Under section 7610 witnesses generally will 
not be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred but instead will be paid 
in accordance with the payment rates established by regulations. 
Paragraph (b) of this section contains elaborations of certain terms 
found in section 7610 and definitions of other terms used in the 
regulations under section 7610(a)(b); and paragraphs (c) and (d) contain 
rules and rates applicable to payments under section 7610. Section 7610 
and its regulations are effective for summonses issued after February 
28, 1977, except as otherwise provided.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Directly incurred costs. Directly incurred 
costs are costs incurred solely, immediately, and necessarily as a 
consequence of searching for, reproducing, or transporting records in 
order to comply with a summons. They do not include a proportionate 
allocation of fixed costs, such as overhead, equipment depreciation, 
etc. However, where a third party's records are stored at an independent 
storage facility that charges the third party a search fee to search 
for, reproduce, or transport particular records requested, these fees 
are considered to be directly incurred by the summoned third party.

[[Page 485]]

    (2) Reproduction cost. Reproduction costs are costs incurred in 
making copies or duplicates of summoned documents, transcripts, and 
other similar material.
    (3) Search costs. Search costs include only the total-cost of 
personnel time directly incurred in searching for records or information 
and the cost of retrieving information stored by computer. Salaries of 
persons locating and retrieving summoned material are not includible in 
search costs. Also, search costs do not include salaries, fees, or 
similar expenditures for analysis of material or for managerial or legal 
advice, expertise, or research, or time spent for these activities.
    (4) Third party. A third party is any person served with a summons, 
other than a person with respect to whose liability a summons is issued, 
or an officer, employee, agent, accountant, or attorney of that person.
    (5) Third party records. Third party records are books, papers, 
records, or other data in which the person with respect to whose 
liability a summons is issued does not have a proprietary interest at 
the time the summons is served.
    (6) Transportation costs. Transportation costs include only costs 
incurred to transport personnel to search for records or information 
requested and costs incurred solely by the need to transport the 
summoned material to the place of examination. These costs do not 
include the cost of transporting the summoned witness for appearance at 
the place of examination. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for 
payment of travel expenses.
    (c) Conditions and rates of payments--(1) Basis for payment. Payment 
for search, reproduction, and transportation costs will be made only to 
third parties served with a summons to produce third party records or 
information and only for material requested by the summons. Payment will 
be made only for these costs that are both directly incurred and 
reasonably necessary. Search, reproduction, and transportation costs 
must be considered separately in determining whether costs are 
reasonably necessary. No payment will be made until the third party has 
satisfactorily complied with the summons and has submitted an itemized 
bill or invoice showing specific details concerning the costs to the 
Internal Revenue Service employee before whom the third party was 
summoned. If a third party charges any other person for any cost for 
which the third party is seeking payment from the Service, the amount 
charged to the other person must be subtracted from the amount the 
Internal Revenue Service must pay.
    (2) Payment rates. The following rates are established.
    (i) Search costs. (A) For the total amount of personnel time 
required to locate records or information, $8.50 per person hour for 
summonses issued after July 19, 1983. For summonses issued on or before 
such date, $5.00 per person hour.
    (B) For retrieval of information stored by computer in the format in 
which it is normally produced, actual costs, based on computer time and 
necessary supplies, except that personnel time for computer search is 
payable only under subparagraph (2)(i)(A) of this paragraph.
    (ii) Reproductions costs. (A) For copies of documents $.20 per page 
for summonses issued after July 19, 1983. For copies of documents issued 
on or before such date, $.10 per page.
    (B) For photographers, films and other materials, actual cost, 
except that personnel time is payable only under subparagraph (2)(i)(A) 
of this paragraph.
    (iii) Transportation costs. For transportation costs, actual cost, 
except that personnel time is payable only under subparagraph (2)(i)(A) 
of this paragraph.
    (d) Appearance fees and allowances--(1) In general. Under section 
7610(a)(1) and this paragraph, the Service shall pay a summoned person 
certain fees and allowances. No payments will be made until after the 
party summoned appears and has submitted any necessary receipts or other 
evidence of costs to the Service employee before whom the person was 
summoned. This paragraph is effective with respect to appearances made 
after October 26, 1978.
    (2) Attendance fees. A summoned person shall be paid an attendance 
fee for

[[Page 486]]

each day's attendance. A summoned person shall also be paid the 
attendance fee for the time necessarily occupied in going to and 
returning from the place of attendance at the beginning and end of the 
attendance or at any time during the attendance. The attendance fee is 
the higher of $30 per day or the amount paid under 28 U.S.C. 1821(b) to 
witnesses in attendance at courts of the United States at the time of 
the summoned person's appearance.
    (3) Travel allowances. A summoned person who travels by common 
carrier shall be paid for the actual expenses of travel on the basis of 
the means of transportation reasonably utilized and the distance 
necessarily traveled to and from the summoned person's residence by the 
shortest pratical route in going to and returning from the place of 
attendance. Such a summoned person shall utilize a common carrier at the 
most economical rate reasonably available. A receipt or other evidence 
of actual cost shall be furnished. A travel allowance equal to the 
mileage allowance which the Administrator of General Services has 
prescribed, under 5 U.S.C. 5704, for offical travel of employees of the 
Federal Government shall be paid to each summoned person who travels by 
privately owned vehicle. That rate is $.20 per mile as of April 20, 
1980. Computation of mileage under this paragraph shall be made on the 
basis of a uniform table of distances adopted by the Administrator of 
General Services. Toll charges for toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and 
ferries, taxicab fares between places of lodging and carrier terminals, 
and parking fees (upon presentation of a valid parking receipt) shall be 
paid in full to a summoned person incurring those expenses.
    (4) Subsistence allowances. A subsistence allowance shall be paid to 
a summoned person (other than a summoned person who is incarcerated) 
when an overnight stay is required at the place of attendance because 
the place is so far removed from the residence of the summoned person as 
to prohibit return thereto from day to day. A subsistence allowance for 
a summoned person shall be paid in an amount not to exceed the maximum 
per diem allowance prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, 
under 5 U.S.C. 5702(a), for official travel in the area of attendance by 
employees of the Federal Government. As of April 30, 1979, that maximum 
per diem allowance is $35 per day. A subsistence allowance for a 
summoned person attending in an area designated by the Administrator of 
General Services as a high-cost area shall be paid in an amount not to 
exceed the maximum actual subsistence allowance prescribed by the 
Administrator, under 5, U.S.C. 5702(c)(B), for official travel in that 
area by employees of the Federal Goverment. As of April 30, 1979, 
maximum rates of up to $50 per day have been prescribed by the 
Administrator for certain areas. An alien who has been paroled into the 
United States for prosecution, under section 212 (d)(5) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)), or an alien who 
either has admitted belonging to a class of aliens who are deportable or 
has been determined under section 242(b) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(b)) 
to be deportable, shall be ineligible to receive the fees or allowances 
provided for under section 7610(a)(1).

                           Church Tax Inquiry

    Q-1: When may the Internal Revenue Service begin an inquiry of a 
church's tax liability?

[[Page 487]]

    A-1: Under section 7611 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Internal 
Revenue Service may begin a church tax inquiry only when the appropriate 
Regional Commissioner (or higher Treasury official) reasonably believes, 
on the basis of facts and circumstances recorded in writing, that the 
organization (1) may not qualify for tax exemption as a church; (2) may 
be carrying on an unrelated trade or business (within the meaning of 
section 513); or (3) may be otherwise engaged in activities subject to 
tax. Information received by the Internal Revenue Service at its request 
may not be used to form the basis of a reasonable belief to begin a 
church tax inquiry, unless the Service's request is made within the 
procedures of section 7611, is a request permitted by these questions 
and answers to be made without application of the procedures of section 
7611, or is a request to which the procedures of section 7611 do not 
apply.
    Q-2: What is a church tax inquiry within the meaning of section 
7611?
    A-2: A church tax inquiry is any inquiry to a church (other than a 
routine request described in Q and A-4, an inquiry described in Q and A-
5, an investigation described in Q and A-6 or an examination described 
in Qs and As 10 and 14), to serve as a basis for determining whether the 
organization qualifies for tax exemption as a church or whether it is 
carrying on an unrelated trade or business or is otherwise engaged in 
activities subject to tax. An inquiry is considered to commence when the 
Internal Revenue Service requests information or materials from a church 
of a type contained in church records. The term ``church tax inquiry'' 
does not include routine requests for information or inquiries regarding 
matters which do not primarily concern the tax status or liability of 
the church itself. See Q and A-4 with respect to routine requests 
regarding, among other things, withholding responsibilities for income 
tax or FICA (social security) tax liabilities. See Q and A-6 with 
respect to the types of investigations, other than routine requests, 
that are outside the scope of the procedures of section 7611. See Q and 
A-5 with respect to requests for third party records that are outside 
the scope of the procedures of section 7611.
    Q-3: What is a ``church'' for purposes of the church tax inquiry and 
examination procedures of section 7611?
    A-3: Solely for purposes of applying the procedures of section 7611, 
and as used in these questions and answers, the term ``church'' includes 
any organization claiming to be a church and any convention or 
association of churches. For purposes of the procedures of section 7611 
and these questions and answers a church does not include separately 
incorporated church-supported schools or other organizations 
incorporated separately from the church.

                            Routine Requests

    Q-4: What is a routine request to a church that is outside the scope 
of and does not necessitate application of the procedures set forth in 
section 7611?
    A-4: Routine requests to a church will not be considered to commence 
a church tax inquiry and will not necessitate application of the 
procedures set forth in section 7611. Routine requests for this purpose 
include (but are not limited to) questions regarding (1) the filing or 
failure to file any tax return or information return by the church; (2) 
compliance with income tax or FICA (social security) tax withholding 
responsibilities by the church; (3) any supplemental information needed 
to complete the mechanical processing of any incomplete or incorrect 
return filed by the church; (4) information necessary to process 
applications for exempt status and letter ruling requests; (5) 
information necessary to process and update periodically a church's (i) 
registrations for tax-free transactions (excise tax), (ii) elections for 
exemption from windfall profit tax, or (iii) employment tax exemption 
requests; (6) information identifying a church that is used to update 
the Cumulative List of Tax Exempt Organizations (Publication No. 78) and 
other computer files; and (7) confirmation that a specific business is 
or is not owned or operated by a church.

[[Page 488]]

                           Third Party Records

    Q-5: To what extent may the Internal Revenue Service gain access to 
third party records?
    A-5: The Internal Revenue Service may request a church to provide 
information necessary to locate third-party records (for instance, bank 
records), including information regarding the church's chartered name, 
state and year of incorporation, and location of checking and savings 
accounts, without application of the procedures of section 7611.
    Records (for instance, cancelled checks or other records in the 
possession of a bank) held by third party recordkeepers, as defined in 
section 7609, are not considered church records. Thus, subject to the 
provisions set forth in section 7609 regarding third party summonses, 
access is permitted to such records without regard to the requirements 
of the procedures set forth in section 7611. The Internal Revenue 
Service is generally required, under other rules, to inform a church of 
any Internal Revenue Service requests for materials.
    Third party materials may be acquired without application of the 
procedures of section 7611; however, a determination that a church is 
not entitled to an exemption, or an assessment of tax for unrelated 
business income against a church, may not be made solely on the basis of 
third party records, without first complying with the requirements of 
two notices and offering of a conference (see Qs and As 9 and 10) 
pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 7611. This limitation 
does not apply to assessments of tax other than income tax resulting 
from loss of exemption or for unrelated business income (for instance, 
assessments of social security or other employment taxes). Third party 
bank records will not be used in a manner inconsistent with the 
procedures set forth in section 7611 or in these questions and answers.

                          Scope of Section 7611

    Q-6: What types of investigations, other than routine requests and 
requests for information necessary to locate and examine third party 
records, and examination of those records, are outside the scope of the 
procedures of section 7611?
    A-6: The church inquiry and examination procedures described in 
section 7611 do not apply to (1) any inquiry or examination relating to 
the tax liability of any person other than a church; (2) any termination 
assessment under section 6851 or 6852, or jeopardy assessment under 
section 6861; or (3) any case involving a knowing failure to file a 
return or a willful attempt to defeat or evade tax (including but not 
limited to any case involving a failure by the church to withhold or pay 
social security or other employment taxes or income tax required to be 
withheld from wages). Additionally, the church inquiry and examination 
procedures do not apply to any criminal investigations.
    The church tax inquiry and examination procedures also do not apply 
to inquiries or examinations which relate primarily to the tax status 
(including, but not limited to, social security or self-employment tax 
or income tax required to be withheld from wages) or liability of 
persons other than the church (including, but not limited to, the tax 
status or liability of a contributor or contributors to the church), 
rather than the tax status or liability of the church itself. These may 
include, but are not limited to: (1) inquiries or examinations regarding 
the inurement of church funds to a particular individual or individuals 
or to another organization, which may result in the denial of all or 
part of such individual's or organization's deduction for charitable 
contributions to a church; (2) inquiries or examinations regarding the 
assignment of income or services or contributions to a church; and (3) 
inquiries or examinations regarding a vow of poverty by an individual or 
individuals followed by a transfer of property or an assignment of 
income or services to a church. Inquiries may be made to a church 
regarding these matters without being considered to have commenced a 
church tax inquiry under section 7611, and an examination of church 
records may be made relating to these issues (including enforcement of a 
summons for access to such records) without application of the 
requirements contained in section 7611 applicable to

[[Page 489]]

church tax inquiries and examinations. Such examinations are subject to 
the general rules regarding examinations of taxpayer books and records.
    Q-7: What action may be taken if the church or its agents fail to 
respond to routine requests, or questions regarding other individuals' 
or organizations' tax liabilities?
    A-7: Repeated (two or more) failures by a church or its agents to 
reply to routine requests (see Q and A-4) will be considered by the 
appropriate Internal Revenue Service Regional Commissioner to be a 
reasonable basis for commencement of a church tax inquiry under the 
church tax inquiry and examination procedures of section 7611. The 
failure of a church to respond to repeated requests for information 
regarding individuals' or other organizations' tax liabilities (see Q 
and A-6) will be considered a reasonable basis for commencement of a 
church tax inquiry. Failure by a church to provide information necessary 
to locate third-party records (see Q and A-5) will be a factor, but not 
a conclusive factor, in determining if there is reasonable cause for 
commencing a church tax inquiry. For this purpose, a failure to respond 
to a request means either that no response has been made or that the 
response does not make a reasonable attempt to submit the information 
called for by the specific language of the request.
    Q-8: Where an inquiry or examination is outside the scope of and 
does not necessitate application of the procedures of section 7611, what 
are the limitations on the Internal Revenue Service's actions?
    A-8: Inquiries or examinations which are outside the scope of the 
procedures of section 7611 and therefore are conducted without 
application of the procedures of section 7611 (for instance, those 
addressed in Q and A-6) will be limited to the determination of facts 
and circumstances specifically relating to the tax liabilities of the 
individuals or other organizations in question. For example, in a case 
against an individual or other organization, information may be 
requested or church records examined, if pertinent, regarding amounts of 
money, property, or services transferred to the individual or 
individuals in question (including, but not limited to wages, loans, or 
noncontractual transfers), the use of church funds for personal 
expenses, or other similar matters, without having to follow the church 
tax inquiry and examination procedures. As one example, in an assignment 
of income case against an individual or other organization, information 
could be requested or church records examined if relevant to an 
individual's assignment of particular income, donation of property, or 
transfer of a business to a church. However, without following the 
church tax inquiry and examination procedures, no examination of a 
contributor or membership list in the possession of the church will be 
made, other than under the applicable procedures of section 7611, for 
the purpose of determining the overall financial structure of the 
church, merely because such structure was relevant to the church's 
qualification as a tax-exempt entity and therefore indirectly relevant 
to the validity of contributors' deductions in general. Inquiries or 
examinations regarding individuals' or other organizations' tax 
liabilities will not be used in a manner inconsistent with the 
procedures set forth in section 7611 or in these questions and answers.

                           Notice Requirements

    Q-9: What satisfies the inquiry notice requirement (first notice) 
upon commencement of a church tax inquiry?
    A-9: Upon commencing a church tax inquiry, the appropriate Regional 
Commissioner is required to provide written notice to the church of the 
beginning of the inquiry. This notice will include (1) an explanation of 
the concerns which gave rise to the inquiry and the general subject 
matter of the inquiry, which is sufficiently specific to allow the 
church to understand the particular area of church activities or 
behavior which is at issue; (2) a general explanation of the provisions 
of the Internal Revenue Code which authorize the inquiry or which may 
otherwise be involved in the inquiry; and (3) a general explanation of 
applicable administrative and constitutional provisions with respect to 
the inquiry, including

[[Page 490]]

the right to a conference with the Internal Revenue Service before an 
examination of church records is commenced. The inquiry notice (first 
notice) will generally request information in an effort to alleviate the 
concerns which gave rise to the inquiry.
    However, the Internal Revenue Service is not precluded from 
expanding its inquiry beyond the concerns expressed in the inquiry 
notice (first notice) as a result of facts and circumstances which 
subsequently comes to its attention (including, where appropriate, an 
expansion of an unrelated business income inquiry to include questions 
of tax-exempt status, and vice-versa).
    The inquiry notice requirement (first notice) does not require the 
Internal Revenue Service to share particular items of evidence with the 
church, or to identify its sources of information regarding church 
activities, if providing such information would be damaging to the 
inquiry or to the sources of information. For example, in an inquiry 
regarding unrelated business income, the Internal Revenue Service might 
state that its inquiry was prompted by a local newspaper advertisement 
regarding a church-owned business. However, the Internal Revenue Service 
would not be required to reveal the existence or identity of any so-
called ``informers'' within a church (including present or former 
employees).
    Q-10: What must be done to satisfy the examination notice 
requirement (second notice) before commencing an examination of church 
records or religious activities with respect to an examination conducted 
under section 7611?
    A-10: Where an examination is conducted under section 7611, church 
records or religious activities of a church may be examined only if, at 
least 15 days prior to the examination, written notice of the proposed 
examination is provided to the church and to the appropriate Regional 
Counsel. This notice is in addition to the notice of commencement of 
inquiry (first notice) previously provided to the church.
    The notice of examination (second notice) is required to include (1) 
a copy of the church tax inquiry notice (first notice) previously 
provided to the church; (2) a description of the church records and 
activities sought to be examined; and (3) a copy of all documents which 
were collected or prepared by the Internal Revenue Service for use in 
the examination, and which are required to be disclosed under the 
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) as supplemented by section 
6103 of the Code (relating to disclosure and confidentiality of tax 
return information). The documents to be supplied under this provision 
will be limited to documents specifically concerning the church whose 
records are to be examined and will not include documents relating to 
other inquiries or examinations or to Internal Revenue Service practices 
and procedures in general. Disclosure to the church will be subject to 
restrictions regarding the disclosure of the existence or identity of 
informants. Although a description of materials to be examined will be 
provided in the notice of examination (second notice), the description 
does not restrict the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to examine 
church records or religious activities which are not specifically 
mentioned in the notice of examination (second notice) but which are 
properly within the scope of the examination. Thus, the Internal Revenue 
Service is not precluded from expanding its inquiry beyond the concerns 
expressed in the examination notice (second notice) as a result of facts 
and circumstances which subsequently come to its attention (including, 
where appropriate, an expansion of an unrelated business income 
examination to include questions of tax-exempt status, and vice versa).
    At the time the notice of examination (second notice) is provided to 
the church, a copy of the same notice will be provided to the 
appropriate Regional Counsel. The Regional Counsel is then allowed 15 
days from issuance of the second notice in which to file an advisory 
objection to the examination. (This is concurrent with the 15-day period 
during which an examination of church records is prohibited pending a 
request for a conference.)
    As part of the notice of examination (second notice), the church 
will be offered an opportunity to meet with an Internal Revenue Service 
official to

[[Page 491]]

discuss the concerns which gave rise to the inquiry and the general 
subject matter of the inquiry. An examination will not begin until 15 
days after the mailing of the notice of examination (second notice). The 
organization may request a conference at any time prior to beginning of 
the examination and a conference so requested will be scheduled within a 
reasonable time after the request is made.
    The purpose of the conference is to remind the church, in general 
terms, of the stages of the church tax inquiry and examination 
procedures and to discuss the relevant issues that may arise as part of 
the inquiry, in an effort to resolve the issues of tax exemption or 
liability without the necessity of an examination of church records or 
activities. Information properly excludable from a written notice of 
examination (second notice) (including information regarding the 
identity of third-party witnesses or evidence provided by such 
witnesses) is not a subject for discussion at, and will not be revealed 
during, a conference.
    Once a conference request is timely made, an examination will begin 
only following the conference. The conference requirement may not be 
utilized to delay an examination beyond the time reasonably necessary to 
prepare for and hold the conference. The holding of one conference with 
the church will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 
7611 and these questions and answers.

                     Action After Issuance of Notice

    Q-11: What action may be taken after issuance of the examination 
notice (second notice)?
    A-11: After the examination notice (second notice) is issued, the 
organization may request a conference as described in Q and A-10 (see Q 
and A-12 with respect to time for issuance of examination notice). If 
the matters of concern which gave rise to the issuance of the 
examination notice (second notice) are resolved at the conference, it 
may be determined that an examination is not necessary. If the matters 
of concern are not resolved at the conference, or if the organization 
does not request a conference, the examination will ordinarily begin.
    The examination will be conducted under the Internal Revenue 
Service's general examination procedures and the procedures of section 
7611. The outcome of such an examination will ordinarily be: (1) No 
change in tax-exempt status or tax liability; (2) no change in such 
status or liability, conditioned on compliance with a request to modify 
in future tax periods matters such as internal accounting practices and 
procedures or coupled with a caution to refrain from increasing certain 
activities limited by the Internal Revenue Code, such as lobbying 
programs aimed at influencing legislation; (3) a proposal to revoke tax-
exempt status; (4) a proposal asserting unrelated business income tax 
liability; or (5) a proposal asserting liability for other taxes.
    In certain exceptional circumstances the Internal Revenue Service 
may, in lieu of an examination, propose to revoke the organization's 
exemption based upon the facts and circumstances which form the basis 
for a reasonable belief to commence an inquiry under section 7611 and 
any other appropriate information that becomes apparent as a result of 
the inquiry, the conference, or both.
    Pursuant to section 7611(d), the Regional Counsel is required to 
approve, in writing, certain final determinations that are within the 
scope of section 7611 and adversely affect tax-exempt status or increase 
any tax liability. The Regional Counsel will review and approve (1) a 
determination that an organization is not entitled to tax-exempt status; 
(2) a determination that an organization is not entitled to receive tax-
deductible contributions; or (3) the issuance of a notice of tax 
deficiency to a church arising out of an inquiry or examination or, in 
cases where deficiency procedures are inapplicable, the assessment of 
any underpayment of tax by the church arising out of an inquiry or 
examination. The Regional Counsel will also state in writing that there 
has been substantial compliance with section 7611, when applicable.

                       Procedural Time Limitations

    Q-12: When may the notice of examination (second notice) be sent?
    A-12. The notice of examination (second notice) may be mailed to a 
church

[[Page 492]]

not less than 15 days after the notice of commencement of a church tax 
inquiry (first notice). Thus, at least 30 days must pass between the 
first notice and the actual examination of church records since an 
examination may not begin until 15 days after the notice of examination 
(second notice). For example, if notice of commencement of an inquiry is 
mailed to a church on March 1st, the notice of proposed examination may 
be mailed to the church no earlier than the 15th day after the date of 
the inquiry notice, or March 16th. If the notice of examination (second 
notice) was mailed March 16th, no examination of church records may be 
made prior to day 30; thus, the earliest date the examination may 
commence is March 31st. If an organization does not request a conference 
prior to day 30, the Internal Revenue Service may proceed to examine 
church records and complete its investigation or make a determination 
based on the information already in its possession.
    Q-13: What is the limitation on the amount of time the Internal 
Revenue Service has to complete inquiries and examinations?
    A-13: The Internal Revenue Service is required to complete any 
church inquiry or examination, and to make a final determination with 
respect thereto, not later than two years after the date on which the 
notice of examination (second notice) is mailed to the church. The 
running of this two-year period is suspended for any period during which 
(1) a judicial proceeding brought by the church or its officials or 
agents against the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the church 
tax inquiry or examination is pending or being appealed (even though 
section 7611(e)(2) describes the exclusive remedy for a violation of the 
church tax inquiry and examination procedures; see Q and A-17); (2) a 
judicial proceeding brought by the Internal Revenue Service against the 
church (or any official or agent thereof) to compel compliance with any 
reasonable request for examination of church records or religious 
activities is pending or being appealed; or (3) the Internal Revenue 
Service is unable to take actions with respect to the church tax inquiry 
or examination by reason of an order issued in a suit under section 7609 
involving access to records held by third-party recordkeepers. The two-
year period is also suspended for any period in excess of 20 days (but 
not in excess of 6 months) in which the church or its agents fail to 
comply with any reasonable request for church records or other 
information. The two-year period may be extended by mutual agreement of 
the church and the Internal Revenue Service.
    In cases where the inquiry is not followed by an examination notice 
(second notice), the inquiry must be concluded and a final determination 
made within 90 days of the date of the notice of inquiry (first notice). 
This 90-day period is suspended during any period for which the two year 
period for duration of a church examination would be suspended; except 
that the 90-day period will not be suspended because of the church's 
failure to comply with requests for information made prior to the notice 
of examination (second notice).
    Q-13a: When do the church tax inquiry and church tax examination 
periods commence and conclude?
    A-13a: A church tax inquiry commences when the church tax inquiry 
notice (first notice) is mailed. A church tax inquiry must be concluded 
not later than 90 days after the church tax inquiry notice (first 
notice) date. The period is counted from the day after the inquiry 
notice (first notice) is mailed. A church tax inquiry is concluded when 
the results of the inquiry or the notice of examination, as appropriate, 
is mailed. For example, if the inquiry notice (first notice) is mailed 
on November 1, 1985, the church tax inquiry must be concluded, in the 
absence of a permissible suspension of the period (see Q and A-13), on 
or before January 30, 1986.
    A church tax examination commences when the church tax examination 
notice (second notice) is mailed. A church tax examination must be 
concluded not later than the date which is 2 years after the examination 
notice (second notice) date. The period is counted from the day after 
the examination notice (second notice) is mailed. A church tax 
examination is

[[Page 493]]

concluded when the final determination is mailed. For example, if the 
examination notice is mailed November 16, 1985, the final determination 
must be made, in the absence of a permissible suspension of the period 
(see Q and A-13), on or before November 16, 1987.

             Examination of Records or Religious Activities

    Q-14: To what extent may church records or religious activities of a 
church be examined?
    A-14: In cases conducted under section 7611, an examination of 
church records may be made only after complying with the notice 
provisions of section 7611 (see Qs and As 9, 10 and 12) unless the 
church files a written waiver of the provisions of section 7611 or a 
part thereof. In cases conducted under section 7611 where no written 
waiver has been filed, church records may be examined only to the extent 
necessary to determine the liability for, and the amount of, any Federal 
tax. This includes examinations (1) to determine the initial or 
continuing qualification of the organization whose records are being 
examined as a tax-exempt church under section 501(c)(3); (2) to 
determine whether the organization qualifies to receive tax-deductible 
contributions under section 170(c); or (3) to determine the amount of 
tax (including unrelated business income tax), if any, which is to be 
imposed on the organization.
    Church records include all regularly kept church corporate and 
financial records including (but not limited to) corporate minute books, 
contributor or membership lists, and any materials which qualified as 
church books of account under section 7605(c), as in effect on December 
31, 1984. Church records include private correspondence between a church 
and its members that is in the possession of the church. However, church 
records do not include records previously filed with a public official 
or newspapers or newsletters distributed generally to church members.
    The religious activities of an organization claiming to be a church 
(see Q and A-3 for a definition of the term ``church'' as used in 
section 7611 and in these questions and answers) may be examined only to 
the extent necessary to determine if the organization actually is a 
church exempt from tax. This includes a determination of the 
organization's qualification as a church for any period.

   Limitations on Period of Assessment or Proceedings for Collection 
                           Without Assessment

    Q-15: What are the special limitations on the period of assessment 
or proceedings for collection without assessment?
    A-15: The special limitation periods for church tax liabilities are 
described below and are not be to construed to increase an otherwise 
applicable limitation period. Thus, a three-year limitation period would 
apply where a church filed a tax return before an examination was held 
and did not substantially understate income. No limitation period is to 
apply in any case of fraud, willful tax evasion, or knowing failure to 
file a return which should have been filed.
    In the case of any church tax examination with respect to the 
revocation of tax-exempt status under section 501(a), any tax imposed by 
chapter 1 (other than section 511) may be assessed, or a proceeding in 
court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, only 
for the three most recently completed taxable years preceding the 
examination notice date (i.e., the date the notice of examination is 
mailed to the church). If an organization is not a church exempt from 
tax under section 501(a) for any of the three years described in the 
preceding sentence, then the period of assessment will apply to the six 
most recently completed taxable years ending before the examination 
notice date.
    For examinations concerning qualification for tax-exempt status, the 
examination is limited initially to an examination of church records 
which are relevant to a determination of tax status or liability for the 
three most recently completed taxable years ending before the 
examination notice date. If it is determined that an organization is not 
a church exempt from tax for one or more of the three most recently 
completed taxable years and no return

[[Page 494]]

has been filed for the three years ending before the three most recently 
completed taxable years, an examination of relevant records may be made, 
as part of the same examination, for the six most recently completed 
taxable years ending before the examination notice date. (This assumes 
that no returns were filed for any of the three years to which the 
examination is to be extended. If a return was timely filed for any such 
year, the filing of that return determines the applicable statute of 
limitations for that year in the absence of other factors, for example, 
fraud, willful tax evasion or substantial understatement, which 
ordinarily would extend the statute of limitations.)
    For purposes of section 7611(d)(2)(A) and this question and answer, 
an organization is determined not to be a church exempt from tax for one 
or more of the three most recently completed taxable years ending before 
the examination notice date, when the appropriate Regional Commissioner 
approves, in writing, the completed findings of the examining agent that 
the organization is not a church exempt from tax for one or more of such 
years. Such approval may not be delegated by the Regional Commissioner 
to a subordinate official. The completed findings of the examining 
agent, as approved by the appropriate Regional Commissioner for this 
purpose, do not constitute a final revenue agent's report under section 
7611(g).
    Church records of a year earlier than the third or sixth completed 
taxable year, as applicable, may be examined if material to a 
determination of tax-exempt status during the applicable three or six 
year period.
    For examinations concerning unrelated business taxable income, where 
no return has been filed by the church, tax may be assessed or collected 
for the six most recently completed taxable years ending before the 
examination notice date. Church records of a year earlier than the sixth 
year may be examined if material to a determination of unrelated 
business income tax liability during the six year period.
    For examinations involving issues other than revocation of exempt 
status or unrelated business income (e.g., examinations relating to 
social security or other employment taxes), no limitation period is to 
apply if no return has been filed.
    The applicable limitation period may be extended by mutual agreement 
of the church and the Internal Revenue Service.

                          Multiple Examinations

    Q-16: What are the special multiple examination rules applicable to 
churches?
    A-16: The Assistant Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt 
Organizations) is required to approve, in writing, any second inquiry or 
examination of a church, if the second inquiry or examination is to be 
undertaken within five years of an earlier inquiry or examination and if 
the earlier inquiry or examination did not result in either (1) 
revocation of tax exemption, notice of deficiency or an assessment of 
tax, or (2) a request for any significant changes in church operational 
practices (including the adequacy or sufficiency of records maintained 
to reflect income). The Assistant Commissioner's approval is required 
only if the second inquiry or examination involves the same or similar 
issues as the earlier inquiry or examination. The 5-year period is 
counted from the examination notice date of the earlier examination or, 
if no notice of examination was mailed, the inquiry notice date of the 
earlier examination. This 5-year period is to be suspended for periods 
during which the two-year period for completion of an examination is 
suspended (as described in Q and A-13) unless the prior examination was 
actually concluded within 2 years of the notice of examination.
    In determining whether the second church tax inquiry or examination 
involves the same or similar issues as the preceding inquiry or 
examination, the substantive factual issues involved in the two 
examinations, rather than legal classifications, will govern. For 
example, where a prior examination and a current examination of 
unrelated business income involve income from different sources, the 
current examination involves different issues than the prior examination 
and the approval of the Assistant Commissioner (Employee

[[Page 495]]

Plans and Exempt Organizations) is not necessary.

                  Remedy for Violations of Section 7611

    Q-17: What remedy is available for a violation of the church inquiry 
and examination procedures?
    A-17: The exclusive remedy for any Internal Revenue Service 
violation of the church tax inquiry and examination procedures is as 
follows: Failure to comply substantially with the requirements that (1) 
two notices be sent to the church; (2) the Regional Commissioner approve 
the commencement of a church tax inquiry; or (3) an offer of a 
conference with the church be made (and a conference held if timely 
requested), will result in a stay of proceedings in a summons proceeding 
to gain access to church records (but not in dismissal of such 
proceeding), until these requirements are satisfied. The two-year 
limitation on duration of a church tax examination will not be suspended 
during stays of summons proceedings resulting from violations described 
above; however, violations may be corrected without regard to the 
otherwise applicable time limits prescribed under the procedures of 
section 7611. In determining whether a stay is necessary, a court must 
consider the good faith effort of the Internal Revenue Service and the 
effect of any violation of the proper examination procedures.
    Section 7611(e)(2) provides that no suit may be maintained and no 
defense may be raised, other than a stay in a summons enforcement 
proceeding, by reason of any noncompliance with the requirements of 
section 7611. Thus, failure to comply with any of these requirements may 
not be raised as a defense or affirmative ground for relief in any 
judicial proceeding including, but not limited to, a summons proceeding 
to gain access to church records; a declaratory judgment proceeding 
involving a determination of tax-exempt status under section 7428; a 
proceeding to collect unpaid tax; or a deficiency or refund proceeding. 
Additionally, failure to substantially comply with the requirements that 
two notices be sent, that the Regional Commissioner approve an inquiry, 
and that a conference be offered (and the conference held if requested) 
may not be raised as a defense or as an affirmative ground for relief in 
a summons proceeding or any other judicial proceeding other than as 
specifically set forth above. Therefore, a church or its representatives 
will not be able to litigate the issue of the reasonableness of the 
appropriate Regional Commissioner's belief in approving the commencement 
of a church tax inquiry (i.e., that the church may not be tax-exempt or 
may be engaged in taxable activities) in a summons proceeding or any 
other judicial proceeding. The church retains the right to raise any 
substantive or procedural argument which would be available to taxpayers 
generally in an appropriate proceeding.

                             Effective Date

    Q-18: What is the effective date of the church examination 
procedures?
    A-18: The procedures set forth in section 7611 apply to all tax 
inquiries and examinations beginning after December 31, 1984. The 
procedures of section 7605 will apply to any examination commenced 
before January 1, 1985. Any activities commenced after December 31, 
1984, that would constitute a new inquiry or new examination must comply 
with the procedures of section 7611.

Commissioner has designated are authorized to administer such oaths or 
affirmations and to certify to such papers as may be necessary under the 
internal revenue laws or regulations issued thereunder, except that the 
authority to certify shall not be construed as applying to those papers 
or documents the certification of which is authorized by separate order 
or directive.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7623-1   Rewards for information relating to violations of internal revenue laws.

    (a) In general. A district director may approve such reward as he 
deems suitable for information that leads to the detection and 
punishment of any person guilty of violating any internal revenue law, 
or conniving at the same. The rewards provided for by section 7623 are 
limited in their aggregate to the sum appropriated therefor and shall be 
paid only in cases not otherwise provided for by law.
    (b) Eligibility to file claim for reward--(1) In general. Any 
person, other than certain present or former federal employees (see 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph), who submits, in the manner set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section, information relating to the 
violation of an internal revenue law is eligible to file a claim for 
reward under section 7623.
    (2) Federal employees. No person who was an officer or employee of 
the Department of the Treasury at the time he came into possession of 
information relating to violations of the internal revenue laws, or at 
the time he divulged such information, shall be eligible for reward 
under section 7623 and this section. Any other Federal employee, or 
former Federal employee, is eligible to file a claim for reward if the 
information submitted came to his knowledge other than in the course of 
his official duties.
    (3) Deceased informants. A claim for reward may be filed by an 
executor, administrator, or other legal representative on behalf of a 
deceased informant if, prior to his death, the informant was eligible to 
file a claim for such reward under section 7623 and this section. 
Certified copies of the letters testamentary, letters of administration, 
or other similar evidence must be annexed to such a claim for reward on 
behalf of a deceased informant in order to show the authority of the 
legal representative to file the claim for reward.
    (c) Amount and payment of reward. All relevant factors, including 
the value of the information furnished in relation to the facts 
developed by the investigation of the violation, shall be taken into 
account by a district director in determining whether a reward shall be 
paid, and, if so, the amount thereof. The amount of a reward shall 
represent what the district director deems to be adequate compensation 
in the particular case, normally not to exceed 10 percent of the 
additional taxes, penalties, and fines which are recovered as a result 
of the information. No reward however, shall be paid with respect to any 
additional interest that may be collected. Payment of a reward will be 
made as promptly as the circumstances of the case permit, but generally 
not until the taxes, penalties, or fines involved have been collected. 
However, the informant may waive any claim for reward with respect to an 
uncollected portion of the taxes, penalties, or fines involved, in which 
case the claim may be immediately processed. No person is authorized 
under these regulations to make any offer, or promise, or otherwise to 
bind a district director with respect to the payment of any reward or 
the amount thereof.
    (d) Submission of information. Persons desiring to claim rewards 
under the provisions of section 7623 and this section may submit 
information relating to violations of the internal revenue laws, in 
person, to the Office of the Director of the Intelligence Division, 
Washington, DC 20224 or to the office of a district director, preferably 
to a representative of the Intelligence Division thereof. Such 
information may also be submitted in writing to the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue, Attention:

[[Page 497]]

Director, Intelligence Division, Washington, DC 20224 or to any district 
director, Attention: Chief, Intelligence Division. If the information is 
submitted in person, either orally or in writing, the name and official 
title of the person to whom it is submitted and the date on which it is 
submitted must be included in the formal claim for reward.
    (e) Anonymity. No unauthorized person shall be advised of the 
identity of an informant.
    (f) Filing claim for reward. An informant who intends to claim a 
reward under section 7623 should notify the person to whom he submits 
his information of such intention, and must file a formal claim, signed 
with his true name, as soon after submission of the information as 
practicable. If other than the informant's true name was used in 
furnishing the information, the claimant must include with his claim 
satisfactory proof of his identity as that of the informant. Claim for 
reward under the provisions of section 7623 shall be made on Form 211, 
which may be obtained form the offices of the district directors, or 
from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. A claim 
for reward should be transmitted to the district director, Attention: 
Informant's Claim Examiner, or to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 
Attention: Director, Intelligence Division, Washington, DC 20224.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7624-1  Reimbursement to State and local law enforcement agencies.

    (a) In general. The Internal Revenue Service may reimburse a State 
or local law enforcement agency for expenses, such as salaries, overtime 
pay, per diem, and similar reasonable expenses, incurred in an 
investigation in which information is furnished to the Service that 
substantially contributes to the recovery of Federal taxes imposed with 
respect to illegal drug or related money laundering activities. The 
amount of reimbursement that may be paid shall not exceed the limits 
specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section.
    (b) Information that substantially contributes to recovery of 
taxes--(1) Definition. The Service generally will consider that 
information furnished by a State or local law enforcement agency 
substantially contributed to the recovery of taxes with respect to 
illegal drug or related money laundering activities provided the 
information was not already in the possession of the Service at the time 
the information is furnished by the State or local law enforcement 
agency, and
    (i) Concerns a taxpayer who is not under examination or 
investigation by the Service at the time the information is furnished or 
has not already been selected by the Service for examination or 
investigation in the near future, or
    (ii) Concerns a taxpayer who is under examination or has been 
selected for examination at the time the information is furnished but 
the information furnished would not normally have been discovered in the 
course of an ordinary investigation or examination by the Service. Also, 
information will generally be considered as substantially contributing 
to the recovery of taxes if it leads to the discovery of hidden assets 
owned by the taxpayer which are used to satisfy the taxpayer's assessed 
but otherwise uncollectable Federal tax liability with respect to 
illegal drug or related money laundering activities.

For purposes of this paragraph (b), information includes, but is not 
limited to, tax years of violations, aliases, addresses, social security 
numbers and/or employer identification numbers, financial data (bank 
accounts, assets, etc.) and their location, and any documentation that 
substantiates allegations concerning tax liability (books and records) 
and its location.
    (2) Examples:

    Example 1. A local police department's narcotics division has been 
gathering information on a suspected local drug dealer for approximately 
six months. Because this person is very cautious when handling 
narcotics, the local police have been unsuccessful in catching this 
person in possession of drugs. Rather than drop the case, the narcotics 
detective turns over to the local IRS Criminal Investigation Division 
(CID) office information concerning this person. At the time the

[[Page 498]]

information is furnished, the Service is unaware of this person's 
suspected involvement in drugs and has no reason to suspect that this 
person's Federal income tax returns are incorrect. Upon examination of 
this person's returns for three open years, the Service determines that 
additional Federal income taxes and civil penalties of approximately 
$20,000 per year are due because of unreported income from drug dealing. 
Because the taxpayer was not under examination and was not reasonably 
anticipated to have been examined prior to receipt of the information, 
the Service will consider that the information furnished by the local 
police department substantially contributed to the recovery of 
approximately $60,000 in taxes with respect to illegal drug activities.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as example 1 except that at the 
time the information is turned over to the Service, the Service was 
already aware of the extent of this person's involvement in drug 
dealing, either through information developed in the course of 
examinations of other taxpayers or through information received from 
other sources, and had already selected this person's returns for 
examination although the person had not yet been contacted by the 
Service. In this case, the information provided by the local police 
department did not substantially contribute to the recovery of taxes 
from this person because the information was already known to the 
Service.
    Example 3. A state or local police officer is conducting ordinary 
traffic patrol. The officer stops a vehicle for speeding and reckless 
driving. The officer recognizes the driver as a known narcotics dealer. 
In the vehicle is a brief case containing $75,000 in cash, but no trace 
of narcotics is found. The driver claims the cash was won in a high 
stakes poker game. The officer arrests the driver for traffic violations 
and takes the briefcase into custody for safe keeping. The local police 
department cannot seize the money because they cannot tie it to a 
narcotics transaction. Instead, they immediately inform the local CID 
office of their find. At the time this information is furnished to the 
Service, there is an unpaid assessed liability of $300,000 in Federal 
taxes and penalties owed by the dealer with respect to illegal drug 
activities that the Service has been unable to collect. Therefore, the 
Service immediately seizes the $75,000 in cash in partial payment of the 
tax liability. The Service will consider that the information furnished 
by the police department substantially contributed to the recovery of 
$75,000 in taxes with respect to drug related activities.
    Example 4. Through information furnished by a reliable informant, a 
local police department learns that a known racketeer and suspected drug 
dealer maintains a second set of books and records in a safe at home. 
The local police obtain a search warrant and find a set of books 
revealing that this person has been using a legitimate business 
operation to launder money derived from both prostitution and drug 
dealing. At the time these records are turned over to the local CID 
office, the taxpayer is already under examination for tax evasion. 
However, based on the information contained in this second set of books, 
the Service is able to collect additional taxes and civil penalties in 
the amount of $1 million in connection with these illegal activities. 
The Service will consider that this information substantially 
contributed to the recovery of $1 million in taxes with respect to money 
laundering in connection with illegal drug activities because, even 
though the taxpayer was already under examination, the information 
provided by the local police would normally not have been discovered by 
the Service in the course of an ordinary investigation.

    (c) Application for reimbursement. An agency that intends to apply 
for reimbursement under the provisions of this section must indicate 
this intent to the Service at the time the information is first provided 
to the Service. A final application for reimbursement of expenses must 
be submitted on Form 211A, State or Local Law Enforcement Application 
for Reimbursement, to the Chief, Criminal Investigation Division of the 
Internal Revenue Service district in which the taxpayer is located. 
Copies of Forms 9061, DAG-71, or other claim for an equitable share of 
asset forfeitures in the case must also be furnished with Form 211A.
    (d) Time for filing application for reimbursement. An application 
for reimbursement may be filed by an agency at the time the information 
is first provided or as soon as practicable after submitting information 
to the Service. However, it must be filed not later than 30 days after 
the Service notifies the agency pursuant to section 7624(b) of the 
amount of taxes collected as a result of the information provided. If an 
application for reimbursement is filed by more than one agency with 
respect to taxes recovered from a taxpayer, the Service will use 
discretion in determining an equitable amount of reimbursement allocated 
to each agency based on all relevant factors. In no event, however, 
shall the aggregate of the amounts paid by the Service to two or more 
agencies exceed the amount specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section.

[[Page 499]]

    (e) Amount and payment of reimbursement--(1) De minimis rule. No 
reimbursement shall be paid under section 7624 or this section to a 
State or local law enforcement agency in any case where the taxes 
recovered total less than $50,000.
    (2) Taxes recovered. For purposes of section 7624 and this section, 
the terms ``taxes'' recovered and ``sum'' recovered mean additional 
Federal taxes, civil penalties, and additions to tax collected (less any 
subsequent refund to the taxpayer) with respect to illegal drug or 
related money laundering activities, but not additional interest or 
criminal fines that may be collected.
    (3) Limitation on reimbursement. The amount of reimbursement payable 
under section 7624 and this section shall not exceed 10 percent of any 
taxes recovered.
    (4) No duplicate reimbursement. A State or local law emforcement 
agency shall not receive reimbursement under section 7624 or this 
section for any expenses incurred in the investigation of a taxpayer 
which have been or will be reimbursed under any other program or 
arrangement including, but not limited to, Federal or State forfeiture 
programs, State revenue laws, or Federal and State equitable sharing 
arrangements.
    (5) Time of payment. No payment of any reimbursement under this 
section will be made to a State or local law enforcement agency before 
the later of final expiration of the applicable period of limitations 
for filing a claim for refund by the taxpayer of the taxes recovered as 
provided in subchapter B of chapter 66 of the Code or the determination 
of the taxpayer's tax liability, as defined in section 1313(a). However, 
reimbursement may be made earlier but only if the agency provides 
adequate indemnification against loss by the Service due to a refund to 
the taxpayer of Federal taxes recovered.
    (6) Applicability. The provisions of section 7624 apply only to 
State and local law enforcement agencies within the United States and 
the District of Columbia.
    (f) Effective date. This section applies with respect to information 
first provided to the Service by a State or local law enforcement agency 
after February 16, 1989.

Sec. 301.7654-1   Coordination of U.S. and Guam individual income taxes.

    (a) Application of section--(1) Scope. Section 7654 and this section 
set forth the general procedures to be followed by the Government of the 
United States and the Government of Guam in the division between the two 
governments of revenue derived from collections of the income taxes 
imposed for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, with 
respect to any individual described in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph (a), and paragraph (e) of this section. To the extent that 
section 7654 and this section are inconsistent with the provisions of 
section 30 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421h), relating to 
duties and taxes to be covered into the treasury of Guam and held in 
account for the Government of Guam, such section 30 is superseded.
    (2) Individuals covered. Paragraph (b) of this section applies only 
to an individual who, for a taxable year, is described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) and has 
(or in the case of a joint return, such individual and his spouse 
have)--

[[Page 500]]

    (i) Adjusted gross income of $50,000 or more, and
    (ii) Gross income of $5,000 or more from sources within the 
jurisdiction (either the United States or Guam) other than the 
jurisdiction with which the individual is required to file his income 
tax return under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter.

For the determination of gross income and adjusted gross income see 
sections 61 and 62, and the regulations thereunder, or, when applicable, 
the corresponding provisions as made applicable in Guam by the Guam 
Territorial income tax (48 U.S.C. 1421i). For purposes of this 
paragraph, gross income consisting of compensation for military or naval 
service shall be taken into account notwithstanding section 514 of the 
Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574). 
However, see paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Allocation of tax. (1) Net collections of income taxes imposed 
for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, with respect to 
each individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for such 
year shall be divided between the United States and Guam by the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Commissioner of Revenue and 
Taxation of Guam as follows:
    (i) Net collections attributable to income from sources within the 
United States shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States.
    (ii) Net collections attributable to income from sources within Guam 
shall be covered into the treasury of Guam, and
    (iii) Net collections not described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of 
this subparagraph (i.e., net collections attributable to income from 
sources other than within the United States or Guam) shall be covered 
into the treasury of the jurisdiction (either the United States or Guam) 
with which the individual is required to file his return under paragraph 
(b) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter for such year.
    (2) The amount of tax of any individual for a taxable year which 
shall be allocated to Guam for purposes of determining the portion of 
the net collections from such individual which shall be covered into the 
treasury of Guam by the United States for such year shall be that amount 
which bears the same ratio to such amount of tax as the adjusted gross 
income of that individual for such year which is allocable to sources in 
Guam bears to the total adjusted gross income of such individual for 
such year. For purposes of such allocation by the United States, the 
adjusted gross income of the taxpayer shall be determined by taking into 
account any compensation of any member of the Armed Forces for services 
performed in Guam the withheld tax on which is paid into the treasury of 
Guam pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The amount of tax of any 
individual for any taxable year which shall be allocated to the United 
States for purposes of determining the portion of the net collections 
from such individual which shall be covered into the Treasury of the 
United States by Guam for such year shall be that amount which bears the 
same ratio to such amount of tax as the adjusted gross income of that 
individual for such year which is allocable to sources in the United 
States bears to the total adjusted gross income of such individual for 
such year.
    (c) Definitions and special rules. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Net collections. (i) In determining net collections for a 
taxable year, appropriate adjustment between the two jurisdictions shall 
be made on a proportionate basis for underpayments of income taxes for 
such taxable year, credits allowed against the income tax for such 
taxable year (other than the credit for taxes withheld under section 
3402 on wages), and refunds made of income taxes paid with respect to 
such taxable year. Thus, if a net operating loss results in a carryback 
to an earlier taxable year which gives rise to a refund for that earlier 
year, an adjustment must be made based upon the proportion which the 
amount of tax covered by one jurisdiction into the treasury of the other 
jurisdiction for that earlier year bears to the total amount of tax paid 
for that earlier year, even though the loss may have resulted from 
activities in one jurisdiction and the income, against which the loss 
was offset, was

[[Page 501]]

earned in the other jurisdiction. Similar adjustments must be made for 
foreign tax credit carrybacks even though different jurisdictions are 
involved. If, for example, an individual pays income tax of $30,000 to 
the United States for 1974 and $10,000 of such tax is covered into the 
treasury of Guam, and if for 1975 such individual has a net operating 
loss attributable to a trade or business carried on in the United States 
which loss is carried back to 1974 and gives rise to a refund of $15,000 
by the United States, Guam must cover into the Treasury of the United 
States the amount of $5,000 which is the adjustment based upon the 
refund ($15,000 x $10,000/$30,000=$5,000).
    (ii) Tax withheld from the compensation of any member of the Armed 
Forces described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section which is paid to 
Guam pursuant to section 7654(d) and paragraph (e) of this section shall 
be taken into account in determining the amount required to be covered 
into the treasury of Guam under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, any underpayment of tax is 
treated as attributable on a pro rata basis to income from sources 
within the United States, Guam, and sources other than within the United 
States or Guam, respectively, and is divided between the United States 
and Guam under the rules in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Income taxes. The term ``income taxes'' means--
    (i) With respect to taxes imposed by the United States, the income 
taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, and
    (ii) With respect to taxes imposed by Guam, the Guam Territorial 
income tax (48 U.S.C. 1421i).
    (3) Source rules. The determination of the source of income shall be 
based on the principles contained in sections 861 through 863, and the 
regulations thereunder, or, when applicable, in those sections as made 
applicable in Guam by the Guam Territorial income tax. For such purposes 
the provisions of section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief 
Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574) relating to the determination of the 
source of income of members of the Armed Forces shall not be taken into 
account. For purposes of this subparagraph, the provisions in section 
935(c) treating Guam as part of the United States, and vice versa, do 
not apply. For definition of the terms ``United States'' and ``Guam'' 
(see section 7701(a)(9) of the Code and section 2 of the Organic Act of 
Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421).
    (d) Information return. Each individual described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section for a taxable year who is required by paragraph 
(b)(1) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter to file his return of income for 
such year with the United States shall timely file a properly executed 
Form 5074 (Allocation of Individual Income Tax to Guam) by attaching 
such form to his income tax return. Each individual described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section for a taxable year who is required by 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter to file his return of 
income for such year with Guam shall timely file such information as may 
be required by the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation with respect to 
his income derived from sources within the United States. See section 
6688 and Sec. 301.6688-1 for the penalty for failure to comply with this 
paragraph.
    (e) Military personnel in Guam. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
shall arrange to pay to Guam the amount of the taxes deducted and 
withheld by the United States under section 3402 from wages paid to 
members of the Armed Forces who are stationed in Guam but who have no 
income tax liability to Guam with respect to such wages by reason of 
section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 
App. U.S.C. 574). Section 514 of that Act provides in effect that for 
purposes of the taxation of income by Guam a person shall not be deemed 
to have lost a residence or domicile in the United States solely by 
reason of being absent therefrom in compliance with military or naval 
orders and the compensation for military or naval service of such a 
person who is not a resident of, or domiciled in, Guam shall not be 
deemed income for services performed within, or from sources within, 
Guam. Any amount paid to Guam under this paragraph in respect of a 
member of

[[Page 502]]

the Armed Forces described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be 
taken into account in determining the amount required to be covered into 
the treasury of Guam under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the term ``Armed Forces of the United 
States'' has the meaning provided by Sec. 301.7701-8 of this chapter. 
This paragraph does not apply to wages for services performed in Guam by 
members of the Armed Forces of the United States which are not 
compensation for military or naval service. In determining the amount of 
tax to be covered into the treasury of Guam under this paragraph with 
respect to remuneration for services performed in Guam by members of the 
Armed Forces of the United States, the special procedure agreed upon 
with the Department of Defense in 1951 shall not apply to remuneration 
paid after December 31, 1974. Under that procedure the tax withheld 
under section 3402 upon such remuneration for services performed in Guam 
during April and October of each year was to be projected for the 
appropriate six-month period of which the base month is a part, thereby 
arriving at an estimated figure for semiannual withholding tax to be 
covered over.
    (f) Transfers of funds. The transfers of funds between the United 
States and Guam required to effectuate the provisions of this section 
shall be made when convenient for the two governments, but not less 
frequently than once in each calendar year. In complying with paragraph 
(b) of this section, only net balances will be transferred between the 
two governments. Further, amounts transferred pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section may be determined on the basis of estimates rather than 
the actual amounts derived from information furnished by taxpayers, 
except that the net collections for 1973 and every third calendar year 
thereafter are to be transferred on the basis of the information 
furnished by taxpayers pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In 
order to facilitate the transfer of funds pursuant to this section, the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Commissioner of Revenue and 
Taxation of Guam shall exchange such information, including copies of 
income tax returns, as will ensure that the provisions of section 7654 
and this section are being properly implemented.

Sec. 301.7701-1  Classification of organizations for federal tax purposes.

    (a) Organizations for federal tax purposes--(1) In general. The 
Internal Revenue Code prescribes the classification of various 
organizations for federal tax purposes. Whether an organization is an 
entity separate from its owners for federal tax purposes is a matter of 
federal tax law and does not depend on whether the organization is 
recognized as an entity under local law.
    (2) Certain joint undertakings give rise to entities for federal tax 
purposes. A joint venture or other contractual arrangement may create a 
separate entity for federal tax purposes if the participants carry on a 
trade, business, financial operation, or venture and divide the profits 
therefrom. For example, a separate entity exists for federal tax 
purposes if co- owners of an apartment building lease space and in 
addition provide services to the occupants either directly or through an 
agent. Nevertheless, a joint undertaking merely to share expenses does 
not create a separate entity for federal tax purposes. For example, if 
two or more persons jointly construct a ditch merely to drain surface 
water from their properties, they have not created a separate entity for 
federal tax purposes. Similarly, mere co-ownership of property that is 
maintained, kept in repair, and rented or leased does not constitute a 
separate entity for federal tax purposes. For example, if an individual 
owner, or tenants in common, of farm property lease it to a farmer for a 
cash rental or a share of the crops, they do not necessarily create a 
separate entity for federal tax purposes.
    (3) Certain local law entities not recognized. An entity formed 
under local law is not always recognized as a separate entity for 
federal tax purposes. For example, an organization wholly owned by a 
State is not recognized as a separate entity for federal tax purposes if 
it

[[Page 503]]

is an integral part of the State. Similarly, tribes incorporated under 
section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, as amended, 25 
U.S.C. 477, or under section 3 of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, as 
amended, 25 U.S.C. 503, are not recognized as separate entities for 
federal tax purposes.
    (4) Single owner organizations. Under Secs. 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-
3, certain organizations that have a single owner can choose to be 
recognized or disregarded as entities separate from their owners.
    (b) Classification of organizations. The classification of 
organizations that are recognized as separate entities is determined 
under Secs. 301.7701-2, 301.7701-3, and 301.7701-4 unless a provision of 
the Internal Revenue Code (such as section 860A addressing Real Estate 
Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMICs)) provides for special treatment of 
that organization. For the classification of organizations as trusts, 
see Sec. 301.7701-4. That section provides that trusts generally do not 
have associates or an objective to carry on business for profit. 
Sections 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 provide rules for classifying 
organizations that are not classified as trusts.
    (c) Qualified cost sharing arrangements. A qualified cost sharing 
arrangement that is described in Sec. 1.482-7 of this chapter and any 
arrangement that is treated by the Commissioner as a qualified cost 
sharing arrangement under Sec. 1.482-7 of this chapter is not recognized 
as a separate entity for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. See 
Sec. 1.482-7 of this chapter for the proper treatment of qualified cost 
sharing arrangements.
    (d) Domestic and foreign entities. For purposes of this section and 
Secs. 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3, an entity is a domestic entity if it is 
created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United 
States or of any State; an entity is foreign if it is not domestic. See 
sections 7701(a)(4) and (a)(5).
    (e) State. For purposes of this section and Sec. 301.7701-2, the 
term State includes the District of Columbia.
    (f) Effective date. The rules of this section are effective as of 
January 1, 1997.

Sec. 301.7701-2  Business entities; definitions.

    (a) Business entities. For purposes of this section and 
Sec. 301.7701-3, a business entity is any entity recognized for federal 
tax purposes (including an entity with a single owner that may be 
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Sec. 301.7701-3) 
that is not properly classified as a trust under Sec. 301.7701-4 or 
otherwise subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. 
A business entity with two or more members is classified for federal tax 
purposes as either a corporation or a partnership. A business entity 
with only one owner is classified as a corporation or is disregarded; if 
the entity is disregarded, its activities are treated in the same manner 
as a sole proprietorship, branch, or division of the owner.
    (b) Corporations. For federal tax purposes, the term corporation 
means--
    (1) A business entity organized under a Federal or State statute, or 
under a statute of a federally recognized Indian tribe, if the statute 
describes or refers to the entity as incorporated or as a corporation, 
body corporate, or body politic;
    (2) An association (as determined under Sec. 301.7701-3);
    (3) A business entity organized under a State statute, if the 
statute describes or refers to the entity as a joint-stock company or 
joint-stock association;
    (4) An insurance company;
    (5) A State-chartered business entity conducting banking activities, 
if any of its deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq., or a similar federal statute;
    (6) A business entity wholly owned by a State or any political 
subdivision thereof;
    (7) A business entity that is taxable as a corporation under a 
provision of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 7701(a)(3); 
and

    (ii) Exceptions in certain cases. The following entities will not be 
treated as corporations under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section:
    (A) With regard to Canada, any corporation or company formed under 
any federal or provincial law which provides that the liability of all 
of the members of such corporation or company will be unlimited; and
    (B) With regard to India, a company deemed to be a public limited 
company solely by operation of Section 43A(1) (relating to corporate 
ownership of the company), section 43A(1A) (relating to annual average 
turnover), or section 43A(1B) (relating to ownership interests in other 
companies) of the Companies Act, 1956 (or any combination of these), 
provided that the organizational documents of such deemed public limited 
company continue to meet the requirements of section 3(1)(iii) of the 
Companies Act, 1956.
    (iii) Public companies. With regard to Cyprus, Hong Kong, Jamaica, 
and Trinidad and Tobago, the term public limited company includes any 
limited company which is not a private limited company under the laws of 
those jurisdictions.
    (iv) Limited companies. Any reference to a limited company (whether 
public or private) in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section includes, as 
the case may be, companies limited by shares and companies limited by 
guarantee.
    (v) Multilingual countries. Different linguistic renderings of the 
name of an entity listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section shall be 
disregarded. For example, an entity formed under the laws of Switzerland 
as a Societe Anonyme will be a corporation and

[[Page 505]]

treated in the same manner as an Aktiengesellschaft.
    (c) Other business entities. For federal tax purposes--
    (1) The term partnership means a business entity that is not a 
corporation under paragraph (b) of this section and that has at least 
two members.
    (2) Wholly owned entities--(i) In general. A business entity that 
has a single owner and is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this 
section is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.
    (ii) Special rule for certain business entities. If the single owner 
of a business entity is a bank (as defined in section 581), then the 
special rules applicable to banks will continue to apply to the single 
owner as if the wholly owned entity were a separate entity.
    (d) Special rule for certain foreign business entities--(1) In 
general. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a 
foreign business entity described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section 
will not be treated as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this 
section if--
    (i) The entity was in existence on May 8, 1996;
    (ii) The entity's classification was relevant (as defined in 
Sec. 301.7701-3(d)) on May 8, 1996;
    (iii) No person (including the entity) for whom the entity's 
classification was relevant on May 8, 1996, treats the entity as a 
corporation for purposes of filing such person's federal income tax 
returns, information returns, and withholding documents for the taxable 
year including May 8, 1996;
    (iv) Any change in the entity's claimed classification within the 
sixty months prior to May 8, 1996, occurred solely as a result of a 
change in the organizational documents of the entity, and the entity and 
all members of the entity recognized the federal tax consequences of any 
change in the entity's classification within the sixty months prior to 
May 8, 1996;
    (v) A reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) existed 
on May 8, 1996, for treating the entity as other than a corporation; and
    (vi) Neither the entity nor any member was notified in writing on or 
before May 8, 1996, that the classification of the entity was under 
examination (in which case the entity's classification will be 
determined in the examination).
    (2) Binding contract rule. If a foreign business entity described in 
paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section is formed after May 8, 1996, 
pursuant to a written binding contract (including an accepted bid to 
develop a project) in effect on May 8, 1996, and all times thereafter, 
in which the parties agreed to engage (directly or indirectly) in an 
active and substantial business operation in the jurisdiction in which 
the entity is formed, paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be applied 
to that entity by substituting the date of the entity's formation for 
May 8, 1996.
    (3) Termination of grandfather status--(i) In general. An entity 
that is not treated as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this 
section by reason of paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section will be 
treated permanently as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this 
section from the earliest of:
    (A) The effective date of an election to be treated as an 
association under Sec. 301.7701-3;
    (B) A termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) 
(regarding sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the total interest 
in an entity's capital or profits within a twelve month period); or
    (C) A division of the partnership under section 708(b)(2)(B).
    (ii) Special rule for certain entities. For purposes of paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section shall not 
apply if the sale or exchange of interests in the entity is to a related 
person (within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)) and occurs no 
later than twelve months after the date of the formation of the entity.
    (e) Effective date. The rules of this section are effective as of 
January 1, 1997.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701-3  Classification of certain business entities.

    (a) In general. A business entity that is not classified as a 
corporation under Sec. 301.7701-2(b) (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or 
(8) (an eligible entity) can elect its classification for federal tax 
purposes as

[[Page 506]]

provided in this section. An eligible entity with at least two members 
can elect to be classified as either an association (and thus a 
corporation under Sec. 301.7701-2(b)(2)) or a partnership, and an 
eligible entity with a single owner can elect to be classified as an 
association or to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. 
Paragraph (b) of this section provides a default classification for an 
eligible entity that does not make an election. Thus, elections are 
necessary only when an eligible entity chooses to be classified 
initially as other than the default classification or when an eligible 
entity chooses to change its classification. An entity whose 
classification is determined under the default classification retains 
that classification (regardless of any changes in the members' liability 
that occurs at any time during the time that the entity's classification 
is relevant as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) until the 
entity makes an election to change that classification under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for 
making express elections. Paragraph (d) of this section provides special 
rules for foreign eligible entities. Paragraph (e) of this section 
provides special rules for classifying entities resulting from 
partnership terminations and divisions under section 708(b). Paragraph 
(f) of this section sets forth the effective date of this section and a 
special rule relating to prior periods.
    (b) Classification of eligible entities that do not file an 
election--(1) Domestic eligible entities. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the entity elects otherwise, a 
domestic eligible entity is--
    (i) A partnership if it has two or more members; or
    (ii) Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a 
single owner.
    (2) Foreign eligible entities--(i) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the entity elects otherwise, a 
foreign eligible entity is--
    (A) A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one 
member does not have limited liability;
    (B) An association if all members have limited liability; or
    (C) Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a 
single owner that does not have limited liability.
    (ii) Definition of limited liability. For purposes of paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section, a member of a foreign eligible entity has 
limited liability if the member has no personal liability for the debts 
of or claims against the entity by reason of being a member. This 
determination is based solely on the statute or law pursuant to which 
the entity is organized, except that if the underlying statute or law 
allows the entity to specify in its organizational documents whether the 
members will have limited liability, the organizational documents may 
also be relevant. For purposes of this section, a member has personal 
liability if the creditors of the entity may seek satisfaction of all or 
any portion of the debts or claims against the entity from the member as 
such. A member has personal liability for purposes of this paragraph 
even if the member makes an agreement under which another person 
(whether or not a member of the entity) assumes such liability or agrees 
to indemnify that member for any such liability.
    (3) Existing eligible entities--(i) In general. Unless the entity 
elects otherwise, an eligible entity in existence prior to the effective 
date of this section will have the same classification that the entity 
claimed under Secs. 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3 as in effect on the 
date prior to the effective date of this section; except that if an 
eligible entity with a single owner claimed to be a partnership under 
those regulations, the entity will be disregarded as an entity separate 
from its owner under this paragraph (b)(3)(i). For special rules 
regarding the classification of such entities for periods prior to the 
effective date of this section, see paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Special rules. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
section, a foreign eligible entity is treated as being in existence 
prior to the effective date of this section only if the entity's 
classification was relevant (as defined in paragraph (d) of this 
section) at any time during the sixty months prior to the effective date 
of this section. If an entity claimed different classifications

[[Page 507]]

prior to the effective date of this section, the entity's classification 
for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is the last 
classification claimed by the entity. If a foreign eligible entity's 
classification is relevant prior to the effective date of this section, 
but no federal tax or information return is filed or the federal tax or 
information return does not indicate the classification of the entity, 
the entity's classification for the period prior to the effective date 
of this section is determined under the regulations in effect on the 
date prior to the effective date of this section.
    (c) Elections--(1) Time and place for filing--(i) In general. Except 
as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section, an 
eligible entity may elect to be classified other than as provided under 
paragraph (b) of this section, or to change its classification, by 
filing Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, with the service 
center designated on Form 8832. An election will not be accepted unless 
all of the information required by the form and instructions, including 
the taxpayer identifying number of the entity, is provided on Form 8832. 
See Sec. 301.6109-1 for rules on applying for and displaying Employer 
Identification Numbers.
    (ii) Further notification of elections. An eligible entity required 
to file a federal tax or information return for the taxable year for 
which an election is made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must 
attach a copy of its Form 8832 to its federal tax or information return 
for that year. If the entity is not required to file a return for that 
year, a copy of its Form 8832 must be attached to the federal income tax 
or information return of any direct or indirect owner of the entity for 
the taxable year of the owner that includes the date on which the 
election was effective. An indirect owner of the entity does not have to 
attach a copy of the Form 8832 to its return if an entity in which it 
has an interest is already filing a copy of the Form 8832 with its 
return. If an entity, or one of its direct or indirect owners, fails to 
attach a copy of a Form 8832 to its return as directed in this section, 
an otherwise valid election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section 
will not be invalidated, but the non-filing party may be subject to 
penalties, including any applicable penalties if the federal tax or 
information returns are inconsistent with the entity's election under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Effective date of election. An election made under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section will be effective on the date specified by the 
entity on Form 8832 or on the date filed if no such date is specified on 
the election form. The effective date specified on Form 8832 can not be 
more than 75 days prior to the date on which the election is filed and 
can not be more than 12 months after the date on which the election is 
filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 75 days 
prior to the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective 
75 days prior to the date it was filed. If an election specifies an 
effective date more than 12 months from the date on which the election 
is filed, it will be effective 12 months after the date it was filed. If 
an election specifies an effective date before January 1, 1997, it will 
be effective as of January 1, 1997.
    (iv) Limitation. If an eligible entity makes an election under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to change its classification (other 
than an election made by an existing entity to change its classification 
as of the effective date of this section), the entity cannot change its 
classification by election again during the sixty months succeeding the 
effective date of the election. However, the Commissioner may permit the 
entity to change its classification by election within the sixty months 
if more than fifty percent of the ownership interests in the entity as 
of the effective date of the subsequent election are owned by persons 
that did not own any interests in the entity on the filing date or on 
the effective date of the entity's prior election.
    (v) Deemed elections--(A) Exempt organizations. An eligible entity 
that has been determined to be, or claims to be, exempt from taxation 
under section 501(a) is treated as having made an election under this 
section to be classified as an association. Such election will be 
effective as of the first day for which exemption is claimed or 
determined to apply, regardless of when the

[[Page 508]]

claim or determination is made, and will remain in effect unless an 
election is made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section after the 
date the claim for exempt status is withdrawn or rejected or the date 
the determination of exempt status is revoked.
    (B) Real estate investment trusts. An eligible entity that files an 
election under section 856(c)(1) to be treated as a real estate 
investment trust is treated as having made an election under this 
section to be classified as an association. Such election will be 
effective as of the first day the entity is treated as a real estate 
investment trust.
    (vi) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this 
paragraph (c)(1):

    Example 1. On July 1, 1998, X, a domestic corporation, purchases a 
10% interest in Y, an eligible entity formed under Country A law in 
1990. The entity's classification was not relevant to any person for 
federal tax or information purposes prior to X's acquisition of an 
interest in Y. Thus, Y is not considered to be in existence on the 
effective date of this section for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section. Under the applicable Country A statute, all members of Y have 
limited liability as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Accordingly, Y is classified as an association under paragraph 
(b)(2)(i)(B) of this section unless it elects under this paragraph (c) 
to be classified as a partnership. To be classified as a partnership as 
of July 1, 1998, Y must file a Form 8832 by September 14, 1998. See 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because an election cannot be 
effective more than 75 days prior to the date on which it is filed, if Y 
files its Form 8832 after September 14, 1998, it will be classified as 
an association from July 1, 1998, until the effective date of the 
election. In that case, it could not change its classification by 
election under this paragraph (c) during the sixty months succeeding the 
effective date of the election.
    Example 2. (i) Z is an eligible entity formed under Country B law 
and is in existence on the effective date of this section within the 
meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Prior to the effective date 
of this section, Z claimed to be classified as an association. Unless Z 
files an election under this paragraph (c), it will continue to be 
classified as an association under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Z files a Form 8832 pursuant to this paragraph (c) to be 
classified as a partnership, effective as of the effective date of this 
section. Z can file an election to be classified as an association at 
any time thereafter, but then would not be permitted to change its 
classification by election during the sixty months succeeding the 
effective date of that subsequent election.

    (2) Authorized signatures--(i) In general. An election made under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must be signed by--
    (A) Each member of the electing entity who is an owner at the time 
the election is filed; or
    (B) Any officer, manager, or member of the electing entity who is 
authorized (under local law or the entity's organizational documents) to 
make the election and who represents to having such authorization under 
penalties of perjury.
    (ii) Retroactive elections. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section, if an election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section 
is to be effective for any period prior to the time that it is filed, 
each person who was an owner between the date the election is to be 
effective and the date the election is filed, and who is not an owner at 
the time the election is filed, must also sign the election.
    (d) Special rules for foreign eligible entities--(1) For purposes of 
this section, a foreign eligible entity's classification is relevant 
when its classification affects the liability of any person for federal 
tax or information purposes. For example, a foreign entity's 
classification would be relevant if U.S. income was paid to the entity 
and the determination by the withholding agent of the amount to be 
withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (if any) would 
vary depending upon whether the entity is classified as a partnership or 
as an association. Thus, the classification might affect the 
documentation that the withholding agent must receive from the entity, 
the type of tax or information return to file, or how the return must be 
prepared. The date that the classification of a foreign eligible entity 
is relevant is the date an event occurs that creates an obligation to 
file a federal tax return, information return, or statement for which 
the classification of the entity must be determined. Thus, the 
classification of a foreign entity is relevant, for example, on the date 
that an interest in the entity is acquired which will require a

[[Page 509]]

U.S. person to file an information return on Form 5471.
    (2) Special rule when classification is no longer relevant. If the 
classification of a foreign eligible entity which was previously 
relevant for federal tax purposes ceases to be relevant for sixty 
consecutive months, the entity's classification will initially be 
determined under the default classification when the classification of 
the foreign eligible entity again becomes relevant. The date that the 
classification of a foreign entity ceases to be relevant is the date an 
event occurs that causes the classification to no longer be relevant, 
or, if no event occurs in a taxable year that causes the classification 
to be relevant, then the date is the first day of that taxable year.
    (e) Coordination with section 708(b). Except as provided in 
Sec. 301.7701-2(d)(3) (regarding termination of grandfather status for 
certain foreign business entities), an entity resulting from a 
transaction described in section 708(b)(1)(B) (partnership termination 
due to sales or exchanges) or section 708(b)(2)(B) (partnership 
division) is a partnership.
    (f) Effective date--(1) In general. The rules of this section are 
effective as of January 1, 1997.
    (2) Prior treatment of existing entities. In the case of a business 
entity that is not described in Sec. 301.7701-2(b) (1), (3), (4), (5), 
(6), or (7), and that was in existence prior to January 1, 1997, the 
entity's claimed classification(s) will be respected for all periods 
prior to January 1, 1997, if--
    (i) The entity had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 
6662) for its claimed classification;
    (ii) The entity and all members of the entity recognized the federal 
tax consequences of any change in the entity's classification within the 
sixty months prior to January 1, 1997; and
    (iii) Neither the entity nor any member was notified in writing on 
or before May 8, 1996, that the classification of the entity was under 
examination (in which case the entity's classification will be 
determined in the examination).

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701-4   Trusts.

    (a) Ordinary trusts. In general, the term ``trust'' as used in the 
Internal Revenue Code refers to an arrangement created either by a will 
or by an inter vivos declaration whereby trustees take title to property 
for the purpose of protecting or conserving it for the beneficiaries 
under the ordinary rules applied in chancery or probate courts. Usually 
the beneficiaries of such a trust do no more than accept the benefits 
thereof and are not the voluntary planners or creators of the trust 
arrangement. However, the beneficiaries of such a trust may be the 
persons who create it and it will be recognized as a trust under the 
Internal Revenue Code if it was created for the purpose of protecting or 
conserving the trust property for beneficiaries who stand in the same 
relation to the trust as they would if the trust had been created by 
others for them. Generally speaking, an arrangement will be treated as a 
trust under the Internal Revenue Code if it can be shown that the 
purpose of the arrangement is to vest in trustees responsibility for the 
protection and conservation of property for beneficiaries who cannot 
share in the discharge of this responsibility and, therefore, are not 
associates in a joint enterprise for the conduct of business for profit.
    (b) Business trusts. There are other arrangements which are known as 
trusts because the legal title to property is conveyed to trustees for 
the benefit of beneficiaries, but which are not classified as trusts for 
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code because they are not simply 
arrangements to protect or conserve the property for the beneficiaries. 
These trusts, which are often known as business or commercial trusts, 
generally are created by the beneficiaries simply as a device to carry 
on a profit-making business which normally would have been carried on 
through business organizations that are classified as corporations or 
partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code. However, the fact that the 
corpus of the trust is not supplied by the beneficiaries is not 
sufficient reason in itself for classifying the arrangement as an 
ordinary trust rather than as an association or partnership. The fact 
that any organization is

[[Page 510]]

technically cast in the trust form, by conveying title to property to 
trustees for the benefit of persons designated as beneficiaries, will 
not change the real character of the organization if the organization is 
more properly classified as a business entity under Sec. 301.7701-2.
    (c) Certain investment trusts--(1) An ``investment'' trust will not 
be classified as a trust if there is a power under the trust agreement 
to vary the investment of the certificate holders. See Commissioner v. 
North American Bond Trust, 122 F. 2d 545 (2d Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 
314 U.S. 701 (1942). An investment trust with a single class of 
ownership interests, representing undivided beneficial interests in the 
assets of the trust, will be classified as a trust if there is no power 
under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the certificate 
holders. An investment trust with multiple classes of ownership 
interests ordinarily will be classified as a business entity under 
Sec. 301.7701-2; however, an investment trust with multiple classes of 
ownership interests, in which there is no power under the trust 
agreement to vary the investment of the certificate holders, will be 
classified as a trust if the trust is formed to facilitate direct 
investment in the assets of the trust and the existence of multiple 
classes of ownership interests is incidental to that purpose.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be 
illustated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A corporation purchases a portfolio of residential 
mortgages and transfers the mortgages to a bank under a trust agreement. 
At the same time, the bank as trustee delivers to the corporation 
certificates evidencing rights to payments from the pooled mortgages; 
the corporation sells the certificates to the public. The trustee holds 
legal title to the mortgages in the pool for the benefit of the 
certificate holders but has no power to reinvest proceeds attributable 
to the mortgages in the pool or to vary investments in the pool in any 
other manner. There are two classes of certificates. Holders of class A 
certificates are entitled to all payments of mortgage principal, both 
scheduled and prepaid, until their certificates are retired; holders of 
class B certificates receive payments of principal only after all class 
A certificates have been retired. The different rights of the class A 
and class B certificates serve to shift to the holders of the class A 
certificates, in addition to the earlier scheduled payments of 
principal, the risk that mortgages in the pool will be prepaid so that 
the holders of the class B certificates will have ``call protection'' 
(freedom from premature termination of their interests on account of 
prepayments). The trust thus serves to create investment interests with 
respect to the mortgages held by the trust that differ significantly 
from direct investment in the mortgages. As a consequence, the existence 
of multiple classes of trust ownership is not incidental to any purpose 
of the trust to facilitate direct investment, and, accordingly, the 
trust is classified as a business entity under Sec. 301.7701-2.
    Example 2. Corporation M is the originator of a portfolio of 
residential mortgages and transfers the mortgages to a bank under a 
trust agreement. At the same time, the bank as trustee delivers to M 
certificates evidencing rights to payments from the pooled mortgages. 
The trustee holds legal title to the mortgages in the pool for the 
benefit of the certificate holders, but has no power to reinvest 
proceeds attributable to the mortgages in the pool or to vary 
investments in the pool in any other manner. There are two classes of 
certificates. Holders of class C certificates are entitled to receive 90 
percent of the payments of principal and interest on the mortgages; 
class D certificate holders are entitled to receive the other ten 
percent. The two classes of certificates are identical except that, in 
the event of a default on the underlying mortgages, the payment rights 
of class D certificate holders are subordinated to the rights of class C 
certificate holders. M sells the class C certificates to investors and 
retains the class D certificates. The trust has multiple classes of 
ownership interests, given the greater security provided to holders of 
class C certificates. The interests of certificate holders, however, are 
substantially equivalent to undivided interests in the pool of 
mortgages, coupled with a limited recourse guarantee running from M to 
the holders of class C certificates. In such circumstances, the 
existence of multiple classes of ownership interests is incidental to 
the trust's purpose of facilitating direct investment in the assets of 
the trust. Accordingly, the trust is classified as a trust.
    Example 3. A promoter forms a trust in which shareholders of a 
publicly traded corporation can deposit their stock. For each share of 
stock deposited with the trust, the participant receives two 
certificates that are initially attached, but may be separated and 
traded independently of each other. One certificate represents the right 
to dividends and the value of the underlying stock up to a specified 
amount; the other certificate represents the right to appreciation in 
the stock's value above the specified amount. The separate certificates 
represent two different classes of ownership interest in the

[[Page 511]]

trust, which effectively separate dividend rights on the stock held by 
the trust from a portion of the right to appreciation in the value of 
such stock. The multiple classes of ownership interests are designed to 
permit investors, by transferring one of the certificates and retaining 
the other, to fulfill their varying investment objectives of seeking 
primarily either dividend income or capital appreciation from the stock 
held by the trust. Given that the trust serves to create investment 
interests with respect to the stock held by the trust that differ 
significantly from direct investment in such stock, the trust is not 
formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of the trust. 
Accordingly, the trust is classified as a business entity under 
Sec. 301.7701-2.
    Example 4. Corporation N purchases a portfolio of bonds and 
transfers the bonds to a bank under a trust agreement. At the same time, 
the trustee delivers to N certificates evidencing interests in the 
bonds. These certificates are sold to public investors. Each certificate 
represents the right to receive a particular payment with respect to a 
specific bond. Under section 1286, stripped coupons and stripped bonds 
are treated as separate bonds for federal income tax purposes. Although 
the interest of each certificate holder is different from that of each 
other certificate holder, and the trust thus has multiple classes of 
ownership, the multiple classes simply provide each certificate holder 
with a direct interest in what is treated under section 1286 as a 
separate bond. Given the similarity of the interests acquired by the 
certificate holders to the interests that could be acquired by direct 
investment, the multiple classes of trust interests merely facilitate 
direct investment in the assets held by the trust. Accordingly, the 
trust is classified as a trust.

    (d) Liquidating trusts. Certain organizations which are commonly 
known as liquidating trusts are treated as trusts for purposes of the 
Internal Revenue Code. An organization will be considered a liquidating 
trust if it is organized for the primary purpose of liquidating and 
distributing the assets transferred to it, and if its activities are all 
reasonably necessary to, and consistent with, the accomplishment of that 
purpose. A liquidating trust is treated as a trust for purposes of the 
Internal Revenue Code because it is formed with the objective of 
liquidating particular assets and not as an organization having as its 
purpose the carrying on of a profit-making business which normally would 
be conducted through business organizations classified as corporations 
or partnerships. However, if the liquidation is unreasonably prolonged 
or if the liquidation purpose becomes so obscured by business activities 
that the declared purpose of liquidation can be said to be lost or 
abandoned, the status of the organization will no longer be that of a 
liquidating trust. Bondholders' protective committees, voting trusts, 
and other agencies formed to protect the interests of security holders 
during insolvency, bankruptcy, or corporate reorganization proceedings 
are analogous to liquidating trusts but if subsequently utilized to 
further the control or profitable operation of a going business on a 
permanent continuing basis, they will lose their classification as 
trusts for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (e) Environmental remediation trusts. (1) An environmental 
remediation trust is considered a trust for purposes of the Internal 
Revenue Code. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an organization is an 
environmental remediation trust if the organization is organized under 
state law as a trust; the primary purpose of the trust is collecting and 
disbursing amounts for environmental remediation of an existing waste 
site to resolve, satisfy, mitigate, address, or prevent the liability or 
potential liability of persons imposed by federal, state, or local 
environmental laws; all contributors to the trust have (at the time of 
contribution and thereafter) actual or potential liability or a 
reasonable expectation of liability under federal, state, or local 
environmental laws for environmental remediation of the waste site; and 
the trust is not a qualified settlement fund within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.468B-1(a) of this chapter. An environmental remediation trust is 
classified as a trust because its primary purpose is environmental 
remediation of an existing waste site and not the carrying on of a 
profit-making business that normally would be conducted through business 
organizations classified as corporations or partnerships. However, if 
the remedial purpose is altered or becomes so obscured by business or 
investment activities that the declared remedial purpose is no longer 
controlling, the organization will no longer be classified as a trust.

[[Page 512]]

For purposes of this paragraph (e), environmental remediation includes 
the costs of assessing environmental conditions, remedying and removing 
environmental contamination, monitoring remedial activities and the 
release of substances, preventing future releases of substances, and 
collecting amounts from persons liable or potentially liable for the 
costs of these activities. For purposes of this paragraph (e), persons 
have potential liability or a reasonable expectation of liability under 
federal, state, or local environmental laws for remediation of the 
existing waste site if there is authority under a federal, state, or 
local law that requires or could reasonably be expected to require such 
persons to satisfy all or a portion of the costs of the environmental 
remediation.
    (2) Each contributor (grantor) to the trust is treated as the owner 
of the portion of the trust contributed by that grantor under rules 
provided in section 677 and Sec. 1.677(a)-1(d) of this chapter. Section 
677 and Sec. 1.677(a)-1(d) of this chapter provide rules regarding the 
treatment of a grantor as the owner of a portion of a trust applied in 
discharge of the grantor's legal obligation. Items of income, deduction, 
and credit attributable to an environmental remediation trust are not 
reported by the trust on Form 1041, but are shown on a separate 
statement to be attached to that form. See Sec. 1.671-4(a) of this 
chapter. The trustee must also furnish to each grantor a statement that 
shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust for the 
grantor's taxable year attributable to the portion of the trust treated 
as owned by the grantor. The statement must provide the grantor with the 
information necessary to take the items into account in computing the 
grantor's taxable income, including information necessary to determine 
the federal tax treatment of the items (for example, whether an item is 
a deductible expense under section 162(a) or a capital expenditure under 
section 263(a)) and how the item should be taken into account under the 
economic performance rules of section 461(h) and the regulations 
thereunder. See Sec. 1.461-4 of this chapter for rules relating to 
economic performance.
    (3) All amounts contributed to an environmental remediation trust by 
a grantor (cash-out grantor) who, pursuant to an agreement with the 
other grantors, contributes a fixed amount to the trust and is relieved 
by the other grantors of any further obligation to make contributions to 
the trust, but remains liable or potentially liable under the applicable 
environmental laws, will be considered amounts contributed for 
remediation. An environmental remediation trust agreement may direct the 
trustee to expend amounts contributed by a cash-out grantor (and the 
earnings thereon) before expending amounts contributed by other grantors 
(and the earnings thereon). A cash-out grantor will cease to be treated 
as an owner of a portion of the trust when the grantor's portion is 
fully expended by the trust.
    (4) The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. (a) X, Y, and Z are calendar year corporations that are 
liable for the remediation of an existing waste site under applicable 
federal environmental laws. On June 1, 1996, pursuant to an agreement 
with the governing federal agency, X, Y, and Z create an environmental 
remediation trust within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
to collect funds contributed to the trust by X, Y, and Z and to carry 
out the remediation of the waste site to the satisfaction of the federal 
agency. X, Y, and Z are jointly and severally liable under the federal 
environmental laws for the remediation of the waste site, and the 
federal agency will not release X, Y, or Z from liability until the 
waste site is remediated to the satisfaction of the agency.
    (b) The estimated cost of the remediation is $20,000,000. X, Y, and 
Z agree that, if Z contributes $1,000,000 to the trust, Z will not be 
required to make any additional contributions to the trust, and X and Y 
will complete the remediation of the waste site and make additional 
contributions if necessary.
    (c) On June 1, 1996, X, Y, and Z each contribute $1,000,000 to the 
trust. The trust agreement directs the trustee to spend Z's 
contributions to the trust and the income allocable to Z's portion 
before spending X's and Y's portions. On November 30, 1996, the trustee 
disburses $2,000,000 for remediation work performed from June 1, 1996, 
through September 30, 1996. For the six-month period ending November 30, 
1996, the interest earned on the funds in the trust was $75,000, which 
is allocated in equal shares of $25,000 to X's, Y's, and Z's portions of 
the trust.

[[Page 513]]

    (d) Z made no further contributions to the trust. Pursuant to the 
trust agreement, the trustee expended Z's portion of the trust before 
expending X's and Y's portion. Therefore, Z's share of the remediation 
disbursement made in 1996 is $1,025,000 ($1,000,000 contribution by Z 
plus $25,000 of interest allocated to Z's portion of the trust). Z takes 
the $1,025,000 disbursement into account under the appropriate federal 
tax accounting rules. In addition, X's share of the remediation 
disbursement made in 1996 is $487,500, and Y's share of the remediation 
disbursement made in 1996 is $487,500. X and Y take their respective 
shares of the disbursement into account under the appropriate federal 
tax accounting rules.
    (e) The trustee made no further remediation disbursements in 1996, 
and X and Y made no further contributions in 1996. From December 1, 
1996, to December 31, 1996, the interest earned on the funds remaining 
in the trust was $5,000, which is allocated $2,500 to X's portion and 
$2,500 to Y's portion. Accordingly, for 1996, X and Y each had interest 
income of $27,500 from the trust and Z had interest income of $25,000 
from the trust.

    (5) This paragraph (e) is applicable to trusts meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section that are formed on or 
after May 1, 1996. This paragraph (e) may be relied on by trusts formed 
before May 1, 1996, if the trust has at all times met all requirements 
of this paragraph (e) and the grantors have reported items of ,income 
and deduction consistent with this paragraph (e) on original or amended 
returns. For trusts formed before May 1, 1996, that are not described in 
the preceding sentence, the Commissioner may permit by letter ruling, in 
appropriate circumstances, this paragraph (e) to be applied subject to 
appropriate terms and conditions.
    (f) Effective date. The rules of this section generally apply to 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1960. Paragraph (e)(5) of 
this section contains rules of applicability for paragraph (e) of this 
section. In addition, the last sentences of paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and 
(c)(2) Example 1 and Example 3 of this section are effective as of 
January 1, 1997.

Sec. 301.7701-5   Domestic, foreign, resident, and nonresident persons.

    A domestic corporation is one organized or created in the United 
States, including only the States (and during the periods when not 
States, the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii), and the District of 
Columbia, or under the law of the United States or of any State or 
Territory. A foreign corporation is one which is not domestic. A 
domestic corporation is a resident corporation even though it does no 
business and owns no property in the United States. A foreign 
corporation engaged in trade or business within the United States is 
referred to in the regulations in this chapter as a resident foreign 
corporation, and a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business 
within the United States, as a nonresident foreign corporation. A 
partnership engaged in trade or business within the United States is 
referred to in the regulations in this chapter as a resident 
partnership, and a partnership not engaged in trade or business within 
the United States, as a nonresident partnership. Whether a partnership 
is to be regarded as resident or nonresident is not determined by the 
nationality or residence of its members or by the place in which it was 
created or organized. The term ``nonresident alien,'' as used in the 
regulations in this chapter, includes a nonresident alien individual and 
a nonresident alien fiduciary.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7701-6  Definitions; person, fiduciary.

    (a) Person. The term person includes an individual, a corporation, a 
partnership, a trust or estate, a joint-stock company, an association, 
or a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated 
organization or group. The term also includes a guardian, committee, 
trustee, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, 
assignee for the benefit of creditors, conservator, or any person acting 
in a fiduciary capacity.
    (b) Fiduciary--(1) In general. Fiduciary is a term that applies to 
persons who occupy positions of peculiar confidence toward others, such 
as trustees, executors, and administrators. A fiduciary is a person who 
holds in trust an

[[Page 514]]

estate to which another has a beneficial interest, or receives and 
controls income of another, as in the case of receivers. A committee or 
guardian of the property of an incompetent person is a fiduciary.
    (2) Fiduciary distinguished from agent. There may be a fiduciary 
relationship between an agent and a principal, but the word agent does 
not denote a fiduciary. An agent having entire charge of property, with 
authority to effect and execute leases with tenants entirely on his own 
responsibility and without consulting his principal, merely turning over 
the net profits from the property periodically to his principal by 
virtue of authority conferred upon him by a power of attorney, is not a 
fiduciary within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. In cases when 
no legal trust has been created in the estate controlled by the agent 
and attorney, the liability to make a return rests with the principal.
    (c) Effective date. The rules of this section are effective as of 
January 1, 1997.

Sec. 301.7701-8   Military or naval forces and Armed Forces of the United States.

    The term ``military or naval forces of the United States'' and the 
term ``Armed Forces of the United States'' each includes all regular and 
reserve components of the uniformed services which are subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the 
Secretary of the Navy, or the Secretary of the Air Force. The terms also 
include the Coast Guard. The members of such forces include commissioned 
officers and the personnel below the grade of commissioned officer in 
such forces.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7701-9   Secretary or his delegate.

    (a) The term Secretary or his delegate means the Secretary of the 
Treasury, or any officer, employee, or agency of the Treasury Department 
duly authorized by the Secretary (directly, or indirectly by one or more 
redelegations of authority) to perform the function mentioned or 
described in the context, and the term ``or his delegate'' when used in 
connection with any other official of the United States shall be 
similarly construed.
    (b) In any case in which a function is vested by the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954 or any other statute in the Secretary or his 
delegate, and Treasury regulations or Treasury decisions approved by the 
Secretary or his delegate provide that such function may be performed by 
the Commissioner, assistant commissioner, regional commissioner, 
assistant regional commissioner, district director, director of a 
regional service center, or by a designated officer or employee in the 
office of any such officer, such provision in the regulations or 
Treasury decision shall constitute a delegation by the Secretary of the 
authority to perform such function to the designated officer or 
employee. If such authority is delegated to any officer or employee 
performing services under the supervision and control of the 
Commissioner, such provision in the regulations or Treasury decision 
shall constitute a delegation by the Secretary to the Commissioner of 
the authority to perform such function and a redelegation thereof by the 
Commissioner to the designated officer or employee.
    (c) An officer or employee, including the Commissioner, authorized 
by regulations or Treasury decision to perform a function shall have 
authority to redelegate the performance of such function to any officer 
or employee performing services under his supervision and control, 
unless such power to so redelegate is prohibited or restricted by proper 
order or directive. The Commissioner may also redelegate authority to 
perform such function to other officers or employees under his 
supervision and control and, to the extent he deems proper, may 
authorize further redelegation of such authority.
    (d) The Commissioner may prescribe such limitations as he deems 
proper on the extent to which any officer or employee under his 
supervision and control shall perform any such function, but, in the 
case of an officer or employee designated in regulations or Treasury 
decision as authorized to perform such function, such limitations shall 
not render invalid any performance by such officer or employee of the

[[Page 515]]

function which, except for such limitations, such officer or employee is 
authorized to perform by such regulations or Treasury decision in effect 
at the time the function is performed.

Sec. 301.7701-11   Social security number.

    For purposes of this chapter, the term social security number means 
the taxpayer identifying number of an individual or estate which is 
assigned pursuant to section 6011(b) or corresponding provisions of 
prior law, or pursuant to section 6109, and in which nine digits are 
separated by hyphens as follows: 000-00-0000. Such term does not include 
a number with a letter as a suffix which is used to identify an 
auxiliary beneficiary under the social security program. The terms 
``account number'' and ``social security number'' refer to the same 
number.

section 6011 (b) or corresponding provisions of prior law, or pursuant 
to section 6109, and in which nine digits are separated by a hyphen, as 
follows: 00-0000000. The terms ``employer identification number'' and 
``identification number'' (defined in Sec. 31.0-2(a)(11) of this chapter 
(Employment Tax Regulations)) refer to the same number.

Sec. 301.7701-13  Pre-1970 domestic building and loan association.

    (a) In general. For taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, 
and before July 12, 1969, the term ``domestic building and loan 
association'' means a domestic building and loan association, a domestic 
savings and loan association, a Federal savings and loan association, 
and any other savings institution chartered and supervised as a savings 
and loan or similar association under Federal or State law which meets 
supervisory test (described in paragraph (b) of this section), the 
business operations test (described in paragraph (c) of this section), 
and each of the various assets tests (described in paragraphs (d), (e), 
(f), and (h) of this section). For the definition of the term ``domestic 
building and loan association'', for taxable years beginning after July 
11, 1969, see Sec. 301.7701-13A.
    (b) Supervisory test. A domestic building and loan association must 
be either (1) an insured institution within the meaning of section 
401(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724 (a)) or (2) subject 
by law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority 
having supervision over such associations. An ``insured institution'' is 
one the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corporation.
    (c) Business operations test--(1) In general. An association must 
utilize its assets so that substantially all of its business consists of 
acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the loans described 
in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section. The 
requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the 
business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the 
public and investing in the prescribed loans includes ancillary or 
incidental activities which are directly and primarily related to such 
acquisition and investment, such as advertising for savings, appraising 
property on which loans are to be made by the association, and 
inspecting the progress of construction in connection with construction 
loans. Even though an association meets the supervisory test in 
paragraph (b) and all the assets tests described in paragraphs (d) 
through (h) of this section, it will nevertheless not qualify as a 
domestic building and loan association if any substantial part of its 
business consists of activities which are not directly and primarily 
related to such acquisition and investment,

[[Page 516]]

such as brokering mortgage paper, selling insurance, or subdividing real 
estate. However, an association will meet the business operations test 
for a taxable year if it meets the requirements of both subparagraphs 
(2) and (3) of this paragraph (c), relating respectively to acquiring 
the savings of the public, and investing in loans.
    (2) Acquiring the savings of the public. The requirement that 
substantially all of an association's business (other than investing in 
loans) must consist of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily 
will be considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material 
respects in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or 
supervisory authority. In addition, such requirement will be considered 
to be met if more than 85 percent of the dollar amount of the total 
deposits and withdrawable shares of the association are held during the 
taxable year by the general public as opposed to amounts deposited by 
family or related business groups or persons who are officers or 
directors of the association. The percentage specified in this 
subparagraph shall be computed as of the close of the taxable year, or 
at the option of the taxpayer, on the basis of the average of the 
amounts of deposits held during the year. Such average shall be 
determined by computing the percentage specified either as of the close 
of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during 
the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, 
quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained.
    (3) Investing in loans--(i) In general. The requirement that 
substantially all of an association's business (other than acquiring the 
savings of the public) must consist of investing in the loans described 
in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section 
ordinarily will be considered to be met for a taxable year if the 
association meets both the gross income test described in subdivision 
(ii) of this subparagraph, and the sales activity test described in 
subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. However, if an association does 
not meet the requirements of both subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this 
subparagraph, it will nevertheless meet the investing in loans 
requirement if it is able to demonstrate that substantially all its 
business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) consisted of 
investing in the prescribed loans. Transactions which are necessitated 
by exceptional circumstances and which are not undertaken as recurring 
business activities for profit will not be considered a substantial part 
of an association's business. Thus, for example, an association would 
meet the investing in loans requirement if it can establish that it 
failed to meet the gross income test because of receipt of a non-
recurring item of income due to exceptional circumstances, or it failed 
to meet the sales activity test because of sales made to achieve 
necessary liquidity to meet abnormal withdrawals from savings accounts. 
For the purposes of this subparagraph, however, the acquisition of loans 
in anticipation of their sale to other financial institutions does not 
constitute ``investing'' in loans, even though such acquisition and sale 
resulted from an excess of demand for loans over savings capital in the 
association's area.
    (ii) Gross income test. The gross income test is met if more than 85 
percent of the gross income of an association consists of:
    (a) Interest or dividends on assets defined in subparagraph (2), 
(3), or (4) of paragraph (d) of this section,
    (b) Interest on loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of 
paragraph (d) of this section,
    (c) Income attributable to the portion of property used in the 
association's business as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section,
    (d) Premiums, discounts, commissions, or fees (including late 
charges and penalties) on loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through 
(10) of paragraph (d) of this section which have at some time been held 
by the association, or for which firm commitments have been issued,
    (e) Gain or loss on the sale of governmental obligations defined in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or
    (f) Income, gain, or loss attributable to foreclosed property (as 
defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section), but not including such 
income, gain, or loss

[[Page 517]]

which, pursuant to section 595 and the regulations thereunder, is not 
included in gross income.

For the purposes of this subparagraph, gross income shall be computed 
without regard to gains or losses on the sale of the portion of property 
used in the association's business (described in paragraph (d)(5) of 
this section), without regard to gains or losses on the rented portion 
of property used as the principal or branch office of the association 
(described in such paragraph), and without regard to gains or losses on 
the sale of participations and loans (other than governmental 
obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section). Examples of 
types of income which would cause an association to fail to meet the 
gross income test, if in the aggregate they exceed 15 percent of gross 
income, are the excess of gains over losses on sale of real estate 
(other than foreclosed property); rental income (other than on 
foreclosed property and the portion of property used in the 
association's business); premiums, commissions, and fees (other than 
commitment fees) on loans which have never been held by the association; 
and insurance brokerage fees.
    (iii) Sales activity test: in general. The sales activity test is 
met for a taxable year if the association meets both the sales of whole 
loans test described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, and the 
sales of whole loans and participations test described in subdivision 
(v) of this subparagraph. For the purposes of this subdivision and 
subdivisions (iv), (v), and (vi) of this subparagraph:
    (a) The term loan means loan as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section, other than foreclosed property defined in such paragraph and 
governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (b) The amount of a loan shall be determined in accordance with the 
rules contained in paragraph (l) (1) and (2)(ii) of this section.
    (c) The term loans acquired for investment during the taxable year 
means the amount of loans outstanding as of the close of the taxable 
year, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of loans outstanding as 
of the beginning of such year, and increased by the lesser of (1) the 
amount of repayments made on loans during the taxable year or (2) an 
amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of loans outstanding as of the 
beginning of the taxable year. For this purpose, repayments do not 
include repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by 
the association.
    (d) The term sales of participations means sales by an association 
of interests in loans, which sales meet the requirements of the 
regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board relating to sales of 
participations, or which meet substantially equivalent requirements of 
State law or regulations relating to sales of participations.
    (e) The term sales of whole loans means sales of loans other than 
sales of participations as defined in subdivision (d) of this 
subdivision, but in determining the amount of sales of whole loans, the 
following sales shall be disregarded: Sales of loans made to other 
financial institutions pursuant to an arrangement whereunder the 
association simultaneously enters in a bona fide agreement to repurchase 
such loans within a period of 18 months from the time of sale if such 
arrangement conforms to the rules and regulations of applicable 
supervisory authorities; sales made to the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corporation or to a corporation defined in paragraph (d)(4) of 
this section (relating to deposit insurance company securities); and 
sales made in the course of liquidation of the association pursuant to 
Federal or State law.
    (iv) Sales of whole loans test. The sales of whole loans test is met 
for a taxable year if the amount of sales of whole loans during the 
taxable year does not exceed the greater of (a) 15 percent of the amount 
of loans acquired for investment during the taxable year, or (b) 20 
percent of the amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of the 
taxable year. However, the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation 
specified in subdivision (b) of the previous sentence shall be reduced 
by the number of percentage points (rounded to the nearest one hundredth 
of a percentage point) which is equal to the sum of the 2 percentages 
obtained by dividing, for each of the 2 preceding taxable years,

[[Page 518]]

the amount of sales of whole loans during each such taxable year by the 
amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of such taxable year. For 
example, if the amounts of sales of whole loans made by a calendar year 
association in 1965 and 1966 were 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, 
of loans outstanding at the beginning of each such year, the amount of 
sales of whole loans allowed under such subdivision (b) for 1967 would 
be an amount equal to 13 percent (20 percent minus 7 percentage points) 
of loans outstanding at the beginning of 1967. In computing the 
reduction to the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in 
such subdivision (b), sales of whole loans made before January 1, 1964, 
shall not be taken into account.
    (v) Sales of whole loans and participations test. The sales of whole 
loans and participations test is met if the sum of the amount of sales 
of whole loans and the amount of sales of participations during the 
taxable year does not exceed 100 percent of the amount of loans acquired 
for investment during the taxable year.
    (vi) Sales activity tests: special rules--(a) Carryover of sales. 
The amount specified in subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph as the 
maximum amount of sales of whole loans shall be increased by the amount 
by which 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment by 
the association during the 2 preceding taxable years exceeds the amount 
of sales of whole loans made during such preceding taxable years; and 
the amount specified in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph as the 
maximum amount of sales of whole loans and participations shall be 
increased by the amount by which the amount of loans acquired for 
investment by the association during the 2 preceding taxable years 
exceeds the sum of the amount of sales of whole loans and participations 
made during such preceding taxable years. For example, if 15 percent of 
the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 and 1966 exceeded 
the amount of sales of whole loans during such years by $250,000, the 
amount of sales of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision 
(iv)(a) of this subparagraph would be increased by $250,000.
    (b) Use of preceding year's base. If the amount of loans acquired 
for investment by the association during the preceding taxable year 
exceeds such amount for the current taxable year, the 15 percent 
limitation provided in subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph and the 
100 percent limitation provided in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph 
shall be based upon such preceding taxable year's amount. However, the 
maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under subdivision 
(iv)(a) and the maximum amount of sales of whole loans and 
participations permitted under subdivision (v) in any taxable year shall 
be reduced by the amount of the increase in such sales allowed for the 
preceding taxable year solely by reason of the application of the 
provisions of the previous sentence. For example, assuming no carryover 
of sales under subdivision (a) of this subdivision, if the amount of 
loans acquired for investment by a calendar year association was 
$1,000,000 in 1965, under subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph the 
association could make sales of whole loans in 1966 of $150,000 (15 
percent of $1,000,000) even though the amount of its loans acquired for 
investment during 1966 was only $800,000. However, the amount of sales 
of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision (iv)(a) of this 
subparagraph would be reduced to the extent that the amount of the sales 
of whole loans made by the association during 1966 exceeded $120,000 (15 
percent of $800,000).
    (vii) Examples illustrating sales activity test. The provisions of 
subdivisions (iii) through (vi) of this subparagraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that the 
association is a calendar year taxpayer which is operated in all 
material respects in conformity with applicable rules and regulations of 
Federal or State supervisory authorities.

    Example 1. X Association made sales of whole loans in 1964 and 1965 
which were 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of the amounts of 
loans outstanding at the beginning of each such year, and which were 25 
percent and 17 percent, respectively, of the amounts of loans acquired 
for investment in each such year. The amount of X's loans outstanding at 
the beginning of 1966 was $1 million, and the amount of its loans 
acquired for investment for such year was $300,000. The

[[Page 519]]

maximum amount of sales of whole loans which X may make under the 
percentage of beginning loans limitation for 1966 is $30,000, which is 3 
percent (20 percent reduced by the sum of 10 percent and 7 percent) of 
$1 million. The maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under 
the percentage of loans acquired for investment limitation for 1966 is 
$45,000 (15 percent of $300,000). X may therefore sell whole loans in an 
amount up to $45,000 in 1966 and meet the sales of whole loans test. It 
is assumed that the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 did 
not exceed $300,000, so that the preceding year's base cannot be used to 
increase the amount of sales permitted in 1966.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in the previous example, except 
that the amount of loans acquired for investment in the preceding year 
(1965) was $320,000. Since such amount is greater than the $300,000 
amount of loans acquired for investment in 1966, X may base its 15 
percent limitation for 1966 on the $320,000 amount and sell whole loans 
in an amount up to $48,000 (15 percent of $320,000) and still meet the 
sales of whole loans test. However, to the extent that the amount of 
sales of whole loans exceeds $45,000 (15 percent of the $300,000 amount 
of loans acquired for investment in 1966), the maximum amount of sales 
computed under the percentage of loans acquired for investment 
limitation (but not the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation) for 
1967 must be reduced.
    Example 3. Y Association made no sales of whole loans in 1964 and 
1965, and made sales of participations in the 2 years in amounts which, 
in the aggregate, were $50,000 less than the amounts of loans acquired 
for investment for such years. At the beginning of 1966 the amount of 
Y's loans outstanding was $1 million, and the amount of its loans 
acquired for investment in such year was $100,000. Although the maximum 
amount of sales of whole loans which Y could make under the sales of 
whole loans test is $200,000 (20 percent of $1 million), nevertheless, 
in order to meet the sales of whole loans and participations test, the 
sum of the amounts of sales of whole loans and sales of participations 
may not exceed $150,000 (100 percent of the $100,000 amount of loans 
acquired for investment in 1966 plus a carryover of sales from the 
previous two years of $50,000). It is assumed that the amount of loans 
acquired for investment in 1965 did not exceed $100,000, so that the 
preceding year's base cannot be used to increase the amount of sales 
permitted in 1966.

    (viii) Reporting requirements. In the case of income tax returns for 
taxable years ending after October 31, 1964, there shall be filed with 
the return a statement showing the amount of gross income for the 
taxable year in each of the categories described in subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph; and, for the taxable year and the two preceding 
taxable years, the amount of loans (described in subdivision (iii) (a) 
of this subparagraph) outstanding at the beginning of the year and at 
the end of the year, the amount of repayments on loans (not including 
repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by the 
association), the amount of sales of whole loans, and the amount of 
sales of participations.
    (4) Effective date. The provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) 
of this paragraph (c), are applicable to taxable years ending after 
October 31, 1964. However, at the option of the taxpayer, for a taxable 
year beginning before November 1, 1964, and ending after October 31, 
1964, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph 
(except the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in 
subdivision (iv)(b) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c)) shall 
apply only to the part year falling after October 31, 1964, as if such 
part year constituted a taxable year. In such case, the following rules 
shall apply:
    (i) The amount of the ``loans acquired for investment'' for such 
part year shall be equal to the loans acquired for investment during the 
entire taxable year within which falls such part year, multiplied by a 
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such part year 
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such entire 
taxable year.
    (ii) The increase in sales of whole loans and participations 
permitted by subdivision (vi) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c), 
(relating to carryover of sales and use of preceding year's base) shall 
be the amount of such increase computed under such subdivision, 
multiplied by the fraction specified in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph.

If, treating the part year as a taxable year, the association meets all 
the requirements of this paragraph for such part year it will be 
considered to have met the business operations test for the entire 
taxable year, providing it operated in all material respects in 
conformity with applicable rules and

[[Page 520]]

regulations of Federal or State supervisory authorities for the entire 
taxable year. The 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in 
subdivision (iv)(b) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c), shall be 
applied only on the basis of a taxable year and not the part year. For 
taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, and ending before 
November 1, 1964, an association will be considered to have met the 
business operations test if it operated in all material respects in 
conformity with applicable rules and regulations of Federal or State 
supervisory authorities.
    (d) 90 percent of assets test--(1) In general. At least 90 percent 
of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan 
association must consist of the assets defined in subparagraphs (2) 
through (10) of this paragraph (d). For purposes of this paragraph, it 
is immaterial whether the association originated the loans defined in 
subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this paragraph (d), or purchased or 
otherwise acquired them in whole or in part from another. See paragraph 
(j) of this section for definition of certain terms used in this 
paragraph, and paragraph (k) of this section for the determination of 
amount and character of loans.
    (2) Cash. The term ``cash'' means cash on hand, and time or demand 
deposits with, or withdrawable accounts in, other financial 
institutions.
    (3) Governmental obligations. The term ``governmental obligations'' 
means obligations of the United States, a State or political subdivision 
of a State, and stock or obligations of a corporation which is an 
instrumentality of the United States, a State, or political subdivision 
of a State.
    (4) Deposit insurance company securities. The term ``deposit 
insurance company securities'' means certificates of deposit in, or 
obligations of, a corporation organized under a State law which 
specifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share 
accounts of member associations.
    (5) Property used in the association's business--(i) In general. The 
term ``property used in the association's business'' means land, 
buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold interests, 
leasehold improvements, and other assets used by the association in the 
conduct of its business of acquiring the savings of the public and 
investing in the loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this 
paragraph (d). Real property held for the purpose of being used 
primarily as the principal or branch office of the association 
constitutes property used in the association's business so long as it is 
reasonably anticipated that such property will be occupied for such use 
by the association, or that construction work preparatory to such 
occupancy will be commenced thereon, within 2 years after acquisition of 
the property. Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has 
as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more 
than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the 
principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used 
in such business. Real property held by an association for investment or 
sale, even for the purpose of obtaining mortgage loans thereon, does not 
constitute property used in the association's business.
    (ii) Property rented to others. Except as provided in the second 
sentence of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, property or a portion 
thereof rented by the association to others does not constitute property 
used in the association's business. However, if the fair rental value of 
the rented portion of a single piece of real property (including 
appurtenant parcels) used as the principal or branch office of the 
association constitutes less than 50 percent of the fair rental value of 
such piece of property, or if such property has an adjusted basis of not 
more than $150,000, the entire property shall be considered used in such 
business. If such rented portion constitutes 50 percent or more of the 
fair rental value of such piece of property, and such property has an 
adjusted basis of more than $150,000, an allocation of its adjusted 
basis is required. The portion of the total adjusted basis of such piece 
of property which is deemed to be property used in the association's 
business shall be equal to an amount which bears the same ratio to such 
total adjusted basis as the amount of the fair rental value of the 
portion used as the principal or

[[Page 521]]

branch office of the association bears to the total fair rental value of 
such property. In the case of all property other than real property used 
or to be used as the principal or branch office of the association, if 
the fair rental value of the rented portion thereof constitutes less 
than 15 percent of the fair rental value of such property, the entire 
property shall be considered used in the association's business. If such 
rented portion constitutes 15 percent or more of the fair rental value 
of such property, an allocation of its adjusted basis (in the same 
manner as required for real property used as the principal or branch 
office) is required.
    (6) Passbook loan. The term ``passbook loan'' means a loan to the 
extent secured by a deposit, withdrawable share, or savings account in 
the association, or share of a member of the association, with respect 
to which a distribution is allowable as a deduction under section 591.
    (7) Home loan. The term ``home loan'' means a loan secured by an 
interest in--
    (i) Improved residential real property consisting of a structure or 
structures containing, in the aggregate, no more than 4 family units.
    (ii) An individually owned family unit in a multiple-unit structure, 
the owner of which unit owns an undivided interest in the underlying 
real estate and the common elements of such structure (so-called 
condominium type).

Or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property. A 
construction loan made for the purpose of financing more than one 
structure (so-called tract financing) constitutes a home loan, providing 
no individual structure contains more than 4 family units and it is 
contemplated that, as soon as possible after completion of construction, 
the structures will become property described in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph. A construction loan secured by a structure containing more 
than 4 family units constitutes a home loan only if the structure has 
been committed to a plan of individual apartment ownership described in 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph and such plan is held out and 
advertised as such. A loan secured by a cooperative apartment building 
containing more than 4 family units does not constitute a home loan.
    (8) Church loan. The term ``church loan'' means a loan secured by an 
interest in real property which is used primarily for church purposes, 
or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property. For the 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``church purposes'' means the 
ministration of sacerdotal functions, the conduct of religious worship 
and closely associated activities designed primarily to provide 
fellowship among members of the congregation, or the instruction of 
religion. Thus, a parish hall would normally qualify as property used 
primarily for church purposes, whereas a building used primarily to 
furnish education, other than the instruction of religion, would not.
    (9) Multifamily loan. The term ``multifamily loan'' means a loan, 
other than one defined in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph (d), 
(relating to a home loan), secured by an interest in improved 
residential real property or a construction loan or improvement loan for 
such property.
    (10) Nonresidential real property loan. The term ``nonresidential 
real property loan'' means a loan, other than one defined in 
subparagraph (7), (8), or (9) of this paragraph (d), (relating 
respectively to a home loan, church loan, and multifamily loan) secured 
by an interest in real property, or a construction loan or improvement 
loan for such property.
    (e) 18 percent of assets test. Not more than 18 percent of the 
amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association 
may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) 
through (9) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, the sum of the 
amounts of the nonresidential real property loans and the assets other 
than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 18 
percent of total assets.
    (f) 36 or 41 percent of assets test-- (1) 36 percent test. Unless 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), applies, not more than 36 
percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and 
loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in 
subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d)

[[Page 522]]

of this section. Thus, unless subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), 
applies, the sum of the amounts of multifamily loans, nonresidential 
real property loans, and assets other than those defined in paragraph 
(d) of this section may not exceed 36 percent of total assets.
    (2) 41 percent test. If this subparagraph applies, not more than 41 
percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and 
loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in 
subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, if 
this subparagraph applies, the sum of the amounts of multifamily loans, 
nonresidential real property loans, and assets other than those defined 
in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 41 percent of total 
assets. See section 593(b)(5) and the regulations thereunder for the 
effect of application of this subparagraph on the allowable addition to 
the reserves for bad debts.
    (g) Taxable years for which 41 percent of assets test applies--(1) 
First taxable year. For an association's first taxable year beginning 
after October 16, 1962, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies.
    (2) Second taxable year. For an association's second taxable year 
beginning after October 16, 1962, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) 
applies if such association met all the requirements of paragraphs (b) 
through (e), (h), and either subparagraph (1) or (2) of paragraph (f) 
for its first taxable year.
    (3) Years other than first and second taxable years. For any taxable 
year of an association beginning after October 16, 1962, other than its 
first and second taxable years beginning after such date, subparagraph 
(2) of paragraph (f) applies if such association met either--
    (i) The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h) 
of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, or
    (ii) The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(2), and (h) 
of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, and the 
requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h) of this 
section for the second preceding taxable year.

Thus, in years other than its first and second taxable years beginning 
after October 16, 1962, an association may apply the 41 percent of 
assets test for 2 consecutive years, but only if it met the 36 percent 
test (and all other tests) for the year previous to the 2 consecutive 
years.
    (4) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (f) and this paragraph may 
be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed 
that the association at all times meets all the requirements of 
paragraphs (b) through (e) and (h) of this section and files its returns 
on a calendar year basis.

    Example 1. An association has 41 percent of its assets invested in 
assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of 
paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1963 and 1964. Because 
1963 is its first taxable year beginning after October 16, 1962, the 41 
percent of assets test applies, and the association therefore qualifies 
as a domestic building and loan association for 1963. Because 1964 is 
its second taxable year beginning after such date and the 41 percent of 
assets test applied for its first taxable year, the 41 percent of assets 
test applies for 1964 and it therefor qualifies for such year.
    Example 2. An association has 36 percent of its assets invested in 
assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of 
paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1964, and 41 percent as 
of the close of 1965, 1966, and 1967. The association qualifies in 1965 
because, as a result of having met the 36 percent of assets test for the 
immediately preceding taxable year (1964), the 41 percent of assets test 
applies to 1965. It qualifies in 1966 because as a result of having met 
the 41 percent of assets test in the immediately preceding taxable year 
(1965) and the 36 percent of assets test in the second preceding taxable 
year (1964), the 41 percent of assets test applies to 1966. The 
association would not qualify in 1967, however, because, although it met 
the 41 percent of assets test for the immediately preceding taxable year 
(1966), it did not meet the 36 percent of assets test in the second 
preceding taxable year (1965), and therefore the 41 percent of assets 
test does not apply to 1967.
    Example 3. An association has more than 41 percent of its assets 
invested in assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through 
(8) of paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1963, and 41 
percent invested in such assets as of the close of 1964. The association 
does not qualify in either year. It does not qualify in 1963 because it 
exceeded the 41 percent limitation, and it does not qualify in 1964 
because the 41 percent of assets test does not apply to 1964 since the 
association did not meet either the 41 percent

[[Page 523]]

of assets test or the 36 percent of assets test in the prior year 
(1963).

    (h) 3 percent of assets test. Not more than 3 percent of the amount 
of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may 
consist of stock of any corporation, unless such stock is property which 
is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The stock which constitutes 
property defined in such paragraph (d) is:
    (1) Stock representing a withdrawable account in another financial 
institution;
    (2) Stock of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United 
States or of a State or political subdivision thereof;
    (3) Stock which was security for a loan and which, by reason of 
having been bid in at foreclosure or otherwise having been reduced to 
ownership or possession of the association, is a loan within the 
definition of such term in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and
    (4) Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has as its 
exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more than 50 
percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the principal or 
branch office of the association.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Definition of certain terms. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Loan. The term ``loan'' means debt, as the term ``debt'' is used 
in section 166 and the regulations thereunder. The term ``loan'' also 
includes a redeemable ground rent (as defined in section 1055(c)) which 
is owned by the taxpayer, and any property (referred to in this section 
as ``foreclosed property'') which was security for the payment of any 
indebtedness and which has been bid in at foreclosure, or otherwise been 
reduced to ownership or possession of the association by agreement or 
process of law, whether or not such property was acquired subsequent to 
December 31, 1962.
    (2) Secured. A loan will be considered as ``secured'' only if the 
loan is on the security of any instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of 
trust, or land contract) which makes the interest of the debtor in the 
property described therein specific security for the payment of the 
loan, provided that such instrument is of such a nature that, in the 
event of default, the interest of the debtor in such property could be 
subjected to the satisfaction of the loan with the same priority as a 
mortgage or deed of trust in the jurisdiction in which the property is 
situated.
    (3) Interest. The word ``interest'' means an interest in real 
property which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property 
is situated, constitutes either (i) an interest in fee in such property, 
(ii) a leasehold interest in such property extending or renewable 
automatically for a period of at least 30 years, or at least 10 years 
beyond the date scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an 
interest in such property, (iii) a leasehold interest in property 
described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section (relating to certain 
home loans) extending for a period of at least 2 years beyond the date 
scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an interest in such 
property or (iv) a leasehold interest in such property held subject to a 
redeemable ground rent defined in section 1055(c).
    (4) Real property. The term ``real property'' means any property 
which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property is 
situated, constitutes real property.
    (5) Improved real property. The term ``improved real property'' 
means--
    (i) Land on which is located any building of a permanent nature 
(such as a house, apartment house, office building, hospital, shopping 
center, warehouse, garage, or other similar permanent structure), 
provided that the value of such building is substantial in relation to 
the value of such land;
    (ii) Any building lot or site which, by reason of installations and 
improvements that have been completed in keeping with applicable 
governmental requirements and with general practice in the community, is 
a building lot or site ready for the construction of any building of a 
permanent nature within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph; or
    (iii) Real property which, because of its state of improvement, 
produces sufficient income to maintain such real

[[Page 524]]

property and retire the loan in accordance with the terms thereof.
    (6) Construction loan. The term ``construction loan'' means a loan, 
the proceeds of which are to be disbursed to the borrower (either by the 
association or a third party) as construction work progresses on real 
property which is security for the loan, which property is, or from the 
proceeds of such loan will become, improved real property.
    (7) Improvement loan. The term ``improvement loan'' means a loan 
which, by its terms and conditions, requires that the proceeds of the 
loan be used for altering, repairing, or improving real property. If 
more than 85 percent of the proceeds of a single loan are to be used for 
such purposes, the entire loan will qualify. If 85 percent or less of 
the proceeds of a loan are to be used for such purposes, an allocation 
of its adjusted basis is required. Examples of loans which constitute 
improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of painting a house, 
adding a new room to a house, remodeling the lobby of an apartment 
building, and purchasing and installing storm windows, storm doors, and 
awnings. Examples of loans which do not constitute improvement loans are 
loans made for the purpose of purchasing draperies, and removable 
appliances, such as refrigerators, ranges, and washing machines. It is 
not necessary that a loan be secured by the real property which is 
altered, repaired, or improved.
    (8) Residential real property. The term ``residential real 
property'' means real property which consists of one or more family 
units. A family unit is a building or portion thereof which contains 
complete living facilities which are to be used on other than a 
transient basis by only one family consisting of one or more persons. 
Thus, an apartment which is to be used on other than a transient basis 
by one family, which contains complete facilities for living, sleeping, 
eating, cooking, and sanitation constitutes a family unit. Hotels, 
motels, dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, rooming houses, 
hospitals, sanitariums, rest homes, and parks and courts for mobile 
homes do not normally constitute residential real property.
    (k) Amount and character of loans--(1) Treatment at time of 
determination--(i) In general. The amount of a loan, as of the time the 
determination required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (k), is 
made, shall be treated for the purposes of this section as being 
secured:
    (a) First by the portion of property, if any, defined in 
subparagraph (6), (7), or (8) of paragraph (d) of this section to the 
extent of the loan value thereof;
    (b) Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph 
(9) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value 
thereof; and
    (c) Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph 
(10) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value 
thereof.

To the extent that the amount of a loan exceeds the amount treated as 
being secured by property defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of 
paragraph (d) of this section, such loan shall be treated as property 
not defined in paragraph (d) of this section. If the loan value of any 
one category of property defined in paragraph (d) of this section 
exceeds 85 percent of the amount of the loan for which it is security 
then the entire loan shall be treated as a loan secured by such 
property.
    (ii) Loans of $40,000 or less. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, in the case of loans amounting to 
$40,000 or less as of the time of a determination, made on the security 
of property which is a combination of two or more categories or property 
defined in subparagraph (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this 
section, all such loans for any taxable year may, at the option of the 
association, be treated for the purposes of this section as being 
secured by the category of property the loan value of which constitutes 
the largest percentage of the total loan value of the property except to 
the extent that the loan is treated as property not defined in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (iii) Home loans of $20,000 or less. Notwithstanding the provisions 
of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, if a loan amounting 
to $20,000 or less as of the time of a determination, is secured partly 
by property of a category described in subparagraph (7) of paragraph (d) 
of this section (relating to a

[[Page 525]]

home loan), the amount of the loan shall, for the purposes of this 
section, be treated as a loan described in such subparagraph except to 
the extent that the loan is treated as property not defined in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (2) Treatment subsequent to time of determination. The amount of a 
loan outstanding as of any time subsequent to the time of a 
determination shall be treated, for the purposes of this section, as 
being secured by each of the categories of property in the same ratio 
that the amount which was treated as being secured by each category bore 
to the total amount of the loan at the time as of which the 
determination was last made with respect to such loan.
    (3) Time of determination--(i) In general. The determination of the 
amount of a loan which is treated as being secured by each of the 
categories of property shall be made:
    (a) As of the time a loan is made;
    (b) As of the time a loan is increased;
    (c) As of the time any portion of the property which was security 
for the loan is released; and
    (d) As of any time required by applicable Federal or State 
regulatory authorities for reappraisal or reanalysis of such loans.
    (ii) Special rule. In the case of loans outstanding with respect to 
which no event described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph has 
occurred in a taxable year beginning on or after October 17, 1962, the 
determination of the amounts of such loans which are treated as being 
secured by each of the categories of property may be made, at the option 
of the association, as of the close of the first taxable year beginning 
on or after such date, providing the determinations with respect to all 
such loans are made as of such date.
    (4) Loan value. The loan value of property which is security for a 
loan is the maximum amount at the time as of which the determination is 
made which the association is permitted to lend on such property under 
the rules and regulations of applicable Federal and State regulatory 
authorities. Such loan value shall not exceed the fair market value of 
such property at such time as determined under such rules and 
regulations. However, in the case of loans made incidentally with and as 
a part of a bona fide salvage operation, the loan value of the security 
property shall be considered to be the face amount of the loan where the 
loan can be shown by the association to have been made for the primary 
purpose of recovering the investment of the association, and where such 
salvage operation is in conformity with rules and regulations of 
applicable Federal or State regulatory authorities.
    (5) Examples. The following examples, in each of which it is assumed 
that X Savings and Loan Association files its return on a calendar year 
basis, illustrate the application of the rules in this paragraph:

    Example 1. On July 1, 1963, X makes a single loan of $1 million to M 
Corporation which loan is secured by real property which is a 
combination of homes, apartments, and stores. As of the time the loan is 
made X determines that the loan values of the categories of property are 
as follows:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Category of property                      Loan value   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Home.................................................           $400,000
Multifamily..........................................            420,000
Nonresidential real property.........................            240,000
                                                      ------------------
    Total............................................          1,060,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of the time the loan is made, therefore, the $1,000,000 loan is 
treated under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph as being secured as 
follows:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   Amount of  Percentage
                 Category of loan                     loan     of total 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Home loan........................................   $400,000          40
Multifamily loan.................................    420,000          42
Nonresidential real property loan................    180,000          18
                                                  ------------          
    Total........................................  1,000,000         100
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming that the $1 million loan to M was reduced to $900,000 as of the 
close of 1963, that there were no increases in the amount of the loan 
and no releases of property which was security for the loan, and that 
there was no regulatory requirement to reappraise or reanalyze the loan, 
such loan will be considered under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to 
be secured, as of the close of 1963, as follows:

[[Page 526]]



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            Percentage as        Amount as of Dec. 31, 1963     
                                                               of last    --------------------------------------
                         Category                           determination                                       
                                                             July 1, 1963                                       
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Home......................................................          40                $360,000  (40% x $900,000)
Multifamily...............................................          42                 378,000  (42% x $900,000)
Nonresidential real property..............................          18                 162,000  (18% x $900,000)
                                                           ------------------------------------                 
    Total.................................................                             900,000                  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example 2. X makes a loan of $40,000 secured by a building which 
contains a store on the first floor and four family units on the upper 
floors. The loan value of the part of the building used as a store is 
$21,000 and the loan value of the residential portion is $23,000. The 
loan will be treated under subdivision (i) of subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph as a loan secured by residential real property containing four 
or fewer family units to the extent of $23,000, and by nonresidential 
property to the extent of $17,000, as of the time the loan is made. 
However, if X exercises the option to treat all loans of $40,000 or less 
in accordance with subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, this loan would be treated as a home loan to the extent of 
the full $40,000 because the loan value of the residential portion is 
larger than the loan value of the nonresidential part.

    (l) Computation of percentages--(1) In general. The percentages 
specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section shall, except as 
provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l), be computed by 
comparing the amount of the assets described in each paragraph as of the 
close of the taxable year with the total amount of assets as of the 
close of the taxable year. The amount of the assets in any category and 
the total amount of assets shall be determined with reference to their 
adjusted basis under Sec. 1.1011-1, or by such other method as is in 
accordance with sound accounting principles, provided such method is 
used in valuing all the assets in a taxable year.
    (2) Treatment of certain assets and reserves. For purposes of this 
paragraph (l):
    (i) Reserves for bad debts established pursuant to section 593, or 
corresponding provisions of prior law, and the regulations thereunder 
shall not constitute a reduction of total assets, but shall be treated 
as a surplus or net worth item.
    (ii) The adjusted basis of a ``loan in process'' does not include 
the unadvanced portion of such loan.
    (iii) Advances made by the association for taxes, insurance, etc., 
on loans shall be treated as being in the same category as the loan with 
respect to which the advances are made (irrespective of whether the 
advances are secured by the property securing the loan).
    (iv) Interest receivable included in gross income shall be treated 
as being in the same category as the loan or asset with respect to which 
it is earned.
    (v) The unamortized portion of premiums paid on mortgage loans 
acquired by the association shall be considered part of the acquisition 
cost of such loans.
    (vi) Prepaid Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation premiums 
shall be treated as being governmental obligations defined in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section.
    (vii) Accounts receivable (other than accrued interest receivable), 
and prepaid expenses and deferred charges other than those referred to 
in subdivision (v) or (vi) of this subparagraph, shall be disregarded 
both as separate categories and in the computation of total assets.
    (viii) Foreclosed property (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section) shall be treated as having the same character as the loan for 
which it was given as security.
    (3) Alternative method. At the option of the taxpayer, the 
percentages specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section may 
be computed on the basis of the average assets outstanding during the 
taxable year. Such average shall be determined by making the

[[Page 527]]

computation provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (l), either 
as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or 
semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of 
the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained for each 
category. The method selected must be applied uniformly for the taxable 
year to all categories of assets, but the method may be changed from 
year to year.
    (4) Acquisition of certain assets. For the purpose of the annual 
computation of percentages under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(l)--
    (i) Assets which, within a 60-day period beginning in one taxable 
year of the taxpayer and ending in the next year, are acquired directly 
or indirectly through borrowing and then repaid or disposed of within 
such period, shall be considered assets other than those defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section, unless both the acquisition and 
disposition are established to the satisfaction of the district director 
to have been for bona fide purposes; and
    (ii) The amount of cash shall not include amounts received directly 
or indirectly from another financial institution (other than a Federal 
Home Loan Bank or a similar institution organized under State law) to 
the extent of the amount of cash which an association has on deposit or 
holds as a withdrawable account in such other financial institution.
    (5) Reporting requirements. In the case of income tax returns for 
taxable years ending after October 31, 1964, there shall be filed with 
the return a statement showing the amount of assets as of the close of 
the taxable year in each of the categories defined in paragraph (d), and 
in the category described in paragraph (h) of this section, and a brief 
description and amount of all other assets. If the alternative method of 
computing percentages under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l) is 
selected, such statement shall show such information as of the end of 
each month, each quarter, or semiannually and the manner of calculating 
the averages. With respect to taxable years beginning after October 16, 
1962, and ending before November 1, 1964, taxpayers shall maintain 
adequate records to establish to the satisfaction of the district 
director that it meets the various assets tests specified in this 
section.
    (6) Example. The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example in which a description of the assets, the 
subparagraph of paragraph (d) in which the assets are defined, the 
amount of the assets, and the percentage of the total assets included in 
the calculation are set forth.

                           Savings and Loan Association Assets as of December 31, 1964

    At the option of the association, the computations listed above 
could have been made as of the close of each month, each quarter, or 
semiannually, and averaged for the entire year.
    (m) Taxable years beginning before October 17, 1962. For taxable 
years beginning before October 17, 1962, the term ``domestic building 
and loan association'' means a domestic building and loan association, a 
domestic savings and loan association, and a Federal savings and loan 
association substantially all the business of which is confined to 
making loans to members.

[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7622, 44 FR 28661, May 
16, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7701-13A  Post-1969 domestic building and loan association.

    (a) In general. For taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, the 
term ``domestic building and loan association'' means a domestic 
building and loan association, a domestic savings and loan association, 
a Federal savings and loan association, and any other savings 
institution chartered and supervised as a savings and loan or similar 
association under Federal or State law which meets the supervisory test 
(described in paragraph (b) of this section), the business operations 
test (described in paragraph (c) of this section), and the assets test 
(described in paragraph (d) of this section). For the definition of the 
term ``domestic building and loan association'' for taxable years 
beginning after October 16, 1962, and before July 12, 1969, see 
Sec. 301.7701-13.
    (b) Supervisory test. A domestic building and loan association must 
be either (1) an insured institution within the meaning of section 
401(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724(a)) or (2) subject by 
law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority having 
supervision over such associations. An ``insured institution'' is one 
the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corporation.
    (c) Business operations test--(1) In general. An association must 
utilize its assets so that its business consists principally of 
acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans. The 
requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the 
business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the 
public and investing in loans includes ancillary or incidental 
activities which are directly and primarily related to such acquisition 
and investment, such as advertising for savings, appraising property on 
which loans are to be made by the association, and inspecting the 
progress of construction in connection with construction loans. Even 
though an association meets the supervisory test described in paragraph 
(b) of this section and the assets test described in paragraph (d) of 
this section, it will nevertheless not qualify as a domestic building 
and loan association if it does not meet the requirements of both 
paragraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (c), relating, respectively, to 
acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans.
    (2) Acquiring the savings of the public. The requirement that an 
association's business (other than investing in loans) must consist 
principally of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily will be 
considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material respects in 
conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory 
authority. Alternatively, such requirement will be considered to be met 
if more than 75 percent of the dollar amount of the total deposits, 
withdrawable

[[Page 529]]

shares, and other obligations of the association are held during the 
taxable year by the general public, as opposed to amounts deposited or 
held by family or related business groups or persons who are officers or 
directors of the association. However, the preceding sentence shall not 
apply if the dollar amount of other obligations of the association 
outstanding during the taxable year exceeds 25 percent of the dollar 
amount of the total deposits, withdrawable shares, and other obligations 
of the association outstanding during such year. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term ``other obligations'' means notes, bonds, 
debentures, or other obligations, or other securities (except capital 
stock), issued by an association in conformity with the rules and 
regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or substantially 
equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory authority. The term 
``other obligations'' does not include an advance made by a Federal Home 
Loan Bank under the authority of section 10 or 10b of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430, 1430b) as amended and supplemented. Both 
percentages specified in this paragraph shall be computed either as of 
the close of the taxable year or, at the option of the taxpayer, on the 
basis of the average of the dollar amounts of the total deposits, 
withdrawable shares, and other obligations of the association held 
during the taxable year. Such averages shall be determined by computing 
each percentage specified either as of the close of each month, as of 
the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and 
by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual 
percentages obtained. The method selected must be applied uniformly for 
the taxable year to both percentages, but the method may be changed from 
year to year.
    (3) Investing in loans--(i) In general. The requirement that an 
association's business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) 
must consist principally of investing in loans will be considered to be 
met for a taxable year only if more than 75 percent of the gross income 
of the association consists of--
    (a) Interest or dividends on assets defined in paragraphs (1), (2), 
and (3) of paragraph (e) of this section,
    (b) Interest on loans,
    (c) Income attributable to the portion of property used in the 
association's business, as defined in paragraph (e)(11) of this section,
    (d) So much of the amount of premiums, discounts, commissions, or 
fees (including late charges and penalties) on loans which have at some 
time been held by the association, or for which firm commitments have 
been issued, as is not in excess of 20 percent of the gross income of 
the association,
    (e) Net gain from sales and exchanges of governmental obligations, 
as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or
    (f) Income, gain or loss attributable to foreclosed property, as 
defined in paragraph (e)(9) of this section, but not including such 
income, gain or loss which, pursuant to section 595 and the regulations 
thereunder, is not included in gross income.

Examples of types of income which would cause an association to fail to 
meet the requirements of this paragraph if, in the aggregate, they equal 
or exceed 25 percent of gross income, are: The excess of gains over 
losses from sales of real property (other than foreclosed property); 
rental income (other than on foreclosed property and the portion of 
property used in the association's business); premiums, commissions, and 
fees (other than commitment fees) on loans which have never been held by 
the association; and insurance brokerage fees.
    (ii) Computation of gross income. For purposes of this paragraph, 
gross income is computed without regard to--
    (a) Gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the portion of property 
used in the association's business as defined in paragraph (e)(11) of 
this section.
    (b) Gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the rented portion of 
property used as the principal or branch office of the association, as 
defined in paragraph (e)(11) of this section, and
    (c) Gains or losses on sales of participations, and loans, other 
than governmental obligations defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section.


[[Page 530]]


For purposes of this paragraph, gross income is also computed without 
regard to items of income which an association establishes arise out of 
transactions which are necessitated by exceptional circumstances and 
which are not undertaken as recurring business activities for profit. 
Thus, for example, an association would meet the investing in loans 
requirement if it can establish that it would otherwise fail to meet 
that requirement solely because of the receipt of a nonrecurring item of 
income due to exceptional circumstances. For this purpose, transactions 
necessitated by an excess of demand for loans over savings capital in 
the association's area are not to be deemed to be necessitated by 
exceptional circumstances. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(c) of 
this section, the term ``sales of participations'' means sales by an 
association of interests in loans, which sales meet the requirements of 
the regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board relating to sales of 
participations, or which meet substantially equivalent requirements of 
State law or regulations relating to sales of participations.
    (iii) Reporting requirement. In the case of income tax returns for 
taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, there is required to be 
filed with the return a statement showing the amount of gross income for 
the taxable year in each of the categories described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i) of this section.
    (d) 60 percent of assets test. At least 60 percent of the amount of 
the total assets of a domestic building and loan association must 
consist of the assets defined in paragraph (e) of this section. The 
percentage specified in this paragraph is computed as of the close of 
the taxable year or, at the option of the taxpayer, may be computed on 
the basis of the average assets outstanding during the taxable year. 
Such average is determined by making the appropriate computation 
described in this section either as of the close of each month, as of 
the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and 
by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual 
percentage obtained for each category of assets defined in paragraph (e) 
of this section. The method selected must be applied uniformly for the 
taxable year to all categories of assets, but the method may be changed 
from year to year. For purposes of this paragraph, it is immaterial 
whether the association originated the loans defined in paragraphs (4) 
through (8) and (10) of paragraph (e) of this section or purchased or 
otherwise acquired them in whole or in part from another. See paragraph 
(f) of this section for definition of certain terms used in this 
paragraph and in paragraph (e) of this section, and for the 
determination of amount and character of loans.
    (e) Assets defined. The assets defined in this paragraph are--
    (1) Cash. The term ``cash'' means cash on hand, and time or demand 
deposits with, or withdrawable accounts in, other financial 
institutions.
    (2) Governmental obligations. The term ``governmental obligations'' 
means--
    (i) Obligations of the United States,
    (ii) Obligations of a State or political subdivision of a State, and
    (iii) Stock or obligations of a corporation which is an 
instrumentality of the United States, a State, or a political 
subdivision of a State,

other than obligations the interest on which is excludable from gross 
income under section 103 and the regulations thereunder.
    (3) Deposit insurance company securities. The term ``deposit 
insurance company securities'' means certificates of deposit in, or 
obligations of, a corporation organized under a State law which 
specifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share 
accounts of member associations.
    (4) Passbook loan. The term ``passbook loan'' means a loan to the 
extent secured by a deposit, withdrawable share, or savings account in 
the association, or share of a member of the association, with respect 
to which a distribution is allowable as a deduction under section 591.
    (5) Residential real property loan. [Reserved]
    (6) Church loan. [Reserved]
    (7) Urban renewal loan. [Reserved]
    (8) Institutional loan. [Reserved]
    (9) Foreclosed property. [Reserved]
    (10) Educational loan. [Reserved]

[[Page 531]]

    (11) Property used in the association's business--(i) In general. 
The term ``property used in the association's business'' means land, 
buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold interests, 
leasehold improvements, and other assests used by the association in the 
conduct of its business of acquiring the savings of the public and 
investing in loans. Real property held for the purpose of being used 
primarily as the principal or branch office of the association 
constitutes property used in the association's business so long as it is 
reasonably anticipated that such property will be occupied for such use 
by the association, or that construction work preparatory to such 
occupancy will be commenced thereon, within 2 years after acquisition of 
the property. Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has 
as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more 
than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the 
principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used 
in such business. Real property held by an association for investment or 
sale, even for the purpose of obtaining mortgage loans thereon, does not 
constitute property used in the association's business.
    (ii) Property rented to others. Except as provided in the second 
sentence of paragraph (11)(i) of this paragraph (e), property or a 
portion thereof rented by the association to others does not constitute 
property used in the association's business. However, if the fair rental 
value of the rented portion of a single piece of real property 
(including appurtenant parcels) used as the principal or branch office 
of the association constitutes less than 50 percent of the fair rental 
value of such piece of property, or if such property has an adjusted 
basis of not more than $150,000, the entire property shall be considered 
used in such business. If such rented portion constitutes 50 percent or 
more of the fair rental value of such piece of property, and such 
property has an adjusted basis of more than $150,000, an allocation of 
its adjusted basis is required. The portion of the total adjusted basis 
of such piece of property which is deemed to be property used in the 
association's business shall be equal to an amount which bears the same 
ratio to such total adjusted basis as the amount of the fair rental 
value of the portion used as the principal or branch office of the 
association bears to the total fair rental value of such property. In 
the case of all property other than real property used or to be used as 
the principal or branch office of the association, if the fair rental 
value of the rented portion thereof constitutes less than 15 percent of 
the fair rental value of such property, the entire property shall be 
considered used in the association's business. If such rented portion 
constitutes 15 percent or more of the fair rental value of such 
property, an allocation of its adjusted basis (in the same manner as 
required for real property used as the principal or branch office) is 
required.
    (12) Regular or residual interest in a REMIC--(i) In general. If for 
any calendar quarter at least 95 percent of a REMIC's assets (as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii) or Sec. 1.6049-
7(f)(3) of this chapter) are assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through 
(e)(11) of this section, then for that calendar quarter all the regular 
and residual interests in that REMIC are treated as assets defined in 
this paragraph (e). If less than 95 percent of a REMIC's assets are 
assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section, the 
percentage of each REMIC regular or residual interest treated as an 
asset defined in this paragraph (e) is equal to the percentage of the 
REMIC's assets that are assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through 
(e)(11) of this section. See Secs. 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii)(B) and 1.6049-
7(f)(3) of this chapter for information required to be provided to 
regular and residual interest holders if the 95 percent test is not met.
    (ii) Loans secured by manufactured housing. For purposes of 
paragraph (e)(12)(i) of this section, a loan secured by manufactured 
housing treated as a single family residence under section 25(e)(10) is 
an asset defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section.
    (f) Special rules. [Reserved]

Sec. 301.7701-14  Cooperative bank.

    For taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, the term 
``cooperative bank'' means an institution without capital stock 
organized and operated for mutual purposes without profit which meets 
the supervisory test, the business operations test, and the various 
assets tests specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of Sec. 301.7701-
13, employing the rules and definitions of paragraphs (j) through (l) of 
that section. In applying paragraphs (b) through (l) of such section any 
references to an ``association'' or to a ``domestic building and loan 
association'' shall be deemed to be a reference to a cooperative bank.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7701-15  Income tax return preparer.

    (a) In general. An income tax return preparer is any person who 
prepares for compensation, or who employs (or engages) one or more 
persons to prepare for compensation, other than for the person, all or a 
substantial portion of any return of tax under Subtitle A of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or of any claim for refund of tax under 
Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (1) A person who furnishes to a taxpayer or other preparer 
sufficient information and advice so that completion of the return or 
claim for refund is largely a mechanical or clerical matter is 
considered an income tax return preparer, even though that person does 
not actually place or review placement of information on the return or 
claim for refund. See also paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) A person who only gives advice on specific issues of law shall 
not be considered an income tax return preparer, unless--
    (i) The advice is given with respect to events which have occurred 
at the time the advice is rendered and is not given with respect to the 
consequences of contemplated actions; and
    (ii) The advice is directly relevant to the determination of the 
existence, characterization, or amount of an entry on a return or claim 
for refund. For example, if a lawyer gives an opinion on a transaction 
which a corporation has consummated, solely to satisfy an accountant 
(not at the time a preparer of the corporation's return) who is 
attempting to determine whether the reserve for taxes set forth in the 
corporation's financial statement is reasonable, the lawyer shall not be 
considered a tax return preparer solely by reason of rendering such 
opinion.
    (3) A person may be an income tax return preparer without regard to 
educational qualifications and professional status requirements.
    (4) A person must prepare a return or claim for refund for 
compensation to be an income tax return preparer. A person who prepares 
a return or claim for refund for a taxpayer with no explicit or implicit 
agreement for compensation is not a preparer, even though the person 
receives a gift or return service or favor.
    (5) A person who prepares a return or claim for refund outside the 
United States is an income tax return preparer, regardless of his 
nationality, residence, or the locations of his places of business, if 
the person otherwise satisfies the definition of income tax return 
preparer. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 301.6109-1(g), the 
person shall secure an employer identification number if he is an 
employer of another preparer, is a partnership in which one or more of 
the general partners is a preparer, or is an individual not employed (or 
engaged) by another preparer. The person shall comply with the 
provisions of section 1203 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 and the 
regulations thereunder.
    (6) An official or employee of the Internal Revenue Service 
performing his official duties is not an income tax return preparer.
    (7) The following persons are not income tax return preparers:
    (i) Any individual who provides tax assistance under a Volunteer 
Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program established by the Internal Revenue 
Service;
    (ii) Any organization sponsoring or administering a Volunteer Income 
Tax Assistance (VITA) program established by the Internal Revenue 
Service, but only with respect to that sponsorship or administration;

[[Page 533]]

    (iii) Any individual who provides tax counseling for the elderly 
under a program established pursuant to section 163 of the Revenue Act 
of 1978; and
    (iv) Any organization sponsoring or administering a program to 
provide tax counseling for the elderly established pursuant to section 
163 of the Revenue Act of 1978, but only with respect to that 
sponsorship or administration.
    (b) Substantial preparation. (1) Only a person (or persons acting in 
concert) who prepares all or a substantial portion of a return or claim 
for refund shall be considered to be a preparer (or preparers) of the 
return or claim for refund. A person who renders advice which is 
directly relevant to the determination of the existence, 
characterization, or amount of an entry on a return or claim for refund, 
will be regarded as having prepared that entry. Whether a schedule, 
entry, or other portion of a return or claim for refund is a substantial 
portion is determined by comparing the length and complexity of, and the 
tax liability or refund involved in, that portion to the length and 
complexity of, and tax liability or refund involved in, the return or 
claim for refund as a whole.
    (2) For purposes of applying the rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, if the schedule, entry, or other portion of the return or claim 
for refund involves amounts of gross income, amounts of deductions, or 
amounts on the basis of which credits are determined which are--
    (i) Less than $2,000; or
    (ii) Less than $100,000, and also less than 20 percent of the gross 
income (or adjusted gross income if the taxpayer is an individual) as 
shown on the return or claim for refund,

then the schedule or other portion is not considered to be a substantial 
portion. If more than one schedule, entry or other portion is involved, 
they shall be aggregated in applying the rule of this paragraph (b)(2). 
Thus, if a person, for an individual taxpayer's return, prepares a 
schedule for dividend income which totals $1,500 and gives advice making 
him a preparer of a schedule of medical expenses which results in a 
deduction for medical expenses of $1,500, the person is not a preparer 
if the taxpayer's adjusted gross income shown on the return is more than 
$15,000. This paragraph shall not apply to a person who prepares all of 
a return or claim for refund.
    (3) A preparer of a return is not considered to be a preparer of 
another return merely because an entry or entries reported on the return 
may affect an entry reported on the other return, unless the entry or 
entries reported on the prepared return are directly reflected on the 
other return and constitute a substantial portion of the other return. 
For example, the sole preparer of a partnership return of income or a 
small business corporation income tax return is considered a preparer of 
a partner's or a shareholder's return if the entry or entries on the 
partnership or small business corporation return reportable on the 
partner's or shareholder's return constitute a substantial portion of 
the partner's or shareholder's return.
    (c) Return and claim for refund--(1) Return. A return of tax under 
Subtitle A is a return filed by or on behalf of a taxpayer reporting the 
liability of the taxpayer for tax under Subtitle A. A return of tax 
under Subtitle A also includes an information return filed by or on 
behalf of a person or entity that is not a taxable entity and which 
reports information which is or may be reported on the return of a 
taxpayer of tax under Subtitle A.
    (i) A return of tax under Subtitle A includes an individual or 
corporation income tax return, a fiduciary income tax return (for a 
trust or estate), a regulated investment company undistributed capital 
gains tax return, a return of a charitable remainder trust, a return by 
a transferor of stock or securities to a foreign corporation, foreign 
trust, or foreign partnership, a partnership return of income, a small 
business corporation income tax return, and a DISC return.
    (ii) A return of tax under Subtitle A does not include an estate tax 
return, a gift tax return, any other return of excise taxes or income 
taxes collected at source on wages, an individual or corporation 
declaration of estimated tax, an application for an extension of time to 
file an individual or corporation income tax return, or an information

[[Page 534]]

statement on Form 990, any Form 1099, or similar form.
    (2) Claim for refund. A claim for refund of tax under Subtitle A 
includes a claim for credit against any tax under Subtitle A.
    (d) Persons who are not preparers. A person shall not be considered 
to be a preparer of a return or claim for refund if the person performs 
only one or more of the following services:
    (1) Typing, reproduction, or other mechanical assistance in the 
preparation of a return or claim for refund.
    (2) Preparation of a return or claim for refund of a person, or an 
officer, a general partner, or employee of a person, by whom the 
individual is regularly and continuously employed or in which the 
individual is a general partner.
    (3) Preparation of a return or claim for refund for a trust or 
estate of which the person either is a fiduciary or is an officer, 
general partner, or employee of the fiduciary.
    (4) Preparation of a claim for refund for a taxpayer in response 
to--
    (i) A notice of deficiency issued to the taxpayer; or
    (ii) A waiver of restriction after initiation of an audit of the 
taxpayer or another taxpayer if a determination in the audit of the 
other taxpayer affects, directly or indirectly, the liability of the 
taxpayer for tax under Subtitle A.

For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the employee of a 
corporation owning more than 50 percent of the voting power of another 
corporation, or the employee of a corporation more than 50 percent of 
the voting power of which is owned by another corporation, is considered 
the employee of the other corporation as well. For purposes of paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section, an estate, guardianship, conservatorship, 
committee, and any similar arrangement for a taxpayer under a legal 
disability (such as a minor, an incompetent, or an infirm individual) is 
considered a trust or estate.

Sec. 301.7701-17T  Collective-bargaining plans and agreements (temporary).

    Q-1: How did the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA of 1984) change the 
laws with respect to plans that are maintained pursuant to collective 
bargaining agreements?
    A-1: (a) Many of the requirements and rules applicable to deferred 
compensation and welfare benefit plans are different for plans 
maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Prior to the 
TRA of 1984, the Internal Revenue Code provided no clear definition of 
an employee representative or whether there is a collective bargaining 
agreement between such employee representative and one or more 
employers.
    (b) Section 526(c) of the TRA of 1984 added a new condition under a 
new section 7701(a)(46) that must be satisfied in order for a plan to be 
considered to be a plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining 
agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers for 
purposes of the Code after March 31, 1984. If more than one-half of the 
membership of an organization is comprised of owners, officers, and 
executives of employers covered by the plan, then such organization is 
not an employee representative for purposes of determining whether a 
plan is to be treated as maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining 
agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers. 
Whether an individual is an owner, officer or executive is to be 
determined separately with respect to each employer. Additionally, 
section 7701(a)(46) provides that the Internal Revenue Service shall 
make the determination for purposes of the Code as to whether there is a 
collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one 
or more employers.

[[Page 535]]

    Q-2: If an organization does not fail to be an employee 
representative under the 50 percent or less test of section 7701(a)(46), 
is a plan maintained pursuant to an agreement between such organization 
and one or more employers necessarily treated, under the Code, as a plan 
maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between an 
employee representative and one or more employers?
    A-2: (a) No.
    (b) Specific Code provisions generally require other conditions than 
that in section 7701(a)(46) to be satisfied in order for a plan to be 
considered to be collectively-bargained. For example, in order for a 
plan to be described in section 413(a), the Secretary of Labor must find 
that the plan is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining 
agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers.
    (c) Even if (1) the finding in the example in the preceding 
paragraph (b) is made by the Secretary of Labor, (2) the union has been 
recognized as exempt under section 501(c)(5), and (3) the percentage 
condition in section 7701(a)(46) is satisfied, the Internal Revenue 
Service has the authority, pursuant to section 7701(a)(46), to determine 
whether there is a collective bargaining agreement under the Code.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(b)-1  Resident alien.

    (a) Scope. Section 301.7701(b)-1(b) provides rules for determining 
whether an alien individual is a lawful permanent resident of the United 
States. Section 301.7701(b)-1(c) provides rules for determining if an 
alien individual satisfies the substantial presence test. Section 
301.7701(b)-2 provides rules for determining when an alien individual 
will be considered to maintain a tax home in a foreign country and to 
have a closer connection to that foreign country. Section 301.7701(b)-3 
provides rules for determining if an individual is an exempt individual 
because of his or her status as a foreign government-related individual, 
teacher, trainee, student, or professional athlete. Section 301.7701(b)-
3 also provides rules for determining whether an individual may exclude 
days of presence in the United States because the individual was unable 
to leave the United States because of a medical condition. Section 
301.7701(b)-4 provides rules for determining an individual's residency 
starting and termination dates. Section 301.7701(b)-5 provides rules for 
applying section 877 to a nonresident alien individual. Section 
301.7701(b)-6 provides rules for determining the taxable year of an 
alien. Section 301.7701(b)-7 provides rules for determining the effect 
of these regulations on rules in tax conventions to which the United 
States is a party. Section 301.7701(b)-8 provides procedural rules for 
establishing that an individual is a nonresident alien. Section 
301.7701(b)-9 provides the effective dates of section 7701(b) and the 
regulations under that section. Unless the context indicates otherwise, 
the regulations under Secs. 301.7701(b)-1 through 301.7701(b)-9 apply 
for purposes of determining whether a United States citizen is also a 
resident of the

[[Page 537]]

United States. (This determination may be relevant, for example, to the 
application of section 861(a)(1) which treats income from interest-
bearing obligations of residents as income from sources within the 
United States.) The regulations do not apply and Secs. 1.871-2 and 
1.871-5 of this chapter continue to apply for purposes of the bona fide 
residence test of section 911. See Sec. 1.911-2(c) of this chapter. For 
purposes of determining whether an individual is a resident of the 
United States for estate and gift tax purposes, see Sec. 20.0-1(b)(1) 
and (2) and Sec. 25.2501-1(b) of this chapter, respectively.
    (b) Lawful permanent resident--(1) Green card test. An alien is a 
resident alien with respect to a calendar year if the individual is a 
lawful permanent resident at any time during the calendar year. A lawful 
permanent resident is an individual who has been lawfully granted the 
privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant 
in accordance with the immigration laws. Resident status is deemed to 
continue unless it is rescinded or administratively or judicially 
determined to have been abandoned.
    (2) Rescission of resident status. Resident status is considered to 
be rescinded if a final administrative or judicial order of exclusion or 
deportation is issued regarding the alien individual. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the term ``final judicial order'' means an order that is 
no longer subject to appeal to a higher court of competent jurisdiction.
    (3) Administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of 
resident status. An administrative or judicial determination of 
abandonment of resident status may be initiated by the alien individual, 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), or a consular officer. 
If the alien initiates this determination, resident status is considered 
to be abandoned when the individual's application for abandonment (INS 
Form I-407) or a letter stating the alien's intent to abandon his or her 
resident status, with the Alien Registration Receipt Card (INS Form I-
151 or Form I-551) enclosed, is filed with the INS or a consular 
officer. If INS replaces any of the form numbers referred to in this 
paragraph or Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(f), refer to the comparable INS 
replacement form number. For purposes of this paragraph, an alien 
individual shall be considered to have filed a letter stating the intent 
to abandon resident status with the INS or a consular office if such 
letter is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested (or a foreign 
country's equivalent thereof). A copy of the letter, along with proof 
that the letter was mailed and received, should be retained by the alien 
individual. If the INS or a consular officer initiates this 
determination, resident status will be considered to be abandoned upon 
the issuance of a final administrative order of abandonment. If an 
individual is granted an appeal to a federal court of competent 
jurisdiction, a final judicial order is required.
    (c) Substantial presence test--(1) In general. An alien individual 
is a resident alien if the individual meets the substantial presence 
test. An individual satisfies this test if he or she has been present in 
the United States on at least 183 days during a three year period that 
includes the current year. For purposes of this test, each day of 
presence in the current year is counted as a full day. Each day of 
presence in the first preceding year is counted as one-third of a day 
and each day of presence in the second preceding year is counted as one-
sixth of a day. For purposes of this paragraph, any fractional days 
resulting from the above calculations will not be rounded to the nearest 
whole number. (See Sec. 301.7701(b)-9(b)(2) for transitional rules for 
calendar years 1985 and 1986.)
    (2) Determination of presence--(i) Physical presence. For purposes 
of the substantial presence test, an individual shall be treated as 
present in the United States on any day that he or she is physically 
present in the United States at any time during the day. (But see 
Sec. 301.7701(b)-3 relating to days of presence that may be excluded.)
    (ii) United States. For purposes of section 7701(b) and the 
regulations thereunder, the term United States when used in a 
geographical sense includes

[[Page 538]]

the states and the District of Columbia. It also includes the 
territorial waters of the United States and the seabed and subsoil of 
those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial waters of 
the United States and over which the United States has exclusive rights, 
in accordance with international law, with respect to the exploration 
and exploitation of natural resources. It does not include the 
possessions and territories of the United States or the air space over 
the United States.
    (3) Current year. The term current year means any calendar year for 
which an alien individual is determining his or her resident status.
    (4) Thirty-one day minimum. If an individual is not physically 
present for more than 30 days during the current year, the substantial 
presence test will not be applied for that year even if the three-year 
total is 183 or more days. For purposes of the substantial presence 
test, it is irrelevant that an individual was not present for more than 
30 days in the first or second year preceding the current year.
    (d) Application of section 7701(b) to the possessions and 
territories--(1) Application to aliens. Section 7701(b) provides the 
basis for determining whether an alien individual is a resident of a 
United States possession or territory that administers income tax laws 
that are identical (except for the substitution of the name of the 
possession or territory for the term ``United States'' where 
appropriate) to those in force in the United States. If, after the 
application of section 7701(b) and the regulations thereunder, an alien 
individual is a resident of the United States and a resident of a United 
States possession or territory, the principles of Sec. 301.7701(b)-2 (d) 
(relating to significant contacts maintained by an individual with a 
foreign country) shall be applied in order to establish that the 
individual is a resident alien of either the United States or a United 
States possession or territory, but not both. See Sec. 1.933-1 (a) of 
this chapter for determining whether an individual (including a U.S. 
citizen or national) is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico. See section 
931 and the regulations thereunder for the determination of whether an 
individual (including a U.S. citizen or national) is a bona fide 
resident of American Samoa.
    (2) Non-application to citizens. Section 7701(b) does not provide 
the basis for determining whether a United States citizen or national is 
a bona fide resident of a United States possession or territory. For 
example, a United States citizen who is present in a United States 
possession or territory for 183 days during a calendar year will not 
automatically be a ``bona fide resident'' of that possession or 
territory. Whether a United States citizen or national is a bona fide 
resident of a possession or territory is determined under sections 931 
through 933 and Sec. 1.935-1 to the extent it remains effective after 
December 31, 1984.
    (e) Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. B, an alien individual, is present in the United States 
for 122 days in the current year. He was present in the United States 
for 122 days in the first preceding calendar year and for 122 days in 
the second preceding calendar year. In determining his status for the 
current year, B counts all 122 days in the United States in the current 
year plus \1/3\ of the 122 days in the United States in the first 
preceding calendar year (40\2/3\ days) and \1/6\ of the 122 days in the 
United States during the second preceding calendar year (20\1/3\ days). 
The total of 122+40\2/3\+20\1/3\ equals 183 days. B meets the 
substantial presence test and is a resident alien for the current year.
    Example 2. C, an alien individual, is present in the United States 
for 25 days during the current year. She was present in the United 
States for 365 days during the first preceding year and 365 days during 
the second preceding year. The substantial presence test does not apply 
because C is present in the United States for fewer than 31 days during 
the current year.
    Example 3. D, an alien individual, is present in the United States 
for 170 days during the current year. He was present in the United 
States for 30 days during the first preceding year and 30 days during 
the second preceding year. In determining his status for the current 
year, D counts all 170 days in the United States in the current year 
plus \1/3\ of the 30 days in the United States in the first preceding 
calendar year (10 days) and \1/6\ of the 30 days in the United States 
during the second preceding calendar year (5 days). The total of 
170+10+5 equals 185 days. D meets the substantial presence test and is a 
resident alien for the current year notwithstanding the fact that he was 
present in the United States

[[Page 539]]

for fewer than 31 days in each of the two preceding years.

[T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15242, Apr. 27, 1992; 57 FR 28612, June 26, 1992; 57 
FR 37190, Aug. 18, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(b)-2  Closer connection exception.

    (a) In general. An alien individual who meets the substantial 
presence test may nevertheless be considered a nonresident alien for the 
current year if the following conditions are satisfied--
    (1) The individual is present in the United States for fewer than 
183 days in the current year;
    (2) The individual maintains a tax home in a foreign country during 
the current year; and
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
individual has a closer connection during the current year to a single 
foreign country in which he or she maintains a tax home than to the 
United States.
    (b) Foreign country. For purposes of section 7701(b) and the 
regulations thereunder, the term ``foreign country'' when used in a 
geographical sense includes any territory under the sovereignty of the 
United Nations or a government other than that of the United States. It 
includes the territorial waters of the foreign country (determined in 
accordance with the laws of the United States), and the seabed and 
subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial 
waters of the foreign country and over which the foreign country has 
exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to 
the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. It also includes 
the possessions and territories of the United States.
    (c) Tax home--(1) Definition. For purposes of section 7701 (b) and 
the regulations under that section, the term ``tax home'' has the same 
meaning that it has for purposes of section 162(a)(2) (relating to 
travel expenses while away from home). Thus, an individual's tax home is 
considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if 
more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no 
regular or principal place of business because of the nature of the 
business, or because the individual is not engaged in carrying on any 
trade or business within the meaning of section 162(a), then the 
individual's tax home is the individual's regular place of abode in a 
real and substantial sense.
    (2) Duration and nature of tax home. The tax home maintained by the 
alien individual must be in existence for the entire current year. The 
tax home must be located in the same foreign country for which the 
individual is claiming to have the closer connection described in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Closer connection to a foreign country--(1) In general. For 
purposes of section 7701(b) and the regulations under that section, an 
alien individual will be considered to have a closer connection to a 
foreign country than the United States if the individual or the 
Commissioner establishes that the individual has maintained more 
significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United 
States. In determining whether an individual has maintained more 
significant contacts with a foreign country than the United States, the 
facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited 
to, the following--
    (i) The location of the individual's permanent home;
    (ii) The location of the individual's family;
    (iii) The location of personal belongings, such as automobiles, 
furniture, clothing and jewelry owned by the individual and his or her 
family;
    (iv) The location of social, political, cultural or religious 
organizations with which the individual has a current relationship;
    (v) The location where the individual conducts his or her routine 
personal banking activities;
    (vi) The location where the individual conducts business activities 
(other than those that constitute the individual's tax home);
    (vii) The location of the jurisdiction in which the individual holds 
a driver's license;
    (viii) The location of the jurisdiction in which the individual 
votes;
    (ix) The country of residence designated by the individual on forms 
and documents; and

[[Page 540]]

    (x) The types of official forms and documents filed by the 
individual, such as Form 1078 (Certificate of Alien Claiming Residence 
in the United States), Form W-8 (Certificate of Foreign Status) or Form 
W-9 (Payer's Request for Taxpayer ldentification Number).
    (2) Permanent home. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section, it is immaterial whether a permanent home is a house, an 
apartment, or a furnished room. It is also immaterial whether the home 
is owned or rented by the alien individual. It is material, however, 
that the dwelling be available at all times, continuously, and not 
solely for stays of short duration.
    (e) Special Rule. An alien individual may demonstrate in one year 
that he or she has a closer connection to two foreign countries (but no 
more than two) if he or she satisfies all of the following conditions--
    (1) The individual maintains a tax home beginning on the first day 
of the current year in one foreign country;
    (2) The individual changes his or her tax home during the current 
year to a second foreign country;
    (3) The individual continues to maintain his or her tax home in the 
second foreign country for the remainder of the current year;
    (4) The individual has a closer connection to each foreign country 
than to the United States for the period during which the individual 
maintains a tax home in that foreign country; and
    (5) The individual is subject to taxation as a resident pursuant to 
the internal laws of either foreign country for the entire year or 
subject to taxation as a resident in both foreign countries for the 
period during which the individual maintains a tax home in each foreign 
country.
    (f) Closer connection exception unavailable. An alien individual who 
has personally applied, or taken other affirmative steps, to change his 
or her status to that of a permanent resident during the current year or 
has an application pending for adjustment of status during the current 
year will not be eligible for the closer connection exception. 
Affirmative steps to change status to that of a permanent resident 
include, but are not limited to, the following--
    (1) The filing of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-508 (Waiver 
of Immunities) by the alien;
    (2) The filing of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-485 
(Application for Status as Permanent Resident) by the alien;
    (3) The filing of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-130

Sec. 301.7701(b)-3  Days of presence in the United States that are excluded for purposes of section 7701(b).

    (a) In general. In computing days of presence in the United States, 
an alien is considered to be present if the individual is physically 
present in the United States at any time during the day (see 
Sec. 301.7701(b)-1(c)(2)(i)). However, for purposes of section 7701(b) 
and the regulations under that section, the following days shall be 
excluded and will not count as days of presence in the United States--
    (1) Any day that an individual is present in the United States as an 
exempt individual;
    (2) Any day that an individual is prevented from leaving the United 
States because of a medical condition that arose while the individual 
was present in the United States;
    (3) Any day that an individual is in transit between two points 
outside the United States; and
    (4) Any day on which a regular commuter residing in Canada or Mexico

[[Page 541]]

commutes to and from employment in the United States.
    (b) Exempt individuals--(1) In general. An exempt individual is an 
individual who is either a--
    (i) Foreign government-related individual as defined in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section;
    (ii) Teacher or trainee as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section;
    (iii) Student as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or
    (iv) Professional athlete as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section.
    (2) Foreign government-related individual--(i) In general. A foreign 
government-related individual is an individual (and that individual's 
immediate family) who is temporarily present in the United States--
    (A) As a full-time employee of an international organization;
    (B) By reason of diplomatic status; or
    (C) By reason of a visa that the Secretary of the Treasury or his or 
her delegate (after consultation with the Secretary of State when 
appropriate) determines represents full-time diplomatic or consular 
status. An individual described in this paragraph shall be considered to 
be temporarily present in the United States if the individual is not a 
lawful permanent resident as described in Sec. 301.7701(b)-1(b)(1), 
regardless of the actual amount of time that the individual is present 
in the United States.
    (ii) Definition of international organization. The term 
``international organization'' means any public international 
organization that has been designated by the President by Executive 
Order as being entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and 
immunities provided for in the International Organizations Act (22 
U.S.C. 288). An individual described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section will be a full-time employee of an international organization if 
that individual's employment with the organization is consistent with an 
employment schedule of a person with a standard full-time work schedule 
with the organization.
    (iii) Full-time diplomatic or consular status. An individual is 
considered to have full-time diplomatic or consular status if--
    (A) The individual has been accredited by a foreign government 
recognized de jure or de facto by the United States;
    (B) The individual intends to engage primarily in official 
activities for that foreign government while in the United States; and
    (C) The individual has been recognized by the President, or by the 
Secretary of State, or by a consular officer acting on behalf of the 
Secretary of State, as being entitled to such status.
    (3) Teacher or trainee. A teacher or trainee includes any individual 
(and that individual's immediate family), other than a student, who is 
admitted temporarily to the United States as a nonimmigrant under 
section 101(a)(15) (relating to the admission of teachers and trainees 
into the United States) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(15)(J)) and who substantially complies with the requirements of 
being admitted.
    (4) Student. A student is any individual (and that individual's 
immediate family) who is admitted temporarily to the United States as a 
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F) or (M) (relating to the 
admission of students into the United States) or section 101(a)(15)(J) 
(relating to the admission of teachers and trainees into the United 
States) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(F), 
(J), (M)) who substantially complies with the requirements of being 
admitted. For rules concerning taxation of certain nonresident students 
or trainees, see section 871(c) and Sec. 1.871-9(a) of this chapter.
    (5) Professional athlete. A professional athlete is an individual 
who is temporarily present in the United States to compete in a 
charitable sports event described in section 274(l)(1)(B). For purposes 
of computing the days of presence in the United States, only days on 
which the athlete actually competes in a charitable sports event 
described in section 274(l)(1)(B) shall be excluded. Thus, days on which 
the individual is present to practice for the event, to perform 
promotional or other activities related to the event, or to travel 
between events shall be included for purposes of the substantial 
presence test.

[[Page 542]]

    (6) Substantial compliance. An individual described in paragraph (b) 
(3) or (4) of this section will be deemed to comply substantially with 
the visa requirements relevant to residence for tax purposes if the 
individual has not engaged in activities that are prohibited by the 
Immigration and Nationality Act and the regulations thereunder and could 
result in the loss of F, J or M visa status. An individual will not be 
deemed to comply substantially with the visa requirements relevant to 
residence for tax purposes merely by showing that the individual's visa 
has not been revoked. An independent determination of substantial 
compliance may be made by the Internal Revenue Service for any 
individual claiming to be an exempt individual under paragraph (b) (3) 
or (4) of this section. For example, if an individual with an F visa 
(student visa) is found to have accepted unauthorized employment or to 
have maintained a course of study that is not considered by the Internal 
Revenue Service to be full-time, the individual will not be considered 
to comply substantially with the individual's visa requirements 
regardless of whether the individual's visa has been revoked.
    (7) Limitation on teacher or trainee and student exemptions--(i) 
Teacher or trainee limitation in general. Except as otherwise provided, 
an individual shall not exclude days of presence as a teacher or trainee 
if the individual has been exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for 
any part of two of the six preceding calendar years.
    (ii) Special teacher or trainee limitation for section 872(b)(3) 
compensation. If--
    (A) A teacher or trainee receives compensation in the current year 
and all of that compensation is described in section 872(b)(3);
    (B) That individual was present in the United States as a teacher or 
trainee in any prior year within the last 6 years; and
    (C) During each prior year (within the 6 year period) in which the 
individual was present as a teacher or trainee, the individual received 
compensation all of which was described in section 872(b)(3);

Then that individual shall include days of presence as a teacher or 
trainee in the current year only if the individual has been exempt as a 
teacher, trainee, or student for any part of four of the six preceding 
calendar years.
    (iii) Limitation on student exemption. An individual will not be 
able to exclude days of presence as a student if the individual has been 
exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of more than five 
calendar years, unless it is established to the satisfaction of the 
district director that the individual does not intend to reside 
permanently in the United States and has substantially complied with the 
requirements of the student visa providing for the individual's 
temporary presence in the United States. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b)(7), the facts and circumstances to be considered in determining if 
an individual has demonstrated an intent to reside permanently in the 
United States include (but are not limited to)--
    (A) Whether the individual has maintained a closer connection with a 
foreign country as described in Sec. 301.7701(b)-2; and
    (B) Whether the individual has taken affirmative steps within the 
meaning of paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.7701(b)-2 to adjust the 
individual's status from nonimmigrant to lawful permanent resident.
    (iv) Transition rule. The rules in this paragraph (b)(7) relating to 
stated periods of exempt status apply only for those stated periods that 
occur after 1984. Thus, for example, an alien who is present as a 
student during the calendar years 1982-1990 will not be subject to the 
five year rule for students until 1990.
    (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
paragraphs (b)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section:

    Example 1. B is temporarily present in the United States during the 
current year as a teacher, within the meaning of section 101(a)(15)(J) 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act. B does not receive compensation 
described in section 872(b)(3) in the current year. B has been treated 
as an exempt student for the past three years. Although this is the 
first year that B is seeking to be exempt as a teacher, he will not be 
considered an exempt individual for the year because he has been exempt 
as a student for at least two of the past six years.
    Example 2. C is temporarily present in the United States during the 
current year as a

[[Page 543]]

teacher and receives compensation described in section 872(b)(3) in the 
current year. C has been treated as an exempt teacher for the past two 
years but C's compensation for those years was not described in section 
872(b)(3). C will not be considered an exempt individual for the current 
year because she has been exempt as a teacher for at least two of the 
past six years.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that all 
of C's compensation for the two preceding years was described in section 
872(b)(3). C will be considered to be an exempt individual for the 
current year because she has not been exempt as a student, teacher or 
trainee for four of the six preceding calendar years.
    Example 4. D is temporarily present in the United States during the 
current year as a teacher, within the meaning of section 101(a)(15)(J) 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act. D does not receive compensation 
described in section 872(b)(3) in the current year. D entered the United 
States in December of the second preceding year and intends to remain in 
the United States until June of the current year. D will not be 
considered an exempt individual for the current year because he has been 
exempt as a teacher for at least two of the past six years.

    (8) Immediate family. The immediate family of an exempt individual 
includes the individual's spouse and unmarried children (whether by 
blood or adoption) but only if the spouse's or unmarried children's visa 
status are derived from and dependent on the visa classification of the 
exempt individual. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term 
unmarried children means those children who are under 21 years of age, 
who reside regularly in the household of the exempt individual, and who 
are not members of some other household. The immediate family of an 
exempt individual does not include the attendants, servants, and 
personal employees of that individual.
    (c) Medical condition--(1) In general. An individual will not be 
considered present on any day that the individual intends to leave and 
is unable to leave the United States because of a medical condition or 
medical problem that arose while the individual was present in the 
United States. A day of presence will not be excluded if the individual, 
who was initially prevented from leaving, is subsequently able to leave 
the United States and then remains in the United States beyond a 
reasonable period for making arrangements to leave the United States. A 
day will also not be excluded if the medical condition arose during a 
prior stay in the United States (whether or not days of presence during 
the prior stay were excluded) and the alien returns to the United States 
for treatment of the medical condition or medical problem that arose 
during the prior stay.
    (2) Intent to leave the United States. For purposes of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, whether an individual intends to leave the 
United States on a particular day will be determined based on all the 
facts and circumstances. Thus, if at the time an individual's medical 
condition or medical problem arose, the individual was present in the 
United States for a definite purpose which by its nature could be 
accomplished within the United States during a period of time that would 
not cause the individual to be a resident under the substantial presence 
test, the individual may be able to establish that he or she intended to 
leave the United States. However, if the individual's purpose is of such 
a nature that an extended period of time would be required for its 
accomplishment (sufficient to cause the individual to be a resident 
under the substanial presence test), the individual would not be able to 
establish the requisite intent to leave the United States. If the 
individual is present in the United States for no particular purpose or 
a purpose by its nature that does not require a specific period of time 
to accomplish, the determination of whether the individual has the 
requisite intent to leave the United States will depend on all the 
surrounding facts and circumstances. In the case of an individual 
adjudicated mentally incompetent, proof of intent to leave the United 
States may be determined by analyzing the incompetent's pattern of 
behavior prior to the adjudication of incompetence. Generally, an 
individual will be presumed to have intended to leave during a period of 
illness if the individual leaves the United States within a reasonable 
period of time (time to make arrangements to leave) after becoming 
physically able to leave.
    (3) Pre-existing medical condition. A medical condition or problem 
will not

[[Page 544]]

be considered to arise while the individual is present in the United 
States, if the condition or problem existed prior to the individual's 
arrival in the United States, and the individual was aware of the 
condition or problem, regardless of whether the individual required 
treatment for the condition or problem when the individual entered the 
United States.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this paragraph (c):

    Example 1. B is in a serious automobile accident in the United 
States on March 25. B intended to leave the United States on March 31 
(as evidenced by an airline ticket), but was unable to leave on that 
date as a result of the injuries suffered in the accident. B recovered 
from the injuries and was able to leave and did leave the United States 
on May 31. B's presence in the United States during the period from 
April 1 through May 31 will not be counted as days of presence in the 
United States.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B's 
return flight (as evidenced by an airline ticket) was scheduled for May 
31. Because B did not intend to leave the United States until May 31, B 
may not exclude any days of presence in the United States.

    (d) Days in transit. An alien individual may exclude days of 
presence in the United States if the individual is in transit between 
two foreign points, and is physically present in the United States for 
fewer than 24 hours. For purposes of this paragraph, an individual will 
be considered to be in transit if the individual pursues activities that 
are substantially related to completing his or her travel to a foreign 
point of destination. For example, an alien who travels between airports 
in the United States in order to change planes en route to the 
individual's destination will be considered to be in transit. However, 
if the individual attends a business meeting while he or she is present 
in the United States, whether or not that meeting is within the confines 
of the airport, the individual will not be considered to be in transit. 
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``foreign point'' means any 
areas that are not included within the definition of the term ``United 
States'' provided in Sec. 301.7701(b)-1(c)(2)(ii).
    (e) Regular commuters from Mexico or Canada--(1) General rule. An 
alien individual will not be considered to be present in the United 
States on days that the individual commutes to the United States from 
the individual's residence in Mexico or Canada if the individual 
regularly commutes from Mexico or Canada. An alien individual will be 
considered to commute regularly if the individual commutes to the 
individual's location of employment or self-employment in the United 
States from his or her residence in Mexico or Canada on more than 75% of 
the workdays during the working period.
    (2) Definitions. (i) The term commutes means to travel to employment 
or self-employment and to return to one's residence within a 24-hour 
period.
    (ii) The term workdays means days on which the individual works in 
the United States or Canada or Mexico.
    (iii) The term working period means the period beginning with the 
first day in the current year on which the individual is physically 
present in the United States for purposes of engaging in employment or 
self-employment and ending on the last day in the current year on which 
the individual is physically present in the United States for purposes 
of engaging in that employment or self-employment. If the nature of the 
employment or self-employment is such that it requires the individual to 
be present in the United States only on a seasonal or cyclical basis, 
the working period will begin with the first day of the season or cycle 
on which the individual is present in the United States for purposes of 
engaging in that employment or self-employment and end on the last day 
of the season or cycle on which the individual is present in the United 
States for the purpose of engaging in that employment or self-
employment. Thus, there may be more than one working period in a 
calendar year and a working period may begin in one calendar year and 
end in the following calendar year.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of 
this paragraph (e):

    Example 1. B lives in Mexico and is employed by Corporation X in its 
office in Mexico. B was temporarily assigned to X's office in the United 
States. B's employment in the

[[Page 545]]

United States office began on February 1, 1988, and continued through 
June 1, 1988. On June 2, B resumed his employment in Mexico. On 59 days 
in the period beginning on February 1, 1988, and ending on June 1, 1988, 
B travelled each morning from his residence in Mexico to X Corporation's 
United States office for the purpose of engaging in his employment with 
X Corporation. B returned to his residence in Mexico on each of those 
evenings. On seven days in the period from February 1, 1988, through 
June 1, 1988, B worked in X's Mexico office. B is not considered to have 
been present in the United States on any of the days that he travelled 
to X's United States office for the purpose of engaging in employment 
with Corporation X because he commuted to his place of employment within 
the United States on more than 75% of the workdays during the working 
period (59 workdays in the United States/66 workdays in the working 
period=89.4%).
    Example 2. C, who lives in Canada, contracted with a resort located 
in the United States to provide snow-skiing instructions for the 
resort's customers for two skiing seasons, the first beginning on 
November 15, 1987, and ending on March 15, 1988, and the second 
beginning on November 15, 1988, and ending on March 15, 1989. On 90 days 
in each of the two skiing seasons, C travelled in the morning from 
Canada to the resort to provide skiing instructions pursuant to the 
contract. C returned to Canada on each of those evenings. On 20 days 
during each of the two skiing seasons, C worked in Canada. C is not 
considered to have been present in the United States on any of the days 
that she travelled to the United States to provide ski instructions in 
either the first working period beginning on November 15, 1987, and 
ending on March 15, 1988, or the second working period beginning on 
November 15, 1988, and ending on March 15, 1989, because she commuted to 
her employment within the United States on more than 75% of the workdays 
during each of the working periods (90 workdays in the United States/110 
workdays in the working period=81.8%).
    Example 3. D, who lives in Canada, is the sole proprietor of a 
wholesale lumber business with offices in both the United States and 
Canada. Beginning on January 4, 1988, and ending on February 12, 1988, D 
commuted to work in his United States office on 30 days. Beginning on 
February 15, 1988, and ending on March 25, 1988, D commuted to work in 
his Canadian office on 30 days. Beginning on March 28, 1988, and ending 
on May 27, 1988, D commuted to work in his United States office on 45 
days. Subsequent to May 27, D did not commute to the United States on 
any other days in 1988. D is considered to have been present in the 
United States on each day that he travelled to his office in the United 
States because D did not commute to the United States office on more 
than 75% of the workdays during the working period beginning on January 
4, 1988, and ending on May 27, 1988 (75 workdays in the United States/
105 workdays in the working period=71.4%).

    (f) Determination of excluded days applies beyond year of 
determination. If a day of presence is excluded under this section, then 
that day shall not be taken into account in the current year or the 
first or second preceding year.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(b)-4  Residency time periods.

    (a) First year of residency. An alien individual who was not a 
United States resident during the preceding calendar year and who is a 
United States resident for the current year will begin to be a resident 
for tax purposes on the alien's residency starting date. The residency 
starting date for an alien who meets the substantial presence test is 
the first day during the calendar year on which the individual is 
present in the United States. The residency starting date for an alien 
who meets the lawful permanent resident test (green card test), 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 301.7701(b)-1, is the first day 
during the calendar year in which the individual is physically present 
in the United States as a lawful permanent resident. The residency 
starting date for an alien who satisfies both the substantial presence 
test and the green card test will be the earlier of the first day the 
individual is physically present in the United States as a lawful 
permanent resident of the United States or the first day during the year 
that the individual is present for purposes of the substantial presence 
test. (See Sec. 301.7701(b)-9(b)(1) for the transitional rule relating 
to the residency starting date of an alien individual who was a lawful 
permanent resident in 1984. See also Sec. 301.7701(b)-3 for days that 
may be excluded.)
    (b) Last year of residency--(1) General rule. An alien individual 
who is a United States resident during the current year but who is not a 
United States resident at any time during the following calendar year 
will cease to be a resident for tax purposes on the individual's 
residency termination date. Generally, the residency termination

[[Page 546]]

date will be the last day of the calendar year.
    (2) Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the residency termination date for an alien individual who meets the 
substantial presence test is the last day during the calendar year that 
the individual is physically present in the United States if the 
individual establishes that, for the remainder of the calendar year, the 
individual's tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained 
a closer connection (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(d)) to 
that foreign country than to the United States. Similarly, the residency 
termination date for an alien who meets the green card test is the first 
day during the calendar year that the alien is no longer a lawful 
permanent resident if the individual establishes that, for the remainder 
of the calendar year, his or her tax home was in a foreign country and 
he or she maintained a closer connection to that foreign country than to 
the United States. The residency termination date for an alien who 
satisfies both the substantial presence test and the green card test for 
the current year, will be the later of the first day the individual is 
no longer a lawful permanent resident of the United States or the last 
day the individual was physically present in the United States if the 
alien establishes that, for the remainder of the calendar year, his or 
her tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained a closer 
connection to that foreign country than to the United States. It is 
immaterial whether the individual's tax home was in the United States, 
or that the individual had a closer connection to the United States than 
to the foreign country, prior to the date of his or her departure from 
the United States or the date on which the individual was no longer a 
lawful permanent resident, whichever is applicable.
    (c) Rules relating to residency starting date and residency 
termination date--(1) De minimis presence. An alien individual may be 
present in the United States for up to 10 days without triggering the 
residency starting date (for purposes of the substantial presence test) 
or extending the residency termination date (for purposes of the 
substantial presence test) if the individual is able to establish that, 
during that period, the individual's tax home was in a foreign country 
and he or she maintained a closer connection to that foreign country 
than to the United States. Days from more than one period of presence 
may be disregarded for purposes of determining an individual's residency 
starting date or termination date so long as the total is not more than 
10 days. However, an individual may not disregard any days that occur in 
a period of consecutive days of presence, if all the days that occur 
during that period cannot be excluded. An individual must include days 
of presence for purposes of determining whether the individual meets the 
substantial presence test even though the days may be disregarded for 
purposes of determining the individual's residency starting date or 
residency termination date.
    (2) Proration. If an individual's residency starting date does not 
fall on the first day of the tax year, or the individual's residency 
termination date does not fall on the last day of the tax year, the 
individual's income tax liability should be calculated in accordance 
with Sec. 1.871-13 of this chapter dealing with the taxation of 
individuals who change residence status during the taxable year.
    (3) Residency starting date for certain individuals--(i) In general. 
If an alien individual (who otherwise does not meet the substantial 
presence test or the green card test for the current year) is physically 
present in the United States for at least 31 consecutive days during the 
current year, and also for a period of continuous presence beginning 
with the first day of that thirty-one day period (see paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section), then the individual may elect to be 
treated as a resident during the current year. The individual's 
residency starting date shall be the first day of that thirty-one day 
period, if--
    (A) The individual was not a resident of the United States under the 
substantial presence test or the green card test in the year preceding 
the current year; and
    (B) The individual is a resident of the United States in the 
subsequent year under the substantial presence test (whether or not the 
individual is also a

[[Page 547]]

resident of the United States under the green card test).
    (ii) Determination of presence. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, an individual shall be treated as 
present in the United States on any day that the individual is 
physically present in the United States at any time during the day.
    (iii) Thirty-one day period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), 
the term thirty-one day period means any period of 31 consecutive days 
during which an individual is physically present in the United States 
during each day of the period.
    (iv) Period of continuous presence. For purposes of this paragraph 
(c)(3), the term continuous presence means a period of presence in the 
United States that includes 75 percent of the days in the current year 
beginning with (and including) the first day of the individual's thirty-
one day period of presence. Only for purposes of the continuous presence 
requirement, an individual will be deemed to be present in the United 
States for up to 5 days on which the individual is absent from the 
United States. These days will not be deemed to be days of presence for 
purposes of the thirty-one day period of presence requirement. If an 
individual is present for more than one thirty-one day period of 
presence and satisfies the continuous presence requirement with regard 
to each period, the individual's residency starting date shall be the 
first day of the first thirty-one day period of presence. If an 
individual is present for more than one thirty-one day period of 
presence but satisfies the continuous presence requirement only for a 
later thirty-one day period, the individual's residency starting date 
shall be the first day of the later thirty-one day period of presence. 
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), days of presence that are 
otherwise excluded under section 7701(b)(3)(D)(i) and Sec. 301.7701(b)-
3(a)(1) (exempt individual), (a)(2) (medical condition), (a)(3) (in 
transit between two foreign points), and (a)(4) (regular commuter) shall 
not be counted as days of presence for purposes of either the thirty-one 
day period or continuous presence requirement.
    (v) Election procedure--(A) Filing requirements. An alien individual 
shall make an election to be treated as a resident under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section by attaching a statement (described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(v)(C) of this section) to the individual's income tax return 
(Form 1040) for the taxable year for which the election is to be in 
effect (the election year). The alien individual may not make this 
election until such time as he has satisfied the substantial presence 
test for the year following the election year. If an alien individual 
has not satisfied the substantial presence test for the year following 
the election year as of the due date (not including extensions) of the 
tax return for the election year, the alien individual may request an 
extension of time for filing the return until a reasonable period after 
he or she has satisfied such test, provided that the individual pays 
with his or her extension application the amount of tax he or she 
expects to owe for the election year computed as if he or she were a 
nonresident alien throughout the election year. An election made under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section may not be revoked without the approval 
of the Commissioner or his delegate.
    (B) Election on behalf of a dependent child. An individual may make 
an election on behalf of a dependent child (as defined in paragraphs (1) 
and (2) of section 152(a), without regard to section 152(b)(3)) if the 
individual is qualified to make an election on his or her own behalf, 
the child qualifies to make an election under this paragraph (c)(3), and 
the child is not required by section 6012 to file a United States income 
tax return for the year for which the election is to be effective.
    (C) Statement. The statement required by paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of 
this section shall include the name and address of the alien individual 
and contain a signed declaration that the election is being made. If the 
individual is also making an election on behalf of any dependent 
children, then the statement must include the required information with 
respect to those children. The statement must specify--
    (1) That the alien individual was not a resident in the year 
immediately preceding the election year;

[[Page 548]]

    (2) That the alien individual is a resident under the substantial 
presence test in the year following the election year;
    (3) The individual's number of days of presence in the United States 
during the year following the election year;
    (4) The date or dates of the alien individual's thirty-one day 
period of presence and period of continuous presence in the United 
States during the election year; and
    (5) The date or dates of absence from the United States during the 
election year that are deemed to be days of presence.
    (vi) Penalty for failure to comply with filing requirements--(A) 
General rule. If an individual fails to comply with the election 
procedure of paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section, the individual must 
file his or her income tax return for the current year as a nonresident 
alien.
    (B) Exception. The penalty described in paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(A) of 
this section shall not apply if the individual can show by clear and 
convincing evidence that he or she took reasonable actions to become 
aware of the filing requirements and significant affirmative steps to 
comply with the requirements. An individual who requests an extension of 
time to file his or her income tax return pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(3)(v) of this section will be considered to have taken significant 
affirmative steps to comply with the requirement that the individual pay 
his or her tax determined as if the individual were a nonresident alien 
if the individual paid with his or her extension application at least 90 
percent of the amount of the tax the individual actually owed for the 
election year computed as if he or she were a nonresident alien 
throughout the election year.
    (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of 
this section:

    Example 1. B, a citizen of foreign country X, is an alien who has 
never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. B comes to 
the United States on January 6, 1985, to attend a business meeting and 
returns to country X on January 10, 1985. B is able to establish a 
closer connection to country X for the period January 6-10. On March 1, 
1985, B moves to the United States and resides here until August 20, 
1985, when he returns to country X. On December 12, 1985, B comes to the 
United States for pleasure and stays here until December 16, 1985 when 
he returns to country X. B is able to establish a closer connection to 
country X for the period December 12-16. B is not a United States 
resident for tax purposes during the following year and can establish a 
closer connection to country X for the remainder of calendar year 1985. 
B is a resident of the United States under the substantial presence test 
because B is present in the United States for 183 days (5 days in 
January plus 173 days for the period March 1-August 20 plus 5 days in 
December). B's residency starting date is March 1, 1985, and his 
residency termination date is August 20, 1985.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B 
remains in the United States until December 17, 1985, and is able to 
establish a closer connection to country X for the period December 18 
through 31. B's residency termination date is December 17, 1985.
    Example 3. C, a citizen of foreign country Y, is an alien who has 
never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. C comes to 
the United States for the first time on February 10, 1985, and attends a 
business conference until February 24, 1985, when she returns to country 
Y. On April 20, 1985, C enters the United States as a lawful permanent 
resident. On November 10, 1985, C ceases to be a lawful permanent 
resident but stays on in the United States until November 20, 1985 when 
she returns to country Y. On December 8, 1985, C comes to the United 
States and stays here until December 17, 1985 when she returns to 
country Y. She can establish a closer connection to country Y for that 
period. C is not a resident of the United States during the following 
calendar year and can establish a closer connection to country Y for the 
remainder of calendar year 1985. C qualifies as a United States resident 
under both the green card test and the substantial presence test. C's 
residency starting date under the green card test is April 20, 1985. 
Under the substantial presence test, C's residency starting date is 
February 10, 1985, because she is present for more than ten days in 
February and cannot take advantage of the de minimis presence rule. 
Therefore, C's residency starting date is February 10, 1985. C's 
residency termination date under the green card test is November 10, 
1985. Her residency termination date under the substantial presence test 
is November 20, because B can disregard ten days of presence in 
December. Thus, her residency termination date is November 20, 1985, the 
later of her residency termination date under the substantial presence 
test or the green card test.
    Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that C is 
initially present in the United States on business from February 5 to 
February 9, 1985. C is able to establish a

[[Page 549]]

closer connection to country Y for that period. C may take advantage of 
only ten days of de minimis presence and may exclude days from a 
continuous period of presence only if she can exclude all the days that 
occur during that period. Thus, C may choose either of the following 
periods of residency: residency starting date February 5, 1985, and 
residency termination date November 20, 1985, or residency starting date 
April 20, 1985, and residency termination date December 17, 1985.
    Example 5. D, a citizen of foreign country Z, is an alien who has 
never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. D comes to 
the United States on November 1, 1985 and is present in the United 
States on 31 consecutive days (from November 1 through December 1, 
1985). D returns to country Z on December 1 and does not come back to 
the United States until December 17, 1985. He remains in the United 
States for the rest of the year. During 1986, D is a resident of the 
United States under the substantial presence test. D may elect to be 
treated as a resident of the United States for 1985 because he was 
present in the United States in 1985 for a 31 consecutive day period of 
presence (November 1 through December 1, 1985) and for at least 75 
percent of the days following (and including) the first day of D's 31 
consecutive day period of presence (46 total days of presence in the 
United States/61 days in the period from November 1 through December 
31=75.4%). If D makes the election to be treated as a resident, his 
residency starting date will be November 1, 1985.
    Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that D is 
absent from the United States on December 24, 25, 29, 30 and 31. D may 
make the election to be treated as a resident for 1985 because up to 
five days of absence will be deemed to be days of presence for purposes 
of the continuous presence requirement.
    Example 7. F, a citizen of foreign country M, is an alien individual 
who has never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. F 
comes to the United States on January 1, 1985 and remains in the United 
States through January 31, 1985, when she returns to country M. F comes 
back to the United States on October 1, 1985 and is present in the 
United States through November 1, 1985. From November 1, 1985 through 
December 31, 1985, F is present in the United States for 38 days. 
Although F satisfies two 31 consecutive day periods of presence, 
(January 1 through January 31 and October 1 through November 1), she 
satisfies the continuous presence requirement only with regard to the 
later period of presence (69 total days of presence/92 days in the 
period from October 1 through December 31=75%). Thus, if F makes the 
election to be treated as a resident, his residency starting date is 
October 1, 1985.

    (e) No lapse--(1) Residency in prior year. An alien individual who 
was a United States resident during any part of the preceding calendar 
year and who is a United States resident for any part of the current 
year will be considered to be taxable as a resident at the beginning of 
the current year. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), it is 
immaterial whether an individual is considered to be a resident under 
the substantial presence test or the green card test.
    (2) Residency in following year. An alien individual who is a United 
States resident for any part of the current year and who is also a 
United States resident for any part of the following year (regardless of 
whether the individual has a closer connection to a foreign country than 
the United States during the current year) will be taxable as a resident 
through the end of the current year. For purposes of this paragraph 
(e)(2), it is immaterial whether an individual is considered to be a 
resident under the substantial presence test or the green card test.
    (3) Special rule. If an individual meets the green card test for the 
current year but is not physically present in the United States during 
the current year, then the individual's residency starting date shall be 
the first day of the following year.
    (4) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
this paragraph (e).

    Example. B, an alien individual who is a citizen of foreign country 
M, comes to the United States for the first time on May 1, 1985, and 
remains in the United States until November 5, 1985, when he returns to 
country M. B comes back to the United States on March 5, 1986 as a 
lawful permanent resident and remains in the United States until 
September 10, 1986, when he ceases to be a lawful permanent resident and 
returns to country M. B is not a resident in calendar year 1987. B's 
United States residency in calendar year 1985 continues through December 
31, 1985, because he is a United States resident in the following 
calendar year. In calendar year 1986, B's United States residency is 
deemed to begin on January 1, 1986 because B qualified as a resident in 
the preceding calendar year. Thus, B's residency period in the United 
States begins on May 1, 1985, and ends on September 10, 1986.

Sec. 301.7701(b)-5  Coordination with section 877.

    (a) General rule. An alien individual will be subject to United 
States income tax in the manner provided by section 877, regardless of 
whether the individual has a tax avoidance motive, if--
    (1) The alien individual is a resident alien of the United States 
for at least three consecutive calendar years (the initial residency 
period) beginning after December 31, 1984;
    (2) The period of residence for each of the three consecutive 
calendar years includes at least 183 days;
    (3) The alien is once again taxed as a nonresident (including an 
individual taxed as a nonresident) under Sec. 301.7701(b)-7(a)(1); and
    (4) The alien then becomes a resident of the United States before 
the close of the third calendar year beginning after the individual's 
residency termination date in the initial residency period.
    (b) Tax imposed. The tax provided for under paragraph (a) of this 
section will be imposed for the intervening period of nonresidency only 
if the amount of tax would exceed the amount of tax that would be 
imposed under section 871, relating to the taxation of nonresident 
aliens.
    (c) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
this section.

    Example. B, a citizen of foreign country F, enters the United States 
on April 1, 1985, as a lawful permanent resident. On August 1, 1987, B 
ceases to be a lawful permanent resident and returns to country F. B 
meets the initial residency period requirement because he is a resident 
of the United States for at least 183 days in each of three consecutive 
years (1985, 1986 and 1987). B returns to the United States on October 
5, 1990, as a lawful permanent resident. Because B became a resident of 
the United States before the close of the third calendar year (1990) 
beginning after the close of the initial residency period (August 1, 
1987), he is subject to tax under section 877(b) for the intervening 
period of nonresidency, August 2, 1987 through October 4, 1990, if the 
amount of the tax imposed under section 877 is more than the tax imposed 
under section 871.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(b)-6  Taxable year.

    (a) In general. An alien individual who has not established a fiscal 
year as his or her taxable year prior to the period that the individual 
is subject to United States income tax as a resident or a nonresident 
shall adopt the calendar year as his or her taxable year. An alien who 
has established a fiscal year in a foreign country prior to the period 
that the individual is subject to United States income tax may adopt the 
calendar year as his or her taxable year for United States income tax 
purposes without requesting a change in accounting period. An individual 
will be considered to have established a fiscal year (whether in the 
United States or a foreign country) if the annual accounting period on 
which the individual computes his or her income is a fiscal year, the 
individual keeps his or her books in accordance with that fiscal year, 
and the requirements of section 441 and Sec. 1.441-1(e) of this chapter 
are otherwise satisfied. An alien who has established a fiscal year and 
is a resident alien during the calendar year will be treated as a 
resident alien with respect to any portion of his or her taxable year 
(beginning with the individual's residency starting date and ending with 
the individual's residency termination date) that falls within such 
calendar year. Once the individual has established either a fiscal or 
calendar year taxable year for any period for which the individual is 
subject to United States income tax, the individual may not change that 
taxable year without the approval of the Secretary. See section 442.
    (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of 
this section:

    Example 1. B, a citizen and resident of foreign country F, was 
engaged in a United States business during 1982 and filed a return on a 
fiscal year basis. B's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. 
B comes to the United States on March 8, 1985 and remains in the United 
States until October 10, 1985, when he returns to country F. B maintains 
a closer connection to and his tax home in Country F for the remainder 
of calendar year 1985. B, who is not a United States resident at any 
time in 1986, is a United States resident for the period that begins on 
March 8, 1985, and ends on October 10, 1985. B has adopted a fiscal year 
taxable year for purposes of computing his United States income tax 
liability. For his fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1985, B will 
be taxed as a United States resident for the period that

[[Page 551]]

begins on March 8, 1985 and ends on September 30, 1985. For his fiscal 
year that ends on September 30, 1986, B will only be taxed as a United 
States resident for the period that begins on October 1, 1985 and ends 
on October 10, 1985.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B's 
1982 business was a country F business established on a fiscal year 
basis and at no time prior to 1985 was B subject to United States income 
tax. B may adopt a calendar year as his taxable year for United States 
income tax purposes without requesting a change of accounting period. B 
continues to use a fiscal year as his taxable year. For his fiscal year 
that ends on September 30, 1985, B will be taxed as a United States 
resident for the period that begins on March 8, 1985 and ends September 
30, 1985. For his fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1986, B will be 
taxed as a United States resident for the period that begins on October 
1, 1985 and ends on October 10, 1985.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B's 
1982 business was a country F business established on a fiscal year 
basis and at no time prior to 1985 was B subject to United States income 
tax. B may adopt a calendar year as his taxable year for United States 
income tax purposes without requesting a change of accounting period. B 
adopts a calendar year as his taxable year for 1985. For his calendar 
year taxable year ending on December 31, 1985, B will be taxed as a 
United States resident for the period that begins on March 8, 1985, and 
ends on October 10, 1985.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(b)-7  Coordination with income tax treaties.

    (a) Consistency requirement--(1) Application. The application of 
this section shall be limited to an alien individual who is a dual 
resident taxpayer pursuant to a provision of a treaty that provides for 
resolution of conflicting claims of residence by the United States and 
its treaty partner. A ``dual resident taxpayer'' is an individual who is 
considered a resident of the United States pursuant to the internal laws 
of the United States and also a resident of a treaty country pursuant to 
the treaty partner's internal laws. If the alien individual determines 
that he or she is a resident of the foreign country for treaty purposes, 
and the alien individual claims a treaty benefit (as a nonresident of 
the United States) so as to reduce the individual's United States income 
tax liability with respect to any item of income covered by an 
applicable tax convention during a taxable year in which the individual 
was considered a dual resident taxpayer, then that individual shall be 
treated as a nonresident alien of the United States for purposes of 
computing that individual's United States income tax liability under the 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder 
(including the withholding provisions of section 1441 and the 
regulations under that section in cases in which the dual resident 
taxpayer is the recipient of income subject to withholding) with respect 
to that portion of the taxable year the individual was considered a dual 
resident taxpayer.
    (2) Computation of tax liability. If an alien individual is a dual 
resident taxpayer, then the rules on residency provided in the 
convention shall apply for purposes of determining the individual's 
residence for all purposes of that treaty.
    (3) Other Code purposes. Generally, for purposes of the Internal 
Revenue Code other than the computation of the individual's United 
States income tax liability, the individual shall be treated as a United 
States resident. Therefore, for example, the individual shall be treated 
as a United States resident for purposes of determining whether a 
foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation under section 
957 or whether a foreign corporation is a foreign personal holding 
company under section 552. In addition, the application of paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section does not affect the determination of the 
individual's residency time periods under Sec. 301.7701(b)-4.
    (4) Special rules for S corporations. [Reserved]
    (b) Filing requirements. An alien individual described in paragraph 
(a) of this section who determines his or her U.S. tax liability as if 
he or she were a nonresident alien shall make a return on Form 1040NR on 
or before the date prescribed by law (including extensions) for making 
an income tax return as a nonresident. The individual shall prepare a 
return and compute his or her tax liability as a nonresident alien.

[[Page 552]]

The individual shall attach a statement (in the form required in 
paragraph (c) of this section) to the Form 1040NR. The Form 1040NR and 
the attached statement, shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service 
Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255. The filing of a Form 1040NR by an 
individual described in paragraph (a) of this section may affect the 
determination by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as to 
whether the individual qualifies to maintain a residency permit.
    (c) Contents of statement--(1) In general. The statement filed by an 
individual described in paragraph (a) of this section shall set forth 
the heading ``TREATY-BASED RETURN POSITION DISCLOSURE UNDER 
Sec. 301.7701(b)-7(b) AND SECTION 6114'' and indicate that the taxpayer 
is claiming a treaty benefit as a nonresident of the United States, the 
facts relied upon to support the position taken, the nature and 
approximate amount of income and the specific treaty provision for which 
the taxpayer is claiming a treaty benefit. See section 6114 and 
Sec. 301.6114-1 for rules relating to other treaty-based return 
positions taken by the same taxpayer.
    (2) Controlled foreign corporation shareholders. [Reserved]
    (3) S corporation shareholders. [Reserved]
    (d) Relationship to section 6114(a) treaty-based return positions. 
The statement required by paragraph (b) of this section will be 
considered disclosure for purposes of section 6114 and Sec. 301.6114-
1(a), but only if the statement is in the form required by paragraph (c) 
of this section. If the taxpayer fails to file the statement required by 
paragraph (b) of this section on or before the date prescribed in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the taxpayer will be subject to the 
penalties imposed by section 6712. See section 6712 and Sec. 301.6712-1.
    (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this section:

    Example 1. B, an alien individual, is a resident of foreign country 
X, under X's internal law. Country X is a party to an income tax 
convention with the United States. B is also a resident of the United 
States under the Internal Revenue Code. B is considered to be a resident 
of country X under the convention. The convention does not specifically 
deal with characterization of foreign corporations as controlled foreign 
corporations or the taxability of United States shareholders on 
inclusions of subpart F income, but it provides, in an ``Other Income'' 
article similar to Article 21 of the 1981 draft of the United States 
Model Income Tax Convention (U.S. Model), that items of income of a 
resident of country X that are not specifically dealt with in the 
convention shall be taxable only in country X. B owns 80% of the one 
class of stock of foreign corporation R. The remaining 20% is owned by 
C, a United States citizen who is unrelated to B. In 1985, corporation 
R's only income is interest that is foreign personal holding company 
income under Sec. 1.954A-2 of this chapter. Because the United States-X 
income tax convention does not deal with characterization of foreign 
corporations as controlled foreign corporations, United States internal 
income tax law applies. Therefore, B and C are United States 
shareholders within the meaning of Sec. 1.951-1(g) of this chapter, 
corporation R is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.957-1 of this chapter, and corporation R's income is included in 
C's income as subpart F income under Sec. 1.951-1 of this chapter. B may 
avoid current taxation on his share of the subpart F inclusion by filing 
as a nonresident (i.e., by following the procedure in Sec. 301.7701(b)-
7(b)).
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B 
also earns United States source dividend income. The United States-X 
income tax convention provides that the rate of United States tax on 
United States source dividends paid to residents of country X shall not 
exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. B's United 
States tax liability with respect to the dividends would be smaller if 
he were treated as a resident alien, subject to tax on a net basis 
(i.e., after the allowance of deductions) than if he were treated as a 
nonresident alien. If, however, B chooses to file as a nonresident in 
order to claim treaty benefits with respect to his share of R's subpart 
F income, his overall United States tax liability, including the portion 
attributable to the dividends, must be determined as if he were a 
nonresident alien.
    Example 3. C, a married alien individual with three children, is a 
resident of foreign country Y, under Y's internal law. Country Y is a 
party to an income tax convention with the United States. C is also a 
resident of the United States under the Internal Revenue Code. C is 
considered to be a resident of country Y under the convention. The 
convention specifically covers, among other items of income, personal 
services income, dividends and interest. C is sent by her country Y 
employer to work in the United States from January 1, 1985 until 
December 31, 1985. During 1985, C also earns United States source 
dividends and interest and incurs

[[Page 553]]

mortgage interest expenses on her personal residence. The United States-
Y treaty provides that remuneration for personal services performed in 
the United States by a country Y resident is exempt from United States 
tax if, among other things, the individual performing such services is 
present in the United States for a period that is not in excess of 183 
days. The treaty provides that the rate of United States tax on United 
States source dividends paid to residents of Y shall not exceed 15 
percent of the gross amount of the dividends and it exempts residents of 
Y from United States tax on United States source interest. In filing her 
1985 tax return, C may choose to file either as a resident alien without 
claiming any treaty benefits or as a nonresident alien if she desires to 
claim any treaty benefit. C files as a nonresident (i.e. by following 
the procedure described in Sec. 301.7701(b)-7(b)). Because C does not 
satisfy the requirements of the United States-Y treaty with regard to 
exempting personal services income from United States tax, C will be 
taxed on her personal services income at graduated rates under section 1 
of the Code pursuant to section 871(b) of the Code. She will not be 
entitled to deduct her mortgage interest expenses or to claim more than 
one personal exemption because she is taxed as a nonresident alien under 
the Code by virtue of her decision to claim treaty benefits, and section 
873 of the Code denies nonresidents the deduction for personal residence 
mortgage interest expense and generally limits them to only one personal 
exemption. C will be subject to a tax of 15 percent of the gross amount 
of her dividend income under section 871(a) of the Code as modified by 
the treaty, and she will be exempt from tax on her interest income. C is 
not entitled to file a joint return with her spouse even if he is a 
resident alien under the Code for 1985.
    Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that C 
does not choose to claim treaty benefits with respect to any items of 
income covered by the treaty (i.e., she files as a resident). Therefore, 
she is taxed as a resident under the Code and pays tax at graduated 
rates on her personal services income, dividends, and interest. In 
addition, she is entitled to deduct her mortgage interest expenses and 
to take personal exemptions for her spouse and three children. C will be 
entitled to file a joint return with her spouse if he is a resident 
alien for 1985 or, if he is a nonresident alien, C and her spouse may 
elect to file a joint return pursuant to section 6013.

the benefit of Secs. 301.7701(b)-3(b)(5), 301.7701(b)-3(c), and 
301.7701(b)-4(c)(1)) for purposes of the substantial presence test and 
for determining the individual's residency starting and termination 
dates. If an individual is considered to be a resident because of this 
paragraph and the individual is also a resident of a country with which 
the United States has an income tax convention pursuant to that 
convention, the individual shall be treated in the manner provided in 
Sec. 301.7701(b)-7 (a) (relating to the treatment of individuals who are 
dual residents).

this section, the Secretary or his or her delegate may in their sole 
discretion, when it is in the best interest of the government to do so

(a) of this section in determining the individual's days of presence in 
the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(i)-1  Definition of a taxable mortgage pool.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides rules for applying section 
7701(i), which defines taxable mortgage pools. The purpose of section 
7701(i) is to prevent income generated by a pool of real estate 
mortgages from escaping Federal income taxation when the pool is used to 
issue multiple class mortgage-backed securities. The regulations in this 
section and in Secs. 301.7701(i)-2 through 301.7701(i)-4 are to be 
applied in accordance with this purpose. The taxable mortgage pool 
provisions apply to entities or portions of entities that qualify for 
REMIC status but do not elect to be taxed as REMICs as well as to 
certain entities or portions of entities that do not qualify for REMIC 
status.
    (b) In general.  (1) A taxable mortgage pool is any entity or 
portion of an entity (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-2) that satisfies 
the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A) and this section as of any 
testing day (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)). An entity or 
portion of an entity satisfies the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A) 
and this section if substantially all of its assets are debt 
obligations, more than 50 percent of those debt obligations are real 
estate mortgages, the entity is the obligor under debt obligations with 
two or more maturities, and payments on the debt obligations under which 
the entity is obligor bear a relationship to payments on the debt 
obligations that the entity holds as assets.
    (2) Paragraph (c) of this section provides the tests for determining 
whether substantially all of an entity's assets are debt obligations and 
for determining whether more than 50 percent of its debt obligations are 
real estate mortgages. Paragraph (d) of this section defines real estate 
mortgages for purposes of the 50 percent test. Paragraph (e) of this 
section defines two or more maturities and paragraph (f) of this section 
provides rules for determining whether debt obligations bear a 
relationship to the assets held by an entity. Paragraph (g) of this 
section provides anti-avoidance rules. Section 301.7701(i)-2 provides 
rules for applying section 7701(i) to portions of entities and 
Sec. 301.7701(i)-3 provides effective dates. Section 301.7701(i)-4 
provides special rules for certain entities. For purposes of the 
regulations under section 7701(i), the term entity includes a portion of 
an entity (within the meaning of section 7701(i)(2)(B)), unless the 
context clearly indicates otherwise.
    (c) Asset composition tests--(1) Determination of amount of assets. 
An entity must use the Federal income tax basis of an asset for purposes 
of determining whether substantially all of its assets consist of debt 
obligations (or interests therein) and whether more than 50 percent of 
those debt obligations (or interests) consist of real estate mortgages 
(or interests therein). For purposes of this paragraph, an entity 
determines the basis of an asset with the assumption that the entity is 
not a taxable mortgage pool.
    (2) Substantially all--(i) In general. Whether substantially all of 
the assets of an entity consist of debt obligations (or interests 
therein) is based on all the facts and circumstances.
    (ii) Safe harbor. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section, if less than 80 percent of the assets of an entity consist of 
debt obligations (or interests therein), then less than substantially 
all of the assets of the entity consist of debt obligations (or 
interests therein).
    (3) Equity interests in pass-through arrangements. The equity 
interest of an entity in a partnership, S corporation, trust, REIT, or 
other pass-through arrangement is deemed to have the same composition as 
the entity's share of

[[Page 558]]

the assets of the pass-through arrangement. For example, if an entity's 
stock interest in a REIT has an adjusted basis of $20,000, and the 
assets of the REIT consist of equal portions of real estate mortgages 
and other real estate assets, then the entity is treated as holding 
$10,000 of real estate mortgages and $10,000 of other real estate 
assets.
    (4) Treatment of certain credit enhancement contracts--(i) In 
general. A credit enhancement contract (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section) is not treated as a separate asset of an 
entity for purposes of the asset composition tests set forth in section 
7701(i)(2)(A)(i), but instead is treated as part of the asset to which 
it relates. Furthermore, any collateral supporting a credit enhancement 
contract is not treated as an asset of an entity solely because it 
supports the guarantee represented by that contract.
    (ii) Credit enhancement contract defined. For purposes of this 
section, a credit enhancement contract is any arrangement whereby a 
person agrees to guarantee full or partial payment of the principal or 
interest payable on a debt obligation (or interest therein) or on a pool 
of such obligations (or interests), or full or partial payment on one or 
more classes of debt obligations under which an entity is the obligor, 
in the event of defaults or delinquencies on debt obligations, 
unanticipated losses or expenses incurred by the entity, or lower than 
expected returns on investments. Types of credit enhancement contracts 
may include, but are not limited to, pool insurance contracts, 
certificate guarantee insurance contracts, letters of credit, 
guarantees, or agreements whereby an entity, a mortgage servicer, or 
other third party agrees to make advances (regardless of whether, under 
the terms of the agreement, the payor is obligated, or merely permitted, 
to make those advances). An agreement by a debt servicer to advance to 
an entity out of its own funds an amount to make up for delinquent 
payments on debt obligations is a credit enhancement contract. An 
agreement by a debt servicer to pay taxes and hazard insurance premiums 
on property securing a debt obligation, or other expenses incurred to 
protect an entity's security interests in the collateral in the event 
that the debtor fails to pay such taxes, insurance premiums, or other 
expenses, is a credit enhancement contract.
    (5) Certain assets not treated as debt obligations--(i) In general. 
For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A), real estate mortgages that are 
seriously impaired are not treated as debt obligations. Whether a 
mortgage is seriously impaired is based on all the facts and 
circumstances including, but not limited to: the number of days 
delinquent, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt service coverage (based 
upon the operating income from the property), and the debtor's financial 
position and stake in the property. However, except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, no single factor in and of itself 
is determinative of whether a loan is seriously impaired.
    (ii) Safe harbor--(A) In general. Unless an entity is receiving or 
anticipates receiving payments with respect to a mortgage, a single 
family residential real estate mortgage is seriously impaired if 
payments on the mortgage are more than 89 days delinquent, and a multi-
family residential or commercial real estate mortgage is seriously 
impaired if payments on the mortgage are more than 59 days delinquent. 
Whether an entity anticipates receiving payments with respect to a 
mortgage is based on all the facts and circumstances.
    (B) Payments with respect to a mortgage defined. For purposes of 
paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, payments with respect to a 
mortgage mean any payments on the mortgage as defined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section if those payments are substantial and 
relatively certain as to amount and any payments on the mortgage as 
defined in paragraph (f)(2) (ii) or (iii) of this section.
    (C) Entity treated as not anticipating payments. With respect to any 
testing day (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)), an entity is 
treated as not having anticipated receiving payments on the mortgage as 
defined in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section if 180 days after the 
testing day, and despite making reasonable efforts to resolve the 
mortgage, the entity is not receiving such

[[Page 559]]

payments and has not entered into any agreement to receive such 
payments.
    (d) Real estate mortgages or interests therein defined--(1) In 
general. For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(i), the term real estate 
mortgages (or interests therein) includes all--
    (i) Obligations (including participations or certificates of 
beneficial ownership therein) that are principally secured by an 
interest in real property (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section);
    (ii) Regular and residual interests in a REMIC; and
    (iii) Stripped bonds and stripped coupons (as defined in section 
1286(e) (2) and (3)) if the bonds (as defined in section 1286(e)(1)) 
from which such stripped bonds or stripped coupons arose would have 
qualified as real estate mortgages or interests therein.
    (2) Interests in real property and real property defined--(i) In 
general. The definition of interests in real property set forth in 
Sec. 1.856-3(c) of this chapter and the definition of real property set 
forth in Sec. 1.856-3(d) of this chapter apply to define those terms for 
purposes of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (ii) Manufactured housing. For purposes of this section, the 
definition of real property includes manufactured housing, provided the 
properties qualify as single family residences under section 25(e)(10) 
and without regard to the treatment of the properties under state law.
    (3) Principally secured by an interest in real property--(i) Tests 
for determining whether an obligation is principally secured. For 
purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an obligation is 
principally secured by an interest in real property only if it satisfies 
either the test set out in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section or the 
test set out in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
    (A) The 80 percent test. An obligation is principally secured by an 
interest in real property if the fair market value of the interest in 
real property (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) securing 
the obligation was at least equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue 
price of the obligation at the time the obligation was originated (that 
is, the issue date). For purposes of this test, the fair market value of 
the real property interest is first reduced by the amount of any lien on 
the real property interest that is senior to the obligation being 
tested, and is reduced further by a proportionate amount of any lien 
that is in parity with the obligation being tested.
    (B) Alternative test. An obligation is principally secured by an 
interest in real property if substantially all of the proceeds of the 
obligation were used to acquire, improve, or protect an interest in real 
property that, at the origination date, is the only security for the 
obligation. For purposes of this test, loan guarantees made by Federal, 
state, local governments or agencies, or other third party credit 
enhancement, are not viewed as additional security for a loan. An 
obligation is not considered to be secured by property other than real 
property solely because the obligor is personally liable on the 
obligation.
    (ii) Obligations secured by real estate mortgages (or interests 
therein), or by combinations of real estate mortgages (or interests 
therein) and other assets--(A) In general. An obligation secured only by 
real estate mortgages (or interests therein), as defined in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, is treated as an obligation secured by an 
interest in real property to the extent of the value of the real estate 
mortgages (or interests therein). An obligation secured by both real 
estate mortgages (or interests therein) and other assets is treated as 
an obligation secured by an interest in real property to the extent of 
both the value of the real estate mortgages (or interests therein) and 
the value of so much of the other assets that constitute real property. 
Thus, under this paragraph, a collateralized mortgage obligation may be 
an obligation principally secured by an interest in real property. This 
section is applicable only to obligations issued after December 31, 
1991.
    (B) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of 
this paragraph (d)(3)(ii):

    Example. At the time it is originated, an obligation has an adjusted 
issue price of $300,000 and is secured by a $70,000 loan principally 
secured by an interest in a single family home, a fifty percent co-
ownership interest in a $400,000 parcel of land, and $80,000

[[Page 560]]

of stock. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the obligation 
is treated as secured by interests in real property and under paragraph 
(d)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the obligation is treated as principally 
secured by interests in real property.

    (e) Two or more maturities--(1) In general. For purposes of section 
7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), debt obligations have two or more maturities if they 
have different stated maturities or if the holders of the obligations 
possess different rights concerning the acceleration of or delay in the 
maturities of the obligations.
    (2) Obligations that are allocated credit risk unequally. Debt 
obligations that are allocated credit risk unequally do not have, by 
that reason alone, two or more maturities. Credit risk is the risk that 
payments of principal or interest will be reduced or delayed because of 
a default on an asset that supports the debt obligations.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (e):

    Example 1. (i) Corporation M transfers a pool of real estate 
mortgages to a trustee in exchange for Class A bonds and a certificate 
representing the residual beneficial ownership of the pool. All Class A 
bonds have a stated maturity of March 1, 2002, but if cash flows from 
the real estate mortgages and investments are sufficient, the trustee 
may select one or more bonds at random and redeem them earlier.
    (ii) The Class A bonds do not have different maturities. Each 
outstanding Class A bond has an equal chance of being redeemed because 
the selection process is random. The holders of the Class A bonds, 
therefore, have identical rights concerning the maturities of their 
obligations.
    Example 2. (i) Corporation N transfers a pool of real estate 
mortgages to a trustee in exchange for Class C bonds, Class D bonds, and 
a certificate representing the residual beneficial ownership of the 
pool. The Class D bonds are subordinate to the Class C bonds so that 
cash flow shortfalls due to defaults or delinquencies on the real estate 
mortgages are borne first by the Class D bond holders. The terms of the 
bonds are otherwise identical in all relevant aspects except that the 
Class D bonds carry a higher coupon rate because of the subordination 
feature.
    (ii) The Class C bonds and the Class D bonds share credit risk 
unequally because of the subordination feature. However, neither this 
difference, nor the difference in interest rates, causes the bonds to 
have different maturities. The result is the same if, in addition to the 
other terms described in paragraph (i) of this Example 2, the Class C 
bonds are accelerated as a result of the issuer becoming unable to make 
payments on the Class C bonds as they become due.

    (f) Relationship test--(1) In general. For purposes of section 
7701(i)(2)(A)(iii), payments on debt obligations under which an entity 
is the obligor (liability obligations) bear a relationship to payments 
(as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) on debt obligations an 
entity holds as assets (asset obligations) if under the terms of the 
liability obligations (or underlying arrangement) the timing and amount 
of payments on the liability obligations are in large part determined by 
the timing and amount of payments or projected payments on the asset 
obligations. For purposes of the relationship test, any payment 
arrangement, including a swap or other hedge, that achieves a 
substantially similar result is treated as satisfying the test. For 
example, any arrangement where the timing and amount of payments on 
liability obligations are determined by reference to a group of assets 
(or an index or other type of model) that has an expected payment 
experience similar to that of the asset obligations is treated as 
satisfying the relationship test.
    (2) Payments on asset obligations defined. For purposes of section 
7701(i)(2)(A)(iii) and this section, payments on asset obligations 
include--
    (i) A payment of principal or interest on an asset obligation, 
including a prepayment of principal, a payment under a credit 
enhancement contract (as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section) and a payment from a settlement at a discount (other than a 
substantial discount);
    (ii) A payment from a settlement at a substantial discount, but only 
if the settlement is arranged, whether in writing or otherwise, prior to 
the issuance of the liability obligations; and
    (iii) A payment from the foreclosure on or sale of an asset 
obligation, but only if the foreclosure or sale is arranged, whether in 
writing or otherwise, prior to the issuance of the liability 
obligations.

[[Page 561]]

    (3) Safe harbor for entities formed to liquidate assets. Payments on 
liability obligations of an entity do not bear a relationship to 
payments on asset obligations of the entity if--
    (i) The entity's organizational documents manifest clearly that the 
entity is formed for the primary purpose of liquidating its assets and 
distributing proceeds of liquidation;
    (ii) The entity's activities are all reasonably necessary to and 
consistent with the accomplishment of liquidating assets;
    (iii) The entity plans to satisfy at least 50 percent of the total 
issue price of each of its liability obligations having a different 
maturity with proceeds from liquidation and not with scheduled payments 
on its asset obligations; and
    (iv) The terms of the entity's liability obligations (or underlying 
arrangement) provide that within three years of the time it first 
acquires assets to be liquidated the entity either--
    (A) Liquidates; or
    (B) Begins to pass through without delay all payments it receives on 
its asset obligations (less reasonable allowances for expenses) as 
principal payments on its liability obligations in proportion to the 
adjusted issue prices of the liability obligations.
    (g) Anti-avoidance rules--(1) In general. For purposes of 
determining whether an entity meets the definition of a taxable mortgage 
pool, the Commissioner can disregard or make other adjustments to a 
transaction (or series of transactions) if the transaction (or series) 
is entered into with a view to achieving the same economic effect as 
that of an arrangement subject to section 7701(i) while avoiding the 
application of that section. The Commissioner's authority includes 
treating equity interests issued by a non-REMIC as debt if the entity 
issues equity interests that correspond to maturity classes of debt.
    (2) Certain investment trusts. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section, an ownership interest in an entity that is classified as a 
trust under Sec. 301.7701-4(c) will not be treated as a debt obligation 
of the trust.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (g):

    Example 1. (i) Partnership P, in addition to its other investments, 
owns $10,000,000 of mortgage pass-through certificates guaranteed by 
FNMA (FNMA Certificates). On May 15, 1997, Partnership P transfers the 
FNMA Certificates to Trust 1 in exchange for 100 Class A bonds and 
Certificate 1. The Class A bonds, under which Trust 1 is the obligor, 
have a stated principal amount of $5,000,000 and bear a relationship to 
the FNMA Certificates (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f)). 
Certificate 1 represents the residual beneficial ownership of the FNMA 
Certificates.
    (ii) On July 5, 1997, with a view to avoiding the application of 
section 7701(i), Partnership P transfers Certificate 1 to Trust 2 in 
exchange for 100 Class B bonds and Certificate 2. The Class B bonds, 
under which Trust 2 is the obligor, have a stated principal amount of 
$5,000,000, bear a relationship to the FNMA Certificates (within the 
meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f)), and have a different maturity than 
the Class A bonds (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(e)). 
Certificate 2 represents the residual beneficial ownership of 
Certificate 1.
    (iii) For purposes of determining whether Trust 1 is classified as a 
taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can disregard the separate 
existence of Trust 2 and treat Trust 1 and Trust 2 as a single trust.
    Example 2. (i) Corporation Q files a consolidated return with its 
two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Corporation R and Corporation S. 
Corporation R is in the business of building and selling single family 
homes. Corporation S is in the business of financing sales of those 
homes.
    (ii) On August 10, 1998, Corporation S transfers a pool of its real 
estate mortgages to Trust 3, taking back Certificate 3 which represents 
beneficial ownership of the pool. On September 25, 1998, with a view to 
avoiding the application of section 7701(i), Corporation R issues bonds 
that have different maturities (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-
1(e)) and that bear a relationship (within the meaning of 
Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f)) to the real estate mortgages in Trust 3. The 
holders of the bonds have an interest in a credit enhancement contract 
that is written by Corporation S and collateralized with Certificate 3.
    (iii) For purposes of determining whether Trust 3 is classified as a 
taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat Trust 3 as the obligor 
of the bonds issued by Corporation R.
    Example 3. (i) Corporation X, in addition to its other assets, owns 
$110,000,000 in Treasury securities. From time to time, Corporation X 
acquires pools of real estate mortgages,

[[Page 562]]

which it immediately uses to issue multiple-class debt obligations.
    (ii) On October 1, 1996, Corporation X transfers $20,000,000 in 
Treasury securities to Trust 4 in exchange for Class C bonds, Class D 
bonds, Class E bonds, and Certificate 4. Trust 4 is the obligor of the 
bonds. The different classes of bonds have the same stated maturity 
date, but if cash flows from the Trust 4 assets exceed the amounts 
needed to make interest payments, the trustee uses the excess to retire 
the classes of bonds in alphabetical order. Certificate 4 represents the 
residual beneficial ownership of the Treasury securities.
    (iii) With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), 
Corporation X reserves the right to replace any Trust 4 asset with real 
estate mortgages or guaranteed mortgage pass-through certificates. In 
the event the right is exercised, cash flows on the real estate 
mortgages and guaranteed pass-through certificates will be used in the 
same manner as cash flows on the Treasury securities. Corporation X 
exercises this right of replacement on February 1, 1997.
    (iv) For purposes of determining whether Trust 4 is classified as a 
taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat February 1, 1997, as a 
testing day (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)). The result 
is the same if Corporation X has an obligation, rather than a right, to 
replace the Trust 4 assets with real estate mortgages and guaranteed 
pass-through certificates.
    Example 4. (i) Corporation Y, in addition to its other assets, owns 
$1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal property. On November 1, 
1995, Corporation Y begins negotiating a $2,000,000 loan to individual 
A. As security for the loan, A offers a first deed of trust on land 
worth $1,700,000.
    (ii) With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), 
Corporation Y induces A to place the land in a partnership in which A 
will have a 95 percent interest and agrees to accept the partnership 
interest as security for the $2,000,000 loan. Thereafter, the loan to A, 
together with the $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal 
property, are transferred to Trust 5 and used to issue bonds that have 
different maturities (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(e)) and 
that bear a relationship (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f)) 
to the $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal property and the 
loan to A.
    (iii) For purposes of determining whether Trust 5 is a taxable 
mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat the loan to A as an obligation 
secured by an interest in real property rather than as an obligation 
secured by an interest in a partnership.
    Example 5. (i) Corporation Z, in addition to its other assets, owns 
$3,000,000 in notes secured by interests in retail shopping centers. 
Partnership L, in addition to its other assets, owns $20,000,000 in 
notes that are principally secured by interests in single family homes 
and $3,500,000 in notes that are principally secured by interests in 
personal property.
    (ii) On December 1, 1995, Partnership L asks Corporation Z for two 
separate loans, one in the amount of $9,375,000 and another in the 
amount of $625,000. Partnership L offers to collateralize the $9,375,000 
loan with $10,312,500 of notes secured by interests in single family 
homes and the $625,000 loan with $750,000 of notes secured by interests 
in personal property. Corporation Z has made similar loans to 
Partnership L in the past.
    (iii) With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), 
Corporation Z induces Partnership L to accept a single $10,000,000 loan 
and to post as collateral $7,500,000 of the notes secured by interests 
in single family homes and all $3,500,000 of the notes secured by 
interests in personal property. Ordinarily, Corporation Z would not make 
a loan on these terms. Thereafter, the loan to Partnership L, together 
with the $3,000,000 in notes secured by interests in retail shopping 
centers, are transferred to Trust 6 and used to issue bonds that have 
different maturities (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(e)) and 
that bear a relationship (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f)) 
to the loans secured by interests in retail shopping centers and the 
loan to Partnership L.
    (iv) For purposes of determining whether Trust 6 is a taxable 
mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat the $10,000,000 loan to 
Partnership L as consisting of a $9,375,000 obligation secured by 
interests in real property and a $625,000 obligation secured by 
interests in personal property. Under Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(d)(3)(ii)(A), 
the notes secured by single family homes are treated as $7,500,000 of 
interests in real property. Under Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(d)(3)(i)(A), 
$7,500,000 of interests in real property are sufficient to treat a 
$9,375,000 obligation as principally secured by an interest in real 
property ($7,500,000 equals 80 percent of $9,375,000).

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(i)-2  Special rules for portions of entities.

    (a) Portion defined. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 301.7701(i)-1, a portion of an entity includes all 
assets that support one or more of the same issues of debt obligations. 
For this purpose, an asset supports a debt obligation if, under the 
terms of the debt obligation (or underlying arrangement), the timing and

[[Page 563]]

amount of payments on the debt obligation are in large part determined, 
either directly or indirectly, by the timing and amount of payments or 
projected payments on the asset or a group of assets that includes the 
asset. Indirect payment arrangements include, for example, a swap or 
other hedge, or arrangements where the timing and amount of payments on 
the debt obligations are determined by reference to a group of assets 
(or an index or other type of model) that has an expected payment 
experience similar to that of the assets. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term payments includes all proceeds and receipts from an 
asset.
    (b) Certain assets and rights to assets disregarded--(1) Credit 
enhancement assets. An asset that qualifies as a credit enhancement 
contract (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(ii)) is not included in 
a portion as a separate asset, but is treated as part of the assets in 
the portion to which it relates under Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(i). An 
asset that does not qualify as a credit enhancement contract (as defined 
in Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(ii)), but that nevertheless serves the same 
function as a credit enhancement contract, is not included in a portion 
as a separate asset or otherwise.
    (2) Assets unlikely to service obligations. A portion does not 
include assets that are unlikely to produce any significant cash flows 
for the holders of the debt obligations. This paragraph applies even if 
the holders of the debt obligations are legally entitled to cash flows 
from the assets. Thus, for example, even if the sale of a building would 
cause a series of debt obligations to be redeemed, the building is not 
included in a portion if it is not likely to be sold.
    (3) Recourse. An asset is not included in a portion solely because 
the holders of the debt obligations have recourse to the holder of that 
asset.
    (c) Portion as obligor--(1) In general. For purposes of section 
7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), a portion of an entity is treated as the obligor of 
all debt obligations supported by the assets in that portion.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of 
this section:

    Example. (i) Corporation Z owns $1,000,000,000 in assets including 
an office complex and $90,000,000 of real estate mortgages.
    (ii) On November 30, 1998, Corporation Z issues eight classes of 
bonds, Class A through Class H. Each class is secured by a separate 
letter of credit and by a lien on the office complex. One group of the 
real estate mortgages supports Class A through Class D, another group 
supports Class E through Class G, and a third group supports Class H. It 
is anticipated that the cash flows from each group of mortgages will 
service its related bonds.
    (iii) Each of the following constitutes a separate portion of 
Corporation Z: the group of mortgages supporting Class A through Class 
D; the group of mortgages supporting Class E through Class G; and the 
group of mortgages supporting Class H. No other asset is included in any 
of the three portions notwithstanding the lien of the bonds on the 
office complex and the fact that Corporation Z is the issuer of the 
bonds. The letters of credit are treated as incidents of the mortgages 
to which they relate.
    (iv) For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), each portion 
described above is treated as the obligor of the bonds of that portion, 
notwithstanding the fact that Corporation Z is the legal obligor with 
respect to the bonds.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(i)-3  Effective dates and duration of taxable mortgage pool classification.

    (a) Effective dates. Except as otherwise provided, the regulations 
under section 7701(i) are effective and applicable September 6, 1995.
    (b) Entities in existence on December 31, 1991--(1) In general. For 
transitional rules concerning the application of section 7701(i) to 
entities in existence on December 31, 1991, see section 675(c) of the 
Tax Reform Act of 1986.
    (2) Special rule for certain transfers. A transfer made to an entity 
on or after September 6, 1995, is a substantial transfer for purposes of 
section 675(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 only if--
    (i) The transfer is significant in amount; and
    (ii) The transfer is connected to the entity's issuance of related 
debt obligations (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that 
have different maturities (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701-1(e)).
    (3) Related debt obligation. A related debt obligation is a debt 
obligation whose payments bear a relationship (within the meaning of 
Sec. 301.7701-1(f)) to

[[Page 564]]

payments on debt obligations that the entity holds as assets.
    (4) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example. On December 31, 1991, Partnership Q holds a pool of real 
estate mortgages that it acquired through retail sales of single family 
homes. Partnership Q raises $10,000,000 on October 25, 1996, by using 
this pool to issue related debt obligations with multiple maturities. 
The transfer of the $10,000,000 to Partnership Q is a substantial 
transfer (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-3(b)(2)).

    (c) Duration of taxable mortgage pool classification--(1) 
Commencement and duration. An entity is classified as a taxable mortgage 
pool on the first testing day that it meets the definition of a taxable 
mortgage pool. Once an entity is classified as a taxable mortgage pool, 
that classification continues through the day the entity retires its 
last related debt obligation.
    (2) Testing day defined. A testing day is any day on or after 
September 6, 1995, on which an entity issues a related debt obligation 
(as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that is significant in 
amount.

<R05>
Sec. 301.7701(i)-4  Special rules for certain entities.

    (a) States and municipalities--(1) In general. Regardless of whether 
an entity satisfies any of the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A), an 
entity is not classified as a taxable mortgage pool if--
    (i) The entity is a State, territory, a possession of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision thereof 
(within the meaning of Sec. 1.103-1(b) of this chapter), or is empowered 
to issue obligations on behalf of one of the foregoing;
    (ii) The entity issues the debt obligations in the performance of a 
governmental purpose; and
    (iii) The entity holds the remaining interests in all assets that 
support those debt obligations until the debt obligations issued by the 
entity are retired.
    (2) Governmental purpose. The term governmental purpose means an 
essential governmental function within the meaning of section 115. A 
governmental purpose does not include the mere packaging of debt 
obligations for re-sale on the secondary market even if any profits from 
the sale are used in the performance of an essential governmental 
function.
    (3) Determinations by the Commissioner. If an entity is not 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but has a similar 
purpose, then the Commissioner may determine that the entity is not 
classified as a taxable mortgage pool.
    (b) REITs. [Reserved]
    (c) Subchapter S corporations--(1) In general. An entity that is 
classified as a taxable mortgage pool may not elect to be an S 
corporation under section 1362(a) or maintain S corporation status.
    (2) Portion of an S corporation treated as a separate corporation. 
An S corporation is not treated as a member of an affiliated group under 
section 1361(b)(2)(A) solely because a portion of the S corporation is 
treated as a separate corporation under section 7701(i).

Service.
    (2) Issuance without an application. The Ombudsman may issue a 
taxpayer assistance order in the absence of an application under section 
7811(a).
    (3) Duly authorized taxpayer's representative. A ``duly authorized 
taxpayer's representative'' is any attorney, certified public 
accountant, enrolled agent, enrolled actuary, or any other person 
permitted to represent the taxpayer before the Internal Revenue Service 
who is not disbarred or suspended from practice before the Internal 
Revenue Service and who has a written power of attorney executed by the 
taxpayer.
    (4) Significant hardship--(i) Determination required. A 
determination of significant hardship is required to be made by the 
Ombudsman prior to the issuance of a taxpayer assistance order.
    (ii) Term Defined.  The term significant hardship means a serious 
privation caused or about to be caused to the taxpayer as the result of 
the particular manner in which the revenue laws are being administered 
by the Internal Revenue Service. Mere economic or personal inconvenience 
to the taxpayer does not constitute significant hardship.
    (5) Finding different from relief.  A finding that a taxpayer is 
suffering or about to suffer a significant hardship as a result of the 
manner in which the internal revenue laws are being administered by the 
Internal Revnue Service will not automatically result in relief being 
granted to a taxpayer under this section. A finding of ``significant 
hardship'' is separate and distinct from a determination that the 
taxpayer will be granted relief. The granting of relief requires an 
examination of the behavior of the taxpayer and of the action or 
inaction of the Internal Revenue Service that causes or is about to 
cause the significant hardship to the taxpayer.
    (b) Application for taxpayer assistance order--(1) Form. The 
application for a taxpayer assistance order shall be made on a Form 911 
(Application for Taxpayer Assistance Order to Relieve Hardship) 
available from any local office of the Internal Revenue Service or in a 
written statement which shall contain the following information:
    (i) Name, social security number (or the employer identification 
number), and current mailing address of the taxpayer submitting the 
application.
    (ii) Kind of tax (individual, corporate, etc.) and tax period or 
periods involved.
    (iii) Description of the Internal Revenue Service action or proposed 
action which is causing or is about to cause a

[[Page 566]]

significant hardship to the taxpayer and, if known, the Internal Revenue 
Service office and personnel involved.
    (iv) Description of the specific hardship caused or about to be 
caused and the kind of relief requested.
    (v) Signature of the taxpayer/applicant or duly authorized 
representative.
    (2) Manner. An application for a taxpayer assistance order shall be 
filed with the Internal Revenue Service Problem Resolution Office in the 
district where the taxpayer resides. Overseas applicants having a APO or 
FPO address shall file applications with the Internal Revenue Service, 
Problem Resolution Office where the return was filed. All other overseas 
applicants shall file applications with the Internal Revenue Service, 
Problem Resolution Office, Assistant Commissioner (International), 
Washington, DC. Where appropriate, these Problem Resolution offices may 
refer an application for a taxpayer assistance order to another office 
of the Internal Revenue Service.
    (3) Time. An application for a taxpayer assistance order shall be 
submitted within a reasonable time after the taxpayer becomes aware of 
the significant hardship or the potential significant hardship.
    (c) Contents of Taxpayer Assistance Orders--(1) Terms of order. Upon 
deciding that a taxpayer is suffering or about to suffer a significant 
hardship as a result of the manner in which the internal revenue laws 
are being administered, the Ombudsman may issue a taxpayer assistance 
order requiring the Internal Revenue Service to--
    (i) Release levied property (to the extent that the Internal Revenue 
Service may by law release such property), or
    (ii) Stop any action or refrain from taking further action against a 
taxpayer pursuant to:
    (A) Chapter 64 (relating to collection),
    (B) Chapter 70, subchapter B (relating to bankruptcy and 
receiverships),
    (C) Chapter 78 (relating to discovery of liability and enforcement 
of title), or
    (D) Any other section of the Internal Revenue Code under which the 
Internal Revenue Service is taking or is about to take administrative 
action against the taxpayer that causes or will cause a significant 
hardship.
    (2) Binding effect. A taxpayer assistance order is binding on the 
Internal Revenue Service unless reversed by an official authorized to 
modify or rescind such an order as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (3) Scope. The terms of a taxpayer assistance order may require the 
release from levy of property of the taxpayer to the extent that the 
Internal Revenue Service will by law release such property. In the 
absence of an overpayment there is, for example, no authority under 
which the Internal Revenue Service may release sums which have been 
credited against the taxpayer's liability and deposited into the 
Treasury of the United States. A taxpayer assistance order may generally 
not be issued with respect to the investigation of any criminal tax 
violation and generally may not be issued to enjoin an act of the Office 
of Chief Counsel (with the exception of Appeals). A taxpayer assistance 
order will not be issued to contest the merits of any tax liability nor 
is a taxpayer assistance order intended to be a substitute for or an 
addition to any established administrative or judicial review procedure.
    (d) Authority to modify or rescind. A taxpayer assistance order may 
be modified or rescinded only by the Ombudsman, a district director, a 
service center director, a compliance center director, a regional 
director of appeals, or the superiors of such officials. A modification 
or rescission by one of these designated officials may be elevated by 
the Ombudsman to the superior of such official.
    (e) Suspension of statutes of limitations--(1) In general. The 
running of the applicable period of limitations for any action which is 
the subject of a taxpayer assistance order shall be suspended for the 
period beginning on the date the Ombudsman receives an application for a 
taxpayer assistance order in the form, manner, and time specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section and ending on the date on which the 
Ombudsman makes a determination with respect to the application, and for 
any additional period specified by the Ombudsman in an order issued 
pursuant to

[[Page 567]]

a taxpayer's application. For the purpose of computing the period 
suspended, all calendar days except the date of receipt of the 
application shall be included.
    (2) Date of decision. The ``date on which the Ombudsman makes a 
decision with respect to the application'' is the date on which the 
taxpayer's request for a taxpayer assistance order is denied, or 
agreement is reached with the involved function of the Service, or a 
taxpayer assistance order is issued (except that when the taxpayer 
assistance order is reviewed by an official who may modify or rescind 
the taxpayer assistance order as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the decision date is the date on which such review is 
completed).
    (3) Periods suspended. The periods of limitations which are 
suspended under section 7811(d) are those which apply to the taxable 
periods to which the application for a taxpayer assistance order relate 
or the taxable periods specifically indicated in the terms of a taxpayer 
assistance order.

    Example 1. On August 31, 1989, the Internal Revenue Service levies 
on funds in the taxpayer's checking account. On September 1, 1989 (at 
which time 7 months remain before the period of limitations on 
collection after assessment will expire on April 1, 1990) the Ombudsman 
receives the taxpayer's written application for a taxpayer assistance 
order. Subsequently, on September 6, 1989, the Ombudsman determines that 
the levy has caused a significant hardship and the Internal Revenue 
Service function which served the levy agrees to release the levy. The 
levy is released. As a result of the application and the decision by the 
Ombudsman and the involved function of the Service resolving the 
hardship, the statute of limitations on collection after assessment is 
suspended from the date the Ombudsman received the application, 
September 1, 1989, until the date on which the decision was made to 
release the levy, September 6, 1989. Therefore, the statute of 
limitations on collection after assessment will not expire until after 
April 6, 1990, which is 7 months plus 5 days after the date on which the 
application for a taxpayer assistance order was received by the 
Ombudsman.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that the 
Internal Revenue Service function which served the levy does not agree 
to release the levy, and the Ombudsman, having made a determination that 
the levy is causing a significant hardship, issues a taxpayer assistance 
order on September 6, 1989, in which the levy is ordered to be released 
and specifies that the statute of limitations on collection after 
assessment is suspended for an additional 15 days. The period of 
limitations on collection after assessment will therefore not expire 
until after April 21, 1990, which is 7 months and 20 days (5 days plus 
15 days) after the application for the taxpayer assistance order was 
received by the Ombudsman.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2 except that the 
Ombudsman does not specifically suspend the statute of limitations on 
collection after assessment for an additional number of days in the 
taxpayer assistance order, but rather the function seeks modification or 
rescission of the taxpayer assistance order and the appropriate official 
charged with that responsibility completes his consideration of the 
assistance order on September 8, 1989. The period of limitations on 
collection after assessment will therefore not expire until after April 
8, 1990, which is 7 months and 7 days after the application for the 
taxpayer assistance order was received by the Ombudsman.

    (4) Absence of a written application. The statute of limitations is 
not suspended in cases where the Ombudsman issues an order in the 
absence of a written application for relief by the taxpayer or the 
taxpayer's duly authorized representative.
    (f) Independent action of Ombudsman. The Ombudsman may take any of 
the actions described in section 7811(b) in the absence of an 
application by the taxpayer.
    (g) Ombudsman. The term ``Ombudsman'' includes any designee of the 
Ombudsman, such as Problem Resolution Officers in Internal Revenue 
Service regional and district offices and at Internal Revenue Service 
compliance and service centers.
    (h) Effective Date.  These regulations are effective as of March 20, 
1992.

<R05>
Sec. 301.9000-1   Procedure to be followed by officers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service upon receipt of a request or demand for disclosure of

    (b) Definitions. When used in this section--
    (1) Internal revenue records or information. The term ``internal 
revenue records or information'' means any records (including copies 
thereof) or information, made or obtained by, furnished to, or coming to 
the knowledge of, any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue 
Service while acting in his official capacity, or because of his 
official status, with respect to the administration of the internal 
revenue laws or any other laws administered by or concerning the 
Internal Revenue Service.

revenue officer and employee'' means all officers and employees of the 
United States, engaged in the administration and enforcement of the 
internal revenue laws or any other laws administered by the Internal 
Revenue Service, appointed or employed by, or subject to the directions, 
instructions or orders of, the Secretary of the Treasury or his 
delegate.
    (3) Demand. The term ``demand'' means any subpoena, notice of 
deposition either upon oral examination or written interrogatory, or 
other order, of any court, administrative agency, or other authority.
    (c) Disclosure of internal revenue records or information prohibited 
without prior approval of the Commissioner. The disclosure, including 
the production, of internal revenue records or information to any person 
outside the Treasury Department or to any court, administrative agency, 
or other authority, in response to any request or demand for the 
disclosure of such records or information shall be made only with the 
prior approval of the Commissioner. However, nothing in this section 
shall restrict the disclosure of internal revenue records or information 
which the Commissioner has determined is authorized under any provision 
of statute, Executive order, or regulations, or for which a procedure 
has been established by the Commissioner. For example, this section does 
not restrict the inspection of returns and approved applications for tax 
exemption inspection of which is governed by sections 6103 and 6104 of 
the Code and the Executive orders and regulations issued thereunder, nor 
does it restrict the disclosure of internal revenue records or 
information which is requested by U.S. attorneys or attorneys of the 
Department of Justice for use in cases which arise under the internal 
revenue laws or related statutes and which are referred by the 
Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice for prosecution 
or defense.
    (d) Delegation to Commissioner of authority to determine disclosure 
and establish procedures; procedure in the event of a request or demand 
for disclosure--(1) Delegation to Commissioner. The Commissioner is 
hereby authorized to determine whether or not officers and employees of 
the Internal Revenue Service will be permitted to disclose internal 
revenue records or information in response to:
    (i) A request by any court, administrative agency, or other 
authority, or by any person, for the disclosure of such records or 
information, or
    (ii) A demand for the disclosure of such records or information.

The Commissioner is also authorized to establish such procedures as he 
may deem necessary with respect to the disclosure of internal revenue 
records or information by internal revenue officers and employees. Any 
determination by the Commissioner as to whether internal revenue records 
or information will be disclosed, or any procedure established by him in 
connection therewith, will be made in accordance with applicable 
statutes, Executive orders, and regulations, and such instructions as 
may be issued by the Secretary or his delegate. Notwithstanding the 
preceding provisions of this subparagraph, the Commissioner shall, where 
either he or the Secretary deems it appropriate, refer the opposing of a 
request or demand for disclosure of internal revenue records or 
information to the Secretary.
    (2) Procedure in the event of a request or demand for internal 
revenue records or

[[Page 569]]

information--(i) Request procedure. Any officer or employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service who receives a request for internal revenue 
records or information, the disposition of which is not covered by a 
procedure established by the Commissioner, shall promptly communicate 
the contents of the request to the Commissioner through the appropriate 
supervisor for the district or region in which he serves. Such officer 
or employee shall await instructions from the Commissioner concerning 
the response to the request. For the procedure to be followed in the 
event a person making a request seeks to obtain a court order or other 
demand requiring the production of internal revenue records or 
information, see subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.

communicate the contents of the demand to the Commissioner through the 
appropriate supervisor for the district or region in which he serves. 
Such officer or employee shall await instructions from the Commissioner 
concerning the response to the demand. If it is determined by the 
Commissioner that the demand should be opposed, the U.S. attorney, his 
assistant, or other appropriate legal representative shall be requested 
to respectfully inform the court, administrative agency, or other 
authority that the Commissioner has instructed the officer or employee 
to refuse to disclose the internal revenue records or information 
sought. If instructions have not been received from the Commissioner at 
the time when the officer or employee is required to appear before the 
court, administrative agency, or other authority in response to the 
demand, the U.S. attorney, his assistant, or other appropriate legal 
representative shall be requested to appear with the officer or employee 
upon whom the demand has been served and request additional time in 
which to receive such instructions. In the event the court, 
administrative agency, or other authority rules adversely with respect 
to the refusal to disclose the records or information pursuant to the 
instructions of the Commissioner, or declines to defer a ruling until 
instructions from the Commissioner have been received, the officer or 
employee upon whom the demand has been served shall, pursuant to this 
section, respectfully decline to disclose the internal revenue records 
or information sought.
    (e) Record of seizure and sale of real estate. Record 21, ``Record 
of seizure and sale of real estate'', is open for public inspection in 
offices of district directors of internal revenue and copies are 
furnished upon application.
    (f) State liquor, tobacco, firearms, or explosives cases. Assistant 
Regional Commissioners (alcohol, tobacco and firearms) or the Director, 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division may, in the interest of 
Federal and State law enforcement, upon receipt of demands or requests 
of State authorities, and at the expense of the State, authorize special 
investigators and other employees under their supervision to attend 
trials and administrative hearings in liquor, tobacco, firearms, or 
explosives cases in which the State is a party, produce records, and 
testify as to facts coming to their knowledge in their official 
capacities: Provided, That such production or testimony will not divulge 
information contrary to section 7213 of the Code, nor divulge 
information subject to the restrictions in section 5848. See also 18 
U.S.C. 1905.
    (g) Penalties. Any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue 
Service who disobeys the provisions of this section will be subject to 
dismissal and may incur criminal liability.
    (h) Disclosure of economic stabilization matters. (1) The 
Commissioner, in his discretion, is specifically authorized to divulge 
or disclose to a complainant or to an individual with specific knowledge 
of a complaint, the nature and result of the investigation of said 
complaint in circumstances where no violation has been found.
    (2) The provisions of this paragraph are prescribed under the 
authority of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended, Pub. L. 
91-379, 84 Stat. 799;

Sec. 301.9001  Statutory provisions; Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978.

    Section 302 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 
1978 (92 Stat. 629) provides as follows:

    Sec. 302. (a) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the 
United States an Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund in an amount 
not to exceed $200,000,000, except that such limitation shall be 
increased to the extent necessary to permit any moneys recovered or 
collected which are referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section to 
be paid into the Fund. The Fund shall be administered by the Secretary 
<SUP>1</SUP> and the Secretary of the Treasury as specified in this 
title. The Fund may sue and be sued in its own name.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1</SUP> ``Secretary'' wherever used in this section means the 
Secretary of Transportation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The Fund shall be composed of--
    (1) All fees collected pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; 
and
    (2) All other moneys recovered or collected on behalf of the Fund 
under section 308 or any other provision of this title.
    (c) The Fund shall be immediately available for--
    (1) Removal costs described in section 301(22):
    (2) The processing and settlement claims under section 307 of this 
title (including the costs of assessing injury to, or destruction of, 
natural resources); and
    (3) Subject to such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts, 
all administrative and personnel costs of the Federal Government 
incident to the administration of this title, including, but not limited 
to, the claims settlement activities and adjudicatory and judicial 
proceedings, whether or not such costs are recoverable under section 308 
of this title.
    The Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations designating 
the person or persons who may obligate available money in the Fund for 
such purposes.
    (d)(1) The Secretary shall levy and the Secretary of the Treasury 
shall collect a fee of not to exceed 3 cents per barrel on oil obtained 
from the Outer Continental Shelf, which shall be imposed on the owner of 
the oil when such oil is produced.
    (2) The Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the 
Secretary, may promulgate reasonable regulations relating to the 
collection of the fees authorized by paragraph (1) of this subsection 
and, from time to time, the modification thereof. Any modification shall 
become effective on the date specified in the regulation making such 
modification, but no earlier than the ninetieth day following the date 
such regulation is published in the Federal Register. Any modification 
of the fee shall be designed to insure that the Fund is maintained at a 
level of not less than $100,000,000 and not more than $200,000,000. No 
regulation that sets or modifies fees, whether or not in effect, may be 
stayed by any court pending completion of judicial review of such 
regulation.
    (3)(A) Any person who fails to collect or pay any fee as required by 
any regulation promulgated under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall 
be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000, to be assessed by 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in addition to the fee required to be 
collected or paid and the interest on such fee at the rate such fee 
would have earned if collected or paid when due and invested in special 
obligations of the United States in accordance with subsection (e)(2) of 
this section. Upon the failure of any person so liable to pay any 
penalty, fee, or interest upon demand, the Attorney General may, at the 
request of the Secretary of the Treasury, bring an action in the name of 
the Fund against that person for such amount.
    (B) Any person who falsifies records or documents required to be 
maintained under any regulation promulgated under this subsection shall 
be subject to prosecution for a violation of section 1001 of title 18, 
United States Code.
    (4) The Secretary of the Treasury may, by regulation, designate the 
reasonably necessary records and documents to be kept by persons from 
whom fees are to be collected pursuant to paragraph (1) of this 
subsection, and the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller 
General of the United States shall have access to such records and 
documents for the purpose of audit and examination.

[[Page 571]]

    (e)(1) The Secretary shall determine the level of funding required 
for immediate access in order to meet potential obligations of the Fund.
    (2) The Secretary of the Treasury may invest any excess in the Fund 
above the level determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection, in 
interest-bearing special obligations of the United States. Such special 
obligations may be redeemed at any time in accordance with the terms of 
the special issue and pursuant to regulations promulgated by the 
Secretary of the Treasury. The interest on, and the proceeds from the 
sale of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be deposited in and 
credited to the Fund.
    (f) If at any time the moneys available in the Fund are insufficient 
to meet the obligations of the Fund, the Secretary shall issue to the 
Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in the forms and 
denominations, bearing the interest rates and maturities, and subject to 
such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the 
Treasury. Redemption of such notes or other obligations shall be made by 
the Secretary from moneys in the Fund. Such notes or other obligations 
shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on 
outstanding marketable obligations of comparable maturity. The Secretary 
of the Treasury shall purchase any notes or other obligations issued 
under this subsection and, for that purpose, he is authorized to use as 
a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities 
issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act. The purpose for which 
securities may be issued under that Act are extended to include any 
purchase of such notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the 
Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations 
acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and 
sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other 
obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United 
States.

(Sec. 302(d) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 
(92 Stat. 672) and sec. 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (68A 
Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805))

[T.D. 7697, 45 FR 33974, May 21, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 301.9001-1  Collection of fee.

    (a) Imposition of fee--(1) In general. Under section 302(d) of the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (Act), the Internal 
Revenue Service is authorized to collect a fee of not more than 3 cents 
per barrel on oil that is obtained from the Outer Continental Shelf. 
This fee is established by the Commandant, United States Coast Guard, 
and is imposed on the owner of the oil as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section. The barrels subject to the fee shall be those barrels 
reported by the owner of the oil (Sec. 301.9001-1 (a)(2)), or a person 
authorized to act for the owner, on the monthly royalty reports, Form 9-
153, filed with the U.S. Geological Survey as required by 30 CFR 250.94. 
For the purpose of computing this fee, the owner of the oil shall 
measure the Outer Continental Shelf oil production by employing the 
criteria of the U.S. Geological Survey contained in 30 CFR 250.60 and 
Outer Continental Shelf Gulf of Mexico Order 13. No reduction in the 
amount due will be permitted by reason of theoretical or actual oil lost 
in transit. To ensure that the Fund is maintained at a level of not less 
than $100,000,000 and not more than $200,000,000, the Commandant, United 
States Coast Guard, may modify the amount of this fee.
    (2) Owner of oil. For the purposes of Secs. 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, 
and 301.9001-3, the owner of oil is the person in whom is vested 
ownership of the oil as it is produced at the wellhead without regard to 
the existence of contractual arrangements for the sale or other 
disposition of the oil between such a person and third parties. Under 
this rule, the Federal government entitlement to royalty oil does not 
constitute ownership of oil by the Federal government at the time of 
production.
    (3) Example. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. X is the owner of oil produced on the Outer Continental 
Shelf. During one reporting period, 10,000 barrels of oil were obtained 
from this location. X will use a portion of this oil to make a royalty 
payment to the United States government. X also has a contract with Y to 
sell Y the remaining barrels of oil. For the purpose of the Act, X is 
the owner of the oil and must pay a fee of 3 cents per barrel on all 
10,000 barrels of oil.
    (4) Cross-references. See Sec. 301.9001-2(a) for the definition of 
barrel, Sec. 301.9001-2(b) for the definition of oil, and Sec. 301.9001-
2(c) for the definition of person.
    (5) Effective Date. The provisions of Secs. 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, 
and 301.9001-3 are effective on July 25, 1979, at 7:00

[[Page 572]]

a.m., local time. If, however, the established practice has been to 
gauge oil production at a time other than 7:00 a.m., the effective date 
is July 25, 1979, at the time production has been gauged.
    (b) Collection of fee. The Internal Revenue Service shall collect 
the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Act. Administrative procedures 
for the collection of this fee shall be prescribed from time to time by 
the Commissioner. The Commissioner may designate the reasonably 
necessary records and documents to be kept by the person or persons from 
whom the fee is collected. See also the regulations under 33 CFR 135.103 
for additional rules relating to the implementation of the Act.
    (c) Time and place for payment of the fee--(1) In general. Payment 
of the fee shall be made in accordance with the rules established in 
paragraph (c)(2), (3) and (4) of this section. When a deposit is 
required by these rules, it must be filed with the Internal Revenue 
Service Center, Austin, Texas 73301 using Form 6008, Fee Deposit for 
Offshore Oil. Adjustments required in the amount paid during the 
calendar quarter to reflect the actual amount due for the quarter shall 
be made on Form 6009, Quarterly Report of Fees Due. Form 6009 must be 
filed on or before the last day of the month following the end of the 
calendar quarter with the Austin Service Center. The rules under section 
7502, relating to the treatment of timely mailing as timely filing and 
paying, and section 7503, relating to the time for performance of acts 
where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday are 
applicable to the filing of Form 6009.
    (2) $100 or less of fees. If the owner of oil is liable in any 
calendar quarter for $100 or less of fees, the owner or a person 
authorized to act for the owner may either deposit this amount or pay 
the full amount of the fee when Form 6009 is filed.
    (3) More than $100 of fees. If the owner of oil is liable in the 
first or second month of the calendar quarter for more than $100 of fees 
and is not required to make a semimonthly deposit (see paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section), the owner or a person authorized to act for the owner 
must deposit the amount on or before the last day of the following month 
following the the month of production.
    (4) More than $2000 of fees. The owner of oil who is liable for more 
than $2000 of fees for any month of a calendar quarter must deposit fees 
for the following quarter (regardless of amount) on a semimonthly basis. 
The deposit must be made on or before the ninth day following the 
semimonthly period for which it is reportable. The first deposit for a 
month may be reasonably estimated when an accounting of oil production 
is normally done by the month. Under these circumstances, the second for 
that month deposit should be adjusted to reflect the total barrels 
produced in that month.
    (d) Responsibility for payment of fee--(1) In general. Form 6009, 
Quarterly Report of Fees Due, must be filed and the fee must be paid 
either by the owner of the oil (Sec. 301.9001-1(a)(2)) or by a person 
authorized to act for the owner of the oil under an acceptable power of 
attorney filed with the Austin Service Center. For the purposes of the 
regulations at Secs. 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, and 301.9001-3, an 
operating agreement between the operator of the oil-producing facility 
and the owner of oil is considered an acceptable power of attorney if 
the operating agreement specifically states that the operator is 
authorized to pay the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978.
    (2) Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. W, X, Y, and Z are oil companies that own equal interests 
in oil produced on the Outer Continental Shelf. W was selected to be the 
operator of the offshore facility. Additionally, X, Y, and Z authorized 
W to file Form 6009 and to pay the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the 
Act on the oil produced at this facility. Pursuant to this 
authorization, W paid a fee of $16,600. Since the ownership of the oil 
is divided equally among W, X, Y, and Z, each company's share of the fee 
is $4,150.

    (e) Penalty and Interest. Failure to collect or pay the fee shall 
result in a civil penalty assessed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The 
amount of the penalty is not to exceed $10,000 in addition to the fee 
and the interest on the unpaid fee that would have been earned

[[Page 573]]

if paid when due and invested in the special Treasury securities which 
are to be purchased by the fund. The computation of the rate of interest 
to be levied on underpayment of fees shall be based on the average 
interest rate earned by the interest-bearing special obligations of the 
United States in the fund for each calendar quarter for which there is 
underpayment. Unless it can be shown that the failure to collect or pay 
the fee is due to reasonable cause and not due to the willful neglect, 
the amount of the penalty is the lesser of--
    (1) $10,000 or
    (2) The amount of the fee.

Sec. 301.9100-1  Extension of time for making certain elections.

    (a) In general. The Commissioner in his discretion may, upon good 
cause shown, grant a reasonable extension of the time fixed by 
regulations or by a revenue ruling, a revenue procedure, a notice, or an 
announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin for the making 
of an election or application for relief in respect of tax under all 
subtitles of the Internal Revenue Code except subtitles E, G, H, and I, 
provided--
    (1) The time for making such election or application is not 
expressly prescribed by statute;
    (2) Request for the extension is filed with the Commissioner before 
the time fixed for making such election or application, or within such 
time thereafter as the Commissioner may consider reasonable under the 
circumstances; and
    (3) It is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the 
granting of the extension will not jeopardize the interests of the 
Government. For purposes of this section, an application for an 
extension of time for filing a return under section 6081 is not an 
application for relief in respect of tax.
    (b) Special transitional rule for section 4980A(f)(5) elections. 
Taxpayers may request relief under this paragraph (b) for section 
4980A(f)(5) elections for any year as to which the period of limitations 
has not expired. Requests for relief must be filed with the Commissioner 
by October 2, 1991. In addition to satisfying all other requirements for 
relief, a taxpayer must demonstrate clear evidence of intent to make the 
election at the time it was required to be made.
    (c) Exceptions applicable to elections required to be made prior to 
November 20, 1970. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section, the time fixed by the regulations in subtitle A shall not 
be extended in cases of the

[[Page 574]]

following types of elections and applications required by such 
regulations to be made prior to November 20, 1970:
    (1) An election required to be made in or with the taxpayer's 
original income tax return;
    (2) An election required to be exercised by the filing of a claim 
for credit or refund, unless the election is required to be exercised on 
or before a date which precedes the date of expiration of the period of 
limitations provided in section 6511;
    (3) An election required to be filed in a petition to the Tax Court;
    (4) An application for permission to change a previous election;
    (5) An application for permission to change an accounting method as 
described in Secs. 1.77-1 and 1.446-1;
    (6) An application for permission to change an accounting period as 
described in Sec. 1.442-1; or
    (7) An application for permission to change the method of treating 
bad debts as described in Sec. 1.166-1.

<R05>
Sec. 301.9100-1T  Extensions of time to make elections (temporary).

    (a)-(c) [Reserved]
    (d) Introduction. The regulations under this section and 
Secs. 301.9100-2T through 301.9100-3T provide the standards the 
Commissioner will use to determine whether to grant an extension of time 
to make a regulatory election. The regulations under this section and 
Secs. 301.9100-2T through 301.9100-3T also provide an automatic 
extension of time to make certain statutory elections. An extension of 
time is available for elections that a taxpayer is otherwise eligible to 
make and the granting of an extension of time is not a determination 
that the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make the election. Section 
301.9100-2T provides automatic extensions of time for making regulatory 
and statutory elections when the deadline for making the election is the 
due date of the return or the due date of the return including 
extensions. Section 301.9100-3T provides extensions of time for making 
regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of Sec. 301.9100-
2T.
    (e) Terms. The following terms have the meanings provided below:
    Election includes an application for relief in respect of tax; a 
request to adopt, change, or retain an accounting method or accounting 
period; but does not include an application for an extension of time for 
filing a return under section 6081.
    Regulatory election means an election whose deadline is prescribed 
by a regulation published in the Federal Register, or a revenue ruling, 
revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal 
Revenue Bulletin.
    Statutory election means an election whose deadline is prescribed by 
statute.
    Taxpayer means any person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1).
    (f) General standards for relief. The Commissioner in the 
Commissioner's discretion may grant a reasonable extension of time to 
make a regulatory election, or a statutory election (but no more than 6 
months except in the case of a taxpayer who is abroad), under all 
subtitles of the Internal Revenue Code except subtitles E, G, H, and I, 
provided the taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Commissioner that----
    (1) The taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith; and
    (2) Granting relief will not prejudice the interests of the 
government.
    (g) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of 
this section, an extension of time will not be granted--
    (1) For elections under section 4980A(f)(5);
    (2) For elections required to be made prior to November 20, 1970, in 
the case of an election----
    (i) Required to be made in or with the taxpayer's original income 
tax return;
    (ii) Required to be exercised by filing a claim for credit or 
refund, unless the election is required to be exercised on or before a 
date that precedes the date of expiration of the period of limitations 
provided in section 6511;
    (iii) Required to be filed in a petition to the Tax Court;
    (iv) To change a previous election;

[[Page 575]]

    (v) To change an accounting method as described in Secs. 1.77-1 of 
this chapter and 1.446-1 of this chapter;
    (vi) To change an accounting period as described in Sec. 1.442-1 of 
this chapter; or
    (vii) To change the method of treating bad debts as described in 
Sec. 1.166-1 of this chapter; or
    (3) For elections that are expressly excepted from relief or where 
alternative relief is provided by a statute, a regulation published in 
the Federal Register, or a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or 
announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
    (h) Effective dates. In general, this section and Secs. 301.9100-2T 
through 301.9100-3T are effective for all requests for relief being 
considered by the IRS on June 27, 1996 and for all requests for relief 
submitted on or after June 27, 1996. However, the automatic 12-month 
extension and the automatic 6-month extension provided in Sec. 301.9100-
2T are effective for elections whose due dates are on or after June 27, 
1996.

[T.D. 8680, 61 FR 33367, June 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 301.9100-2T  Automatic extensions (temporary).

    (a) Automatic 12-month extension--(1) In general. An automatic 
extension of 12 months from the original deadline for making a 
regulatory election is granted to make elections described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section provided the taxpayer takes corrective action as 
defined in paragraph (c) of this section within that 12-month extension 
period.
    (2) Elections eligible for automatic 12-month extension. The 
following regulatory elections are eligible for the automatic 12-month 
extension described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section----
    (i) The election to use other than the required taxable year under 
section 444;
    (ii) The election to use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory 
method under section 472;
    (iii) The 15-month rule for filing an exemption application for a 
section 501(c)(9), 501(c)(17), or 501(c)(20) organization under section 
505;
    (iv) The 15-month rule for filing an exemption application for a 
section 501(c)(3) organization under section 508;
    (v) The election to be treated as a homeowners association under 
section 528;
    (vi) The election to adjust basis on partnership transfers and 
distributions under section 754;
    (vii) The estate tax election to specially value qualified real 
property (where the IRS has not yet begun an examination of the filed 
return) under section 2032A(d)(1);
    (viii) The chapter 14 gift tax election to treat a qualified payment 
right as other than a qualified payment under section 2701(c)(3)(C)(i); 
and
    (ix) The chapter 14 gift tax election to treat any distribution 
right as a qualified payment under section 2701(c)(3)(C)(ii).
    (b) Automatic 6-month extension. An automatic extension of 6 months 
from the due date of a return excluding extensions is granted to make 
regulatory or statutory elections whose deadlines are prescribed as the 
due date of the return or the due date of the return including 
extensions in the case of a taxpayer that timely filed its return for 
the year the election should have been made, provided the taxpayer takes 
corrective action as defined in paragraph (c) of this section within 
that 6-month extension period. This extension does not apply, however, 
to regulatory or statutory elections that must be made by the due date 
of the return excluding extensions.
    (c) Corrective action. For purposes of this section, corrective 
action means filing an original or an amended return for the year the 
regulatory or statutory election should have been made and attaching the 
appropriate form or statement for making the election. For those 
elections not required to be filed with a return, corrective action 
means taking the steps required to file the election in accordance with 
the statute, the regulation published in the Federal Register, or the 
revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in 
the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Taxpayers who make

[[Page 576]]

an election under an automatic extension (and all taxpayers whose tax 
liability would be affected by the election) must report their income in 
a manner that is consistent with the election and comply with all other 
requirements for making the election for the year the election should 
have been made and for all affected years; otherwise, the Service may 
invalidate the election.
    (d) Procedural requirements. Any return, statement of election, or 
other form of filing that must be made to obtain an automatic extension 
must provide the following statement at the top of the document: ``FILED 
PURSUANT TO Sec. 301.9100-2T''. Any filing made to obtain an automatic 
extension must be sent to the same address that the filing to make the 
election would have been sent had the filing been timely made. No 
request for a letter ruling is required to obtain an automatic 
extension. Accordingly, user fees do not apply to taxpayers taking 
corrective action to obtain an automatic extension.
    (e) The following example illustrates the rules of this section:

    Example. Taxpayer A fails to make a certain election when filing A's 
1996 income tax return on March 17, 1997, the due date of the return. 
This election does not affect the tax liability of any other taxpayer. 
The applicable regulation requires that the election be made by 
attaching the appropriate form to a timely filed return including 
extensions. In accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, A 
may make the regulatory election by filing an amended return with the 
appropriate form by September 15, 1997 (6 months from the March 17, 
1997, due date).

[T.D. 8680, 61 FR 33368, June 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 301.9100-3T  Other extensions (temporary).

    (a) In general. Requests for extensions of time for regulatory 
elections that do not meet the requirements of Sec. 301.9100-2T must be 
made under the rules of this section. Requests for relief subject to 
this section will be granted when the taxpayer provides the evidence 
(including affidavits described in paragraph (e) of this section) to 
establish that the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and 
granting relief will not prejudice the interests of the government.
    (b) Reasonable action and good faith--(1) In general. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, a 
taxpayer is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith if the 
taxpayer--
    (i) Requests relief under this section before the failure to make 
the regulatory election is discovered by the IRS;
    (ii) Inadvertently failed to make the election because of 
intervening events beyond the taxpayer's control;
    (iii) Failed to make the election because, after exercising 
reasonable diligence (taking into account the taxpayer's experience and 
the complexity of the return or issue), the taxpayer was unaware of the 
necessity for the election;
    (iv) Reasonably relied on the written advice of the IRS; or
    (v) Reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional, including a 
tax professional employed by the taxpayer, and the tax professional 
failed to make, or advise the taxpayer to make, the election.
    (2) Reasonable reliance on a qualified tax professional. For 
purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer will not be considered to 
have reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional if the taxpayer 
knew or should have known that the professional was not--
    (i) Competent to render advice on the regulatory election; or
    (ii) Aware of all relevant facts.
    (3) Taxpayer deemed to have not acted reasonably or in good faith. 
For purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer is deemed to have not 
acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer--
    (i) Seeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related 
penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662 at the time the 
taxpayer requests relief (taking into account any qualified amended 
return filed within the meaning of Sec. 1.6664-2(c)(3) of this chapter) 
and the new position requires or permits a regulatory election for which 
relief is requested;
    (ii) Was fully informed of the required election and related tax 
consequences, but chose not to file the election; or
    (iii) Uses hindsight in requesting relief. If specific facts have 
changed since

[[Page 577]]

the original deadline for making the election that make the election 
advantageous to a taxpayer, the IRS will not ordinarily grant relief. In 
such a case, the IRS will grant relief only when the taxpayer provides 
strong proof that the taxpayer's decision to seek relief did not involve 
hindsight.
    (c) Prejudice to the interests of the government--(1) In general--
(i) Lower tax liability. The interests of the government are prejudiced 
if granting relief would result in a taxpayer having a lower tax 
liability in the aggregate for all years to which the regulatory 
election applies than the taxpayer would have had if the election had 
been timely made (taking into account the time value of money). 
Similarly, if the tax consequences of more than one taxpayer are 
affected by the election, the government's interests are prejudiced if 
extending the time for making the election may result in the affected 
taxpayers, in the aggregate, having a lower tax liability than if the 
election had been timely made.
    (ii) Closed years. The interests of the government are ordinarily 
prejudiced if the tax year in which the regulatory election should have 
been made or any tax years that would have been affected by the election 
had it been timely made are closed by the period of limitations on 
assessment under section 6501(a) before the taxpayer's receipt of a 
ruling granting relief under this section. The IRS may condition a grant 
of relief on the taxpayer providing the IRS with a statement from an 
independent auditor (other than an auditor providing an affidavit 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section) certifying that the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are satisfied.
    (2) Special rules for accounting method regulatory elections. The 
interests of the government are deemed to be prejudiced except in 
unusual and compelling circumstances if the accounting method regulatory 
election is--
    (i) Subject to the procedure described in Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(i) of 
this chapter (requiring the advance written consent of the 
Commissioner), and the request for relief under this section is filed 
more than 90 days after the deadline for filing the Form 3115, 
Application for Change in Accounting Method;
    (ii) Not an election described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section and requires an adjustment under section 481(a) (or would 
require an adjustment under section 481(a) if the taxpayer changed to 
the method of accounting for which relief is requested in a taxable year 
subsequent to the taxable year the election should have been made);
    (iii) Not an election described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section, the taxpayer is under examination and requests relief under 
this section to change from an impermissible method of accounting, and 
granting relief will provide the taxpayer a more favorable method of 
accounting or more favorable terms and conditions than the taxpayer 
would receive if the change from the impermissible method is made as 
part of the examination; or
    (iv) Not an election described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section and the election provides a more favorable method of accounting 
or more favorable terms and conditions if the election is made by a 
certain date or taxable year.
    (3) Special rules for accounting period regulatory elections. The 
interests of the government are deemed to be prejudiced except in 
unusual and compelling circumstances if an election is an accounting 
period regulatory election (other than the election to use other than 
the required taxable year under section 444) and the request for relief 
is filed more than 90 days after the deadline for filing the Form 1128, 
Application to Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year (or other required 
statement).
    (d) Effect of amended returns--(1) Second examination under section 
7605(b). Taxpayers requesting and receiving an extension of time under 
this section waive any objections to a second examination under section 
7605(b) for the issue(s) that is the subject of the relief request and 
any correlative adjustments.
    (2) Suspension of the period of limitations under section 6501(a). A 
request for relief under this section does not suspend the period of 
limitations on assessment under section 6501(a). Thus, for relief to be 
granted, the IRS may require the taxpayer to consent under section 
6501(c)(4) to an extension of the

[[Page 578]]

period of limitations on assessment for the tax year in which the 
regulatory election should have been made and any tax years that would 
have been affected by the election had it been timely made.
    (e) Procedural requirements--(1) In general. Requests for relief 
under this section must provide evidence that satisfies the requirements 
in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and must provide additional 
information as required by this paragraph (e).
    (2) Affidavit and declaration from taxpayer. The taxpayer, or the 
individual who acts on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to tax 
matters, must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led 
to the failure to make a valid regulatory election and to the discovery 
of the failure. When the taxpayer relied on a qualified tax professional 
for advice, the taxpayer's affidavit must describe the engagement and 
responsibilities of the professional as well as the extent to which the 
taxpayer relied on the professional. The affidavit must be accompanied 
by a dated declaration, signed by the taxpayer, which states: ``Under 
penalties of perjury, I declare that, to the best of my knowledge and 
belief, the facts presented herein are true, correct, and complete.'' 
The individual who signs for an entity must have personal knowledge of 
the facts and circumstances at issue.
    (3) Affidavits and declarations from other parties. The taxpayer 
must submit detailed affidavits from the individuals having knowledge or 
information about the events that led to the failure to make a valid 
regulatory election and to the discovery of the failure. These 
individuals must include the taxpayer's income tax return preparer, any 
individual (including an employee of the taxpayer) who made a 
substantial contribution to the preparation of the return, and any 
accountant or attorney, knowledgeable in tax matters, who advised the 
taxpayer with regard to the election. An affidavit must describe the 
engagement and responsibilities of the individual as well as the advice 
that the individual provided to the taxpayer. Each affidavit must 
include the name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of 
the individual, and be accompanied by a dated declaration, signed by the 
individual, which states: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that, 
to the best of my knowledge and belief, the facts presented herein are 
true, correct, and complete.''
    (4) Other Information. The request for relief filed under this 
section must also contain the following information--
    (i) The taxpayer must state whether the taxpayer's return(s) for the 
tax year in which the regulatory election should have been made or any 
tax years that would have been affected by the election had it been 
timely made is being examined by a district director, or is being 
considered by an appeals office or a federal court. The taxpayer must 
notify the IRS office considering the request for relief if the IRS 
starts an examination of any such return while the taxpayer's request 
for relief is pending;
    (ii) The taxpayer must state when the applicable return, form, or 
statement used to make the election was required to be filed and when it 
was actually filed;
    (iii) The taxpayer must submit a copy of any documents that refer to 
the election;
    (iv) When requested, the taxpayer must submit a copy of the 
taxpayer's income tax return for any taxable year for which the taxpayer 
requests an extension and any return affected by the election; and
    (v) When applicable, the taxpayer must submit a copy of the income 
tax returns of other taxpayers affected by the election.
    (5) Filing instructions. A request for relief under this section is 
a request for a letter ruling. Requests for relief should be submitted 
in accordance with the applicable procedures for requests for a letter 
ruling and must be accompanied by the applicable user fee.
    (f) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of 
this section:

    Example 1. Taxpayer discovers own error. Taxpayer A prepares A's 
1996 income tax return. A is unaware that a particular regulatory 
election is available to report a transaction in a particular manner. A 
files the 1996 return without making the election and

[[Page 579]]

reporting the transaction in a different manner. In 1998, A hires a 
qualified tax professional to prepare A's 1998 return. The professional 
discovers that A did not make the election. A promptly files for relief 
in accordance with this section. Assuming paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through 
(iii) of this section do not apply, A is deemed to have acted reasonably 
and in good faith.
    Example 2. Reliance on qualified tax professional. Taxpayer B hires 
a qualified tax professional to advise B on preparing B's 1996 income 
tax return and provides the professional with all the information 
requested. The professional fails to advise B that a regulatory election 
is necessary in order for B to report income on B's 1996 return in a 
particular manner. Nevertheless, B reports this income in a manner that 
is consistent with having made the election. In 1999, during the 
examination of the 1996 return by the IRS, the examining agent discovers 
that the election has not been filed. B promptly files for relief in 
accordance with this section, including attaching an affidavit from B's 
professional stating that the professional failed to advise B that the 
election was necessary. Assuming paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of 
this section do not apply, B is deemed to have acted reasonably and in 
good faith.
    Example 3. Accuracy-related penalty. Taxpayer C reports income on 
its 1996 income tax return in a manner that contravenes a statutory 
provision. C was aware of the statutory provision that prohibited the 
manner in which C reported this income, but did not provide adequate 
disclosure of the return position within the meaning of Sec. 1.6662-3(c) 
of this chapter. In 1999, during the examination of the 1996 return, the 
IRS raises an issue regarding the reporting of this income on C's 
return. C requests relief under this section to elect an alternative 
method of reporting the income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
section, C is deemed to have not acted reasonably and in good faith 
because C seeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related 
penalty could be imposed under section 6662.
    Example 4. Election not requiring adjustment under section 481(a). 
Taxpayer D prepares D's 1996 income tax return. D is unaware that a 
particular accounting method regulatory election is available. D files 
the 1996 return using another method of accounting. In 1998, D hires a 
qualified tax professional to prepare D's 1998 return. The professional 
discovers that D did not make the election. D promptly files for relief 
in accordance with this section. Assume the applicable regulation 
provides that the election does not require an adjustment under section 
481(a) and the election is not subject to the procedure described in 
Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(i) of this chapter. Further assume that if D were 
granted an extension of time to make the election, D would pay no less 
tax than if the election had been timely made. Under paragraph (c) of 
this section, the interests of the government are not deemed to be 
prejudiced.
    Example 5. Election requiring adjustment under section 481(a). The 
facts are the same as in Example 4 of this paragraph (f) except that the 
applicable regulation provides that the election requires an adjustment 
under section 481(a). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
interests of the government are deemed to be prejudiced except in 
unusual or compelling circumstances.
    Example 6. Under examination. A regulation permits an automatic 
change from an impermissible method of accounting on a cut-off basis. 
Any change to this method made as part of an examination is made with a 
section 481(a) adjustment. Taxpayer E reports income on E's 1996 income 
tax return using the impermissible method of accounting. In 1999, during 
the examination of the 1996 return by the IRS, the examining agent 
questions the propriety of E's method of accounting. E requests relief 
under this section to make the change pursuant to the regulation for 
1996. E will receive less favorable terms and conditions if the change 
in method of accounting is made with a section 481(a) adjustment by the 
examining agent than if the change is made on a cut-off basis pursuant 
to the regulation. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the 
interests of the government are deemed to be prejudiced except in 
unusual and compelling circumstances.

section 1371(e)(1)(A) of the Code is available for taxable years

filed), and
    (4) Provides all information necessary to show that the beneficiary

provided in section 1372(a) to be treated as an electing small business 
corporation.
    (e) Election to have Code section 422A apply to options granted 
before 1981. This paragraph applies to the election provided under 
section 251(c)(1)(B) of the Act to have Code section 422A apply to 
certain options granted before 1981. A corporation may make only one 
election under this provision. Thus, a corporation that makes an 
election under this provision with respect to certain options granted 
before 1981 may not make any subsequent election under this provision 
with respect to other options granted before 1981. An election under 
this provision shall be made no later than the due date (taking 
extensions into account) of the income tax return of the corporation for 
its first taxable year during which either an option subject to the 
election or an option subject to the rules of section 422A of the Code 
is exercised. In any event, no election under this provision will be 
permitted after the due date (taking extensions into account) of the 
income tax return for the taxable year including December 31, 1982. A 
corporation shall make this election by attaching

[[Page 582]]

to its income tax return (or amended return) a statement that--
    (1) Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number 
of the corporation,
    (2) Identifies the election as an election under section 
251(c)(1)(B) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,
    (3) Specifies the options to which the election applies, and
    (4) Provides all information necessary to show that the corporation 
is entitled to make the election.
    (f) Election to increase basis of property on which additional 
estate tax is imposed. This paragraph applies to the election provided 
under section 1016(c) of the Code, as amended by section 421(g) of the 
Act. The election to increase the basis of property on which additional 
estate tax is imposed is available with respect to the estates of 
decedents dying after 1981. The qualified heir shall make this election 
by filing with the Form 706-A (Additional Estate Tax Return) a statement 
that--
    (1) Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number 
of the qualified heir and of the estate,
    (2) Identifies the election as an election under section 1016(c) of 
the Code,
    (3) Specifies the property with respect to which the election is 
made, and
    (4) Provides any additional information required by the instructions 
accompanying Form 706-A.

A qualified heir making an election under this paragraph must pay 
interest on the additional estate tax from the date that is 9 months 
after the date of the decedent's death to the date of the payment of the 
additional estate tax.
    (g) Revocation of elections. Elections under paragraph (f) of this 
section are irrevocable. Other elections made under this section may be 
revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. An application for 
consent to revoke an election shall be signed by the applicant and filed 
with the service center with which the election was filed and shall--
    (1) Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of 
all parties identified in connection with the election,
    (2) Identify the election being revoked by reference to the section 
of the Code or Act under which the election was made,
    (3) Specify the scope of the election, and
    (4) Explain why the applicant seeks to revoke the election.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Time for making elections--(i) In general. Except as otherwise 
provided in this paragraph (b)(2), the elections specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall be made by the later of--
    (A) The due date (taking extensions into account) of the tax return 
for the first taxable year for which the election is to be effective, or
    (B) April 15, 1985 (in which case the election generally must be 
made by amended return).
    (ii) No extension of time for payment. Payments of tax due shall be 
made in accordance with Chapter 62 of the Code.
    (iii) Time for making certain life insurance company elections--(A) 
Election to use preceding year's interest rate for non-annuity reserves. 
The election under section 807(d)(4)(C) to use the preceding year's 
interest rate for non-annuity reserves applies on a contract-by-contract 
basis. For contracts issued before the first day of the first taxable 
year beginning after December 31, 1983, the election shall be made by 
the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return for the 
first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1983. For contracts 
issued on or after the first day of the first taxable year beginning 
after December 31, 1983, the election shall be made by the due date 
(including extensions) of the income tax return for the taxable year in 
which the contract is issued.
    (B) Election not to have reserves recomputed. The election under 
section 216(c)(1) of the Act not to have reserves recomputed shall be 
made by the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return for 
the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1983.
    (C) Election to use adjusted statutory reserves for certain 
contracts. The election under section 216(c)(2) of the Act to use 
adjusted statutory reserves for certain contracts may be made only by 
life insurance companies that make an election under section 216(c)(1) 
of the Act and that meet the other requirements of section 216(c)(2). 
The election, if made, applies to all contracts issued on or after the 
first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1983, 
and before January 1, 1989. The election shall be made by the due date 
(including extensions) of the income tax return for the first taxable 
year beginning after December 31, 1983.
    (D) Election to treat individual non-cancellable accident and health 
contracts as cancellable. The election under section 217(i) of the Act 
to treat individual non-cancellable accident and health contracts as 
cancellable shall be made by the due date (including extensions) of the 
income tax return for the first taxable year beginning after December 
31, 1983.
    (E) Treatment of losses from certain guaranteed interest contracts.  
The election under section 217(l)(2)(B) of the

[[Page 586]]

Act with respect to the treatment of losses from certain guaranteed 
interest contracts shall be made by the due date (including extensions) 
of the income tax return for the first taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 1983.
    (iv) Time for making the election to exclude from gross income 
payments received from the U.S. Forest Service as a result of the 
restriction of motorized traffic in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. 
Elections under section 1078 of the Act shall be made by the later of 
the expiration of the period for making a claim for credit or refund of 
the tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year in which 
the reinvestment of the payment occurred, or July 18, 1985. Amended 
returns for years after the year for which the election is made must be 
filed if making this election affects the tax liability for such years.
    (3) Manner of making elections--(i) In general. The elections 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be made by attaching 
a statement to the tax return for the taxable year in which the election 
is made. If because of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) the election may be filed 
after the due date of the tax return for the first taxable year for 
which the election is to be effective, such election must be attached to 
a tax return or amended return for the taxable year to which the 
election relates. Except as otherwise provided in the return or in the 
instructions accompanying the return for the taxable year, the statement 
shall--
    (A) Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of 
the electing taxpayer,
    (B) Identify the election,
    (C) Indicate the section of the Code (or, if the provision is not 
codified, the section of the Act) under which the election is made,
    (D) Specify, as applicable, the period for which the election is 
being made and/or the property or other items to which the election is 
to apply, and
    (E) Provide any information required by the relevant statutory 
provisions and any information necessary to show that the taxpayer is 
entitled to make the election.
    (ii) Special rules for making the election with respect to sound 
recordings. The election under section 48(r), as amended by section 113 
of the Act, shall be made separately for each sound recording and must 
be made by all persons having an ownership interest in the sound 
recording. In the case of an ownership interest held by a partnership or 
an S corporation, the partnership or S corporation shall make the 
election. Each person making the election shall do so in accordance with 
paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section, and shall identify in the 
statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section the persons with 
ownership interests in the sound recording, and shall state that each 
such person is making the election with respect to that sound recording.
    (iii) Special rules for making the election with respect to 
redemption through use of related corporations. For either election 
available under section 712(l)(7) of the Act (relating to redemptions 
through related corporations) to be effective, such election must be 
made jointly by both the issuing and acquiring corporations. The 
election is made jointly when both the issuing and acquiring 
corporations make the election in accordance with paragraph (a) (2) and 
(3) of this section.
    (iv) Special rules for making the election for investment tax credit 
at risk rules. The election under section 431(e)(2) of the Act is made 
by filing an amended return for the first taxable year ending after 
February 18, 1981, during which taxable year property, to which the 
amendments made by section 211(f) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 
1981 apply, was placed in service. If that taxable year is a closed 
year, the election is made by filing an amended return for the first 
succeeding open taxable year, but in such event this election can be 
made only if the aggregate amount of the investment tax credit that 
would have been allowable in the closed years had the election been 
effective for those years is greater than or equal to the amount of the 
investment tax credits actually claimed in the closed years. In the case 
of partnerships and S corporations, the election under section 431(e) is 
made, respectively, at the partner or the shareholder level. Any 
election made under section 431(e) shall apply to all property of the 
taxpayer to which the

[[Page 587]]

amendments made by section 211(f) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 
1981 apply. Amended returns must be filed for any year the tax liability 
for which is affected by making this election.
    (v) Special rules for certain elections by life insurance 
companies--(A) Election with respect to loss from operations of member 
of group. Any life insurance company that makes an election under 
section 806(d)(4) must include on the statement described in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section the name, address and taxpayer identification 
number of the members of the controlled group that did not file a 
consolidated return with the life insurance company for the taxable year 
to which the election applies, the amount of loss subject to the 
limitation provided by section 806(d)(4)(B), and a computation showing 
how such amount was derived.
    (B) Election to use preceding year's interest rate for non-annuity 
reserves. If the election under section 807(d)(4)(C) is not made for all 
non-annuity contracts issued by the life insurance company before the 
end of the taxable year in which the election is made, the company must 
reasonably identify, in the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, the contracts or groups of contracts for which the 
election is made. The statement, however, need not specify each 
individual contract for which the election is made.
    (4) Revocation. The elections under Act sections 31(a), 31(g)(16), 
31(f), 113, 211 (Code section 810(b)(3)), 216(c) (1) and (2), 217(l), 
431(e)(2), and 712(l)(7) (B) and (C)(ii) are irrevocable. Elections 
under Act sections 41(a) (Code sections 1282(b)(2) and 1283(c)(2)), 211 
(Code sections 806(d)(4), and 807(d)(4)(C)), 217(i), 1066, and 1078 are 
revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner. A revocation under 
Act section 211 (Code section 807(d)(4)(C)) shall be treated as a change 
in basis of computing reserves that is subject to the adjustment 
provided in section 807(f) of the Code.
    (b) Election of an alternate valuation of an estate. This paragraph 
applies to the election of alternate valuation of the estate of a 
decedent under section 2032(d) of the Code, as amended by section 1024 
of the Act.
    (1) Time and manner of making election. For decedents dying after 
July 18, 1984, the election specified in this paragraph (b) shall be 
made on the estate tax return required to be filed under section 
6018(a). However, no election shall be allowed unless made on a return 
filed within one year of the due date (including extensions) of such 
return. Once a return that fails to make the election is filed, this 
election may not be made on a subsequent return unless the subsequent 
return is filed by the due date (including extensions) of the original 
return.
    (2) Transition rule for decedents dying before July 19, 1984--(i) In 
general. In the case of a decedent dying before July 19, 1984, the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply if:
    (A) The period of limitations for claiming a refund of the tax 
imposed by Chapter 11 of the Code remained open on July 18, 1984,
    (B) The estate of the decedent would have been eligible to elect 
alternate valuation under section 2032 had the decedent died after July 
18, 1984, and
    (C) The executor files a claim for refund before October 17, 1984.
    (ii) Special rule where tax has not been paid. For cases in which 
the estate tax attributable to the failure to make a section 2032 
election on a timely filed return has not been paid, the executor may 
meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section--
    (A) For cases pending in the Tax Court, by requesting the benefits 
of this transition rule either in a motion or other appropriate document 
filed with the Tax Court or by incorporation of such benefits into a 
decision document before October 17, 1984,
    (B) For other cases where the executor filed a return (other than a 
timely filed return) making a section 2032 election, by notifying the 
district director of the office where such return was filed before 
October 17, 1984; and
    (C) Where the executor has not filed an estate tax return making the 
section 2032 election, by filing such an estate tax return and making 
the election thereon before October 17, 1984.
    (iii) Election treated as if made on a timely filed return. In any 
case in which this transition rule applies, the estate shall be treated 
as if it had made a section 2032 election on a timely filed estate tax 
return.

    (c) Church or qualified church-controlled organization's election of 
exemption from social security taxes under chapter 21--(1) In general. 
This paragraph applies to the election under section 3121(w) of the 
Code, as added by section 2603(b) of the Act, by a church or qualified 
church-controlled organization (as defined in section 3121(w)(3)) that 
service performed in the employ of such church or organization shall be 
excluded from employment for purposes of Title II of the Social Security 
Act and Chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any election made under 
section 3121(w) shall apply to all services performed on or after 
January 1, 1984, by employees of such church or organization (whether or 
not they were employees on that date or on the date the election is 
made). Employees of the electing church or organization are subject to 
the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Code (relating to the tax on self-
employment income) as amended by section 2603 (c)(2) and (d)(2) of the 
Act for service performed for such church or organization on or after 
January 1, 1984.
    (2) Time for making the election. Any election under section 3121(w) 
by a church or qualified church-controlled organization for which a 
quarterly employment tax return for the tax imposed under section 3111 
is due (or would be due but for the election) on October 31, 1984, must 
be made on or before October 30, 1984. Any election under section 
3121(w) by a church or organization for which the first quarterly 
employment tax return for the tax imposed under section 3111 is due (or 
would be due but for this election) after October 31, 1984, must be made 
on or before the day before the first date that such tax return would be 
due from the church or organization (disregarding any extension of such 
due date). A purported election filed after the date prescribed in this 
paragraph (c)(2) shall be void.
    (3) Manner of making the election. To make an election under section 
3121(w), a church or qualified church-controlled organization must 
certify that it is opposed for religious reasons to the payment of the 
tax imposed by section 3111 (relating to the employer tax) of the Code. 
The election and certification are made by executing and filing Form 
8274 in accordance with the form and its instructions. The form shall be 
signed by an official authorized to sign tax returns for the church or 
organization. Where tax imposed by section 3111 is reported (or would be 
reported but for this election) with respect to more than one church or 
organization on a single quarterly employment tax return, and the 
election under section 3121(w) is made, then all of the churches and 
organizations covered by the last such return filed before such election 
was made for which the time for making the election has not expired 
shall be covered by the election unless specifically excluded by stating 
such exclusion in the election.
    (4) Refunds of FICA taxes paid. Where a church or qualified church-
controlled organization makes a timely election under section 3121(w), a 
refund, without interest, shall be made to such church or organization 
of any taxes paid under sections 3101 and 3111 with respect to service 
performed after December 31, 1983, covered by the election. However, the 
refund will be made only if the church or organization agrees on its 
claim for the refund to pay to each employee covered by the election the 
portion of the refund attributable to the tax imposed on the wages of 
the employee by section 3101. The employee may not receive any other 
refund of such taxes. The claim for refund shall be made by the church 
or organization by filing Form 843 with the service center where the 
Form 941 on which the taxes subject to refund was filed. Form 843 shall 
be executed in accordance with the form and its instructions, and also 
in accordance with the instructions to Form 8274 that relate to Form 
843.
    (5) Irrevocability of election except by Commissioner. An election 
under section 3121 shall be irrevocable by the electing church or 
organization. The Commissioner, however, shall permanently revoke the 
election if the church or organization fails to furnish the information 
required under section 6051 to the Internal Revenue Service for a period 
of 2 years or more and also fails to furnish such information within 60 
days after a written request therefor is made by the Internal Revenue 
Service.

    (d) Election to issue taxable student loan bonds. This paragraph 
applies to the election by an issuer to issue taxable student loan bonds 
under section 625(c) of the Act. The election is available for 
obligations issued after December 31, 1983, and is made by filing a 
statement and necessary attachments with the Internal Revenue Service 
Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255, prior to the issuance of such taxable 
bonds. The statement shall identify the election as made under section 
625(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and shall contain the name, address 
and taxpayer identification number of the issuer, and the total purchase 
price, face amount and interest rate of the issue, bond issuance costs, 
amounts allocated to reasonably required reserve or replacement funds, 
and the date of issue. The issuer shall attach to the statement of 
election a copy of previous Internal Revenue Service correspondence 
relating to the tax exempt status of the issuing authority and a 
statement containing the total purchase price, face amount, interest 
rate, bond issuance costs, amounts allocated to reasonably required 
reserve or replacement funds, and the date of issuance of outstanding 
tax exempt issues of student loan bonds of the issuer. With respect to 
outstanding tax exempt issues of student loan bonds of the issuer issued 
after December 31, 1982, the issuer may alternatively attach copies of 
the Form 8038 filed with respect to such issues. Each taxable student 
loan bond must state on its face that the interest paid on such bond is 
subject to federal income taxation. An election with respect to an issue 
is irrevocable once made.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Election not to claim the credit for alcohol used as fuel. The 
election under section 40(f) (as added by section 474(k) of the Act) not 
to claim the alcohol fuels credit is available for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1983, and shall be made for the taxable 
year in which such credit is determined by not claiming such credit on 
an original return or amended return at any time before the expiration 
of the 3-year period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for 
filing the return for the taxable year (determined without regard for 
extensions). The election may be revoked within the 3-year period by 
filing an amended return and claiming the credit on the return.
    (g) Protective election to adopt LIFO method--(1) Time for making 
the election. A protective election in connection with the enactment of 
section 95 of the Act to adopt the LIFO method of accounting for 
inventory under section 472 of the Code can only be made for the 
taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after July 18, 1984, and must be 
made on or before the due date (including extensions) of the tax return 
for such taxable year. Once made, the election is irrevocable unless the 
Commissioner authorizes the use of another inventory method (see 
Sec. 1.472-5).
    (2) Manner for making a protective election. The protective election 
is made by completing all line items on a current Form 970 and 
indicating that the election is a protective election filed in 
connection with the enactment of section 95 of the Tax Reform Act of 
1984. The Form 970 must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return 
for the taxable year for which the protective election is made. The LIFO 
method adopted under the protective election must be consistent in all 
respects with the taxpayer's LIFO method used in the taxpayer's most 
recently completed taxable year for which the LIFO method was used. In 
completing the current Form 970, the taxpayer shall specify the method 
of inventory valuation that the taxpayer would have used, the opening 
LIFO inventory for the taxable year for which the protective election is 
made, and the section 481 adjustment that would be required, as if the 
taxpayer were not on the LIFO method for the taxable year immediately 
preceding the taxable year for which the protective election is made.
    (h) Election by an estate or trust to recognize gain or loss on the 
distribution of property (other than cash) to a beneficiary. This 
paragraph applies to the election made by a trust or estate to recognize 
gain or loss on the distribution of property (other than cash) to a 
beneficiary under section 643(d) of the Code as amended by section 81 of 
the Act. The election is available for distributions made after June 1, 
1984, in

[[Page 590]]

taxable years ending after such date. The election must be made by the 
fiduciary who is required to make the return of the estate or trust 
under section 641 and Sec. 1.641(b)-2. The election shall be made by 
such fiduciary on the tax return of the estate or trust for the taxable 
year with respect to which the distribution of property was made and 
must be filed by the due date (including extensions) of such return. 
Until the Form 1041, U.S. Fiduciary Income Tax Return is revised, the 
election should be made by including the gain or loss on the Schedule D 
(or other appropriate schedule, if applicable) of the Form 1041 and 
attaching the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to 
the tax return on which the election is made and including on that 
statement the name and taxpayer identification number of the 
distributee. For distributions made after June 1, 1984, and before July 
18, 1984, the election must be filed by the later of the due date 
(including extentions) of the tax return of the estate or trust for the 
taxable year with respect to which the distribution was made or January 
1, 1985. For those distributions, the fiduciary may make the election in 
the manner described above on a tax return, or amended return, for the 
year with respect to which the distribution was made. An election under 
section 643(d) may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. 
The request for revocation of an election should be made by the 
fiduciary in the form of a ruling request and must contain the 
information required by regulations and revenue procedures pertaining 
thereto.
    (i) Election to treat a stapled foreign entity as a subsidiary. This 
paragraph applies to the election, provided under section 136(c)(6) of 
the Act, to treat a foreign corporation which was a stapled entity with 
a domestic corporation as of June 30, 1983, as being owned (to the 
extent of its stapled interests) by the domestic corporation with which 
it is stapled. This treatment, if so elected, is in lieu of the 
treatment prescribed in section 269B(a)(1) of the Code, as added by the 
Act. This election may be made by the domestic corporation with which 
the foreign entity is stapled. The election may not be made by the 
foreign entity or by shareholders of the domestic corporation. This 
election must be made no later than January 14, 1985, and may be revoked 
only with the consent of the Commissioner. This election shall be 
effective after December 31, 1986. The domestic corporation shall make 
this election by filing with the service center with which the domestic 
corporation files its income tax return a statement that--
    (1) Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number 
of the domestic corporation,
    (2) Identifies the election as made under section 136(c)(6) of the 
Tax Reform Act of 1984, and,
    (3) Identifies the foreign entity and the interests in the foreign 
entity which constitute stapled interests with respect to the stock of 
the domestic corporation, and specifies the date on which those 
interests became stapled interests.

If this election is not made, the foreign corporation (interests in 
which were stapled interests as of June 30, 1983) will be treated as a 
domestic corporation, effective January 1, 1987, under section 
269B(a)(1) of the Code.
    (j) Election to treat certain section 1248 amounts as included in 
gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A). This paragraph applies to the 
elections, provided under section 133(d)(3) of the Act, to treat amounts 
included in the gross income of any person as a dividend by reason of 
section 1248 (a) or (f) after October 9, 1975, and before July 19, 1985, 
as an amount included in the gross income of such person under section 
951(a)(1)(A). The election with respect to transactions to which section 
1248(a) applies may be made by the foreign corporation described in 
section 1248(a) (or its successor in interest). The election with 
respect to transactions to which secton 1248(f) applies may be made by 
the domestic corporation described in section 1248(f)(1) (or its 
successor in interest). Neither election may be made by an affected 
shareholder of any such corporation (unless the shareholder is the 
successor in interest). This election must be made no later than January 
14, 1985, and shall apply with respect to all transactions to which 
section 1248 (a) or (f) applies

[[Page 591]]

that occurred after October 9, 1975, and before July 19, 1984. Once 
made, the election may be revoked only with the consent of the 
Commissioner. A foreign corporation shall make this election by filing 
the statement described in this paragraph with the Internal Revenue 
Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255. A domestic corporation shall 
make this election by filing the statement described in this paragraph 
with the service center with which the domestic corporation files its 
income tax return. In either case, the statement shall--
    (1) Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number 
(if any) of the corporation making the election,
    (2) Identify the election as made under section 133(d)(3) of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1984, and
    (3) Identify all of the transactions (including the date of each 
transaction), shareholders involved in those transactions, and amounts 
to which the election applies.
    (k) Special election for computing investment company taxable 
income. This paragraph applies to the election by a regulated investment 
company provided under section 1071(b) of the Act, which added section 
852(b)(2)(F) to the Code. Under section 852(b)(2)(F), the taxable income 
of a regulated investment company shall be computed without regard to 
section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount 
basis) if the company so elects. The election may be made only for 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978. A regulated investment 
company shall make the election by computing taxable income without 
regard to section 454(b) on its return for the first taxable year for 
which it desires the election to apply and shall attach the statement 
described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the return on which the 
election is made. A regulated investment company shall make the election 
by the time set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Once made, 
the election applies to the first taxable year for which it is made and 
to all subsequent taxable years and cannot be revoked without the 
consent of the Commissioner.
    (l) Election of extension of time for payment of estate tax for 
interests in certain holding companies. An election under section 
6166(b)(8), as added by section 1021(a) of the Act, or under section 
1021(d)(2) of the Act, shall be made by including on the notice of 
election under section 6166 required by Sec. 20.6166-1(b) a statement 
that an election is being made under section 6166(b)(8) or section 
1021(d)(2) of the Act (whichever is applicable) and the facts which 
formed the basis for the executor's conclusion that the estate qualified 
for such election. If a taxpayer makes an election described in this 
paragraph (l), then the special 4-percent interest rate of section 
6601(j) and the 5-year deferral of principal payments of section 
6166(a)(3) are not available. Thus, the first installment of tax is due 
on the date prescribed by section 6151(a) and subsequent installments 
bear interest at the rate determined under section 6621. If the executor 
makes an election described in this paragraph (l) and the notice of 
election under section 6166 fails to state the amount of tax to be paid 
in installments or the number of installments, then the election is 
presumed to be for the maximum amount so payable and for payment thereof 
in 10 equal annual installments, beginning on the date prescribed in 
section 6151(a). The elections described under this paragraph (l) are 
available for estates of decedents dying after July 18, 1984.
    (m) Subchapter S election by commodities dealers and options 
dealers. This paragraph applies to a commodities dealer or options 
dealer referred to in section 102(d)(3) of the Act (relating to the 
election by such a dealer to be an S corporation) whose taxable year is 
the calendar year and that was a small business corporation (as defined 
in section 1361(b) of the Code) as of January 1, 1984. The election by 
such a dealer under section 102(d)(3) of the Act shall be made in the 
manner prescribed by section 1362 and the regulations thereunder, except 
that the election under section 102(d)(3) must be made before October 2, 
1984. In addition to making the election in the manner prescribed under 
such section 1362 and the regulations thereunder, the commodities dealer 
or options dealer must indicate on Form 2553 that the election is made

[[Page 592]]

under section 102(d)(3) of the Act. Although section 102(d)(3) of the 
Act applies to dealers not covered by this paragraph, and such dealers 
may make an election under such section 102(d)(3), guidelines for making 
such an election are not provided in this paragraph and are forthcoming.
    (n) Election with respect to treatment of S termination year. For 
the election provided under section 1362(e)(3), as amended by section 
721(h) of the Act, see Sec. 18.1362-4 of this chapter.
    (o) Election to be an S corporation; certain short taxable years. 
For the election provided under section 1362(b), as amended by section 
721(l) of the Act, see Sec. 18.1362-1(b) of this chapter.
    (p) Election with respect to subchapter S passive investment income 
rules. For the election provided under section 721(i) of the Act which 
amends section 6(b) of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982, see 
Sec. 18.1362-5 of this chapter.
    (q) Election with respect to subchapter S distributions during 
certain post-termination transition periods. For the election provided 
under section 1371(e), as amended by section 721(o) of the Act, see 
Sec. 18.1371-1 of this chapter.
    (r) No elections for closed year. Any election under this section 
which is allowed to be made by filing an amended return may only be made 
if the period for making a claim for refund or credit with respect to 
the taxable year for which such election is to be effective has not 
expired. This paragraph shall not apply to the election under paragraph 
(a)(2)(iv) of this section with respect to the election under section 
1078 of the Act.
    (s) Additional information required. Later regulations or revenue 
procedures issued under provisions of the Code or Act covered by this 
section may require the furnishing of information in addition to that 
which was furnished with the statement of election described herein. In 
such event the later regulations or revenue procedures will provide 
guidance with respect to the furnishing of such additional information.

provided in this section, the elections specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section shall be made by attaching a statement to the tax return 
for the taxable year for which the election is to be effective. If 
because of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section the election may be 
filed after the due date of the tax return for the first taxable year 
for which the election is to be effective, such statement must be 
attached to a tax return or amended return for the taxable year to which 
the election relates. Except as otherwise provided in the return or in 
the instructions accompanying the return for the taxable year, the 
statement shall--
    (A) Contain the name, address and taxpayer identification number of 
the electing taxpayer,
    (B) Identify the election,

[[Page 598]]

and any information necessary to show that the taxpayer is entitled to 
make the election.
    (ii) Special rules for making the transitional rule elections with 
respect to certain tax-exempt controlled entities. The irrevocable 
election under Act sections 201(a) and 1802(a) (Code sections 
168(h)(6)(F)(ii) and 168(j), as in effect before October 22, 1986), 
shall be made by the tax-exempt controlled entity at the time and in the 
manner described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) of this section. A 
copy of the election statement filed by the tax-exempt controlled entity 
shall also be attached to the Federal tax returns (e.g., Form 990 or 
5500) of each of the tax-exempt shareholders or beneficiaries of the 
controlled entity.
    (iii) Special rule for making the election with respect to gain or 
loss from a disposition of property used in a passive activity. The 
election under Act section 501(a) (Code section 469(j)(9)) shall be made 
on the form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for computing the 
taxpayer's passive activity loss and credit for the taxable year in 
which the property is disposed.
    (iv) Special rules for making the election with respect to 
cooperative housing corporations. The election under Act section 644(d) 
(Code section 216(b)(3)(B)(ii)) may be made by a cooperative housing 
corporation with respect to its real estate taxes or interest or both. 
The election is available for any taxable year beginning after December 
31, 1986, if the cooperative housing corporation has, by January 31 of 
the year following the first calendar year that includes any period to 
which the election applies, furnished to each tenant-stockholder during 
that period a written statement showing the amount of the allocation (or 
allocations) under section 216(b)(3)(B)(i) attributable to such tenant-
stockholder's dwelling unit (or units) for that period. Any cooperative 
housing corporation making the election shall do so in accordance with 
paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section and shall identify in the 
statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section whether the 
election is for real estate taxes or interest or both.
    (v) Special rules for making the election with respect to the 
simplified dollar-value LIFO method. The election under Act section 802 
(Code section 474) may be made only if the taxpayer files with the 
taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year as of the close of 
which the method is first to be used a statement of the taxpayer's 
election to use the simplified dollar-value LIFO inventory method. The 
statement shall be on Form 970 pursuant to the instructions to the form 
and to the requirements of the regulations under section 474, or in such 
other manner as may be acceptable to the Commissioner.
    (vi) Special rules for making the election to have section 453C not 
apply to obligations arising from sales of timeshares and unimproved 
residential lots to individuals. The election under Act section 811(a) 
(Code section 453C(e)(4)) to have section 453C not apply to obligations 
arising from sales of timeshares and unimproved residential lots to 
individuals may be made with respect to any obligation, or with respect 
to a class of such obligations. In the case of an election made with 
respect to a class of obligations, such election shall describe the 
class of obligations with such specificity as to make the class readily 
identifiable.
    (vii) Special rules for making certain finance leasing transitional 
rule elections. The election relating to finance leases under Act 
section 1801(a)(1) (Code section 168(i) as in effect before October 22, 
1986) shall be made by the lessor under a lease agreement subject to the 
finance lease rules of section 168(i) of the Code, as in effect before 
October 22, 1986, by noting this election in the books and records 
relating to the lease agreement within 12 months after February 5, 1987.
    (viii) Special rules for making the election relating to the date 
leased property is treated as originally placed in service. The election 
under Act section 1809(e)(2) (Code section 48(b)(2)) must be made 
jointly by the lessee and the lessor. The election is made jointly when 
both the lessee and the lessor make the election in accordance with 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) of this section. In addition to the 
other information required to be provided under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of 
this section, the statement

[[Page 599]]

described therein shall include a copy of the lease agreement and shall 
be signed by both the lessee and the lessor.
    (ix) Special rules for making the election to be treated as a 
resident alien. The election under Act section 1810(l)(4) (Code section 
7701(b)) to be treated as a resident under Code section 7701(b) shall be 
made by an alien individual by attaching a statement to the individual's 
income tax return (Form 1040), for the taxable year for which the 
election is to be in effect (the election year). The alien individual 
may not make this election until such time as he has satisfied the 
substantial presence test of Code section 7701(b)(1)(A)(ii) for the year 
following the election year. If an alien individual has not satisfied 
the substantial presence test for the year following the election year 
as of the due date (without regard to extensions) of the tax return for 
the election year, the alien individual may request an extension of time 
for filing the return until after he has satisfied such test, provided 
that he pays with his extension application the amount of tax he expects 
to owe for the election year, computed as if he were a non-resident 
alien throughout the election year. The statement shall include the name 
and address of the alien individual and contain a signed declaration 
that the election is being made. It must specify--
    (A) That the alien individual was not a resident in the year 
immediately preceding the election year;
    (B) That the alien individual is a resident in the year immediately 
following the election year under the substantial presence test and the 
individual's number of days of presence in the United States during such 
year;
    (C) The date or dates of the alien individual's 31 consecutive day 
period of presence and continuous presence in the United States during 
the election year; and
    (D) The date or dates of absence from the United States during the 
election year that are deemed to be days of presence.
    (x) Special rules for making the election with respect to the 
treatment of the exercise of certain nonqualified stock options. The 
election under Act section 1879(p)(1) (Code section 83(c)(3)) is made by 
filing on Form 1040X a claim for credit or refund of the overpayment of 
tax resulting from the election. In order to satisfy the requirements of 
Sec. 301.6402-2(b)(1) (relating to grounds set forth in claim), the 
claim for credit or refund must set forth)--
    (A) The date on which the option was granted,
    (B) The name of the corporation which granted the option,
    (C) The date on which the stock was transferred pursuant to the 
exercise of the option,
    (D) The fair market value of such stock on December 4, 1973,
    (E) The fair market value on July 1, 1974 of the stock received upon 
the reorganization of the corporation which granted the option, and
    (F) The date on which the taxpayer sold substantially all of the 
stock received in such reorganization. The taxpayer shall file a single 
claim for credit or refund of the entire overpayment of tax resulting 
from the election under Act section 1879(p)(1).

are revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner.
    (iii) Freely revocable election. The election described in this 
section under Act section 311(d)(2) is freely revocable.
    (b) Elections with respect to the low-income housing credit. The 
elections under Act section 252(a) (Code sections 42(f)(1), 42(g)(1), 
42(i)(2), and 42(j)(5)) must be made for the taxable year in which the 
project is placed in service and shall be made in the certification 
required to be filed pursuant to section 42(l)(1).
    (c) Election to have the rules of section 263A (relating to 
capitalization and inclusion in inventory costs of certain expenses) not 
apply to any plant or animal produced in any farming business conducted 
by the electing taxpayer--(1) In general. This paragraph applies to the 
election under Act section 803(a) (Code section 263A(d)(3)) to have the 
rules of section 263A (relating to capitalization and inclusion in 
inventory costs of certain expenses) not apply to any plant or animal 
produced in any farming business conducted by the electing taxpayer. The 
election is available to taxpayers engaged in the business of farming, 
including producers of agricultural crops, livestock, nursery stock, 
sod, trees bearing fruit, nuts or other crops, and ornamental trees (for 
purposes of section 263A, an evergreen tree that is more than 6 years 
old at the time it is severed from the roots shall not be treated as an 
ornamental tree). The election is not available to a corporation, 
partnership, or tax shelter that is required to use the accrual method 
of accounting under section 447 or section 448(a)(3), or farming 
syndicates (as defined in section 464(c)), or with respect to the 
planting, cultivation, maintenance or development of pistachio trees. In 
addition, the election does not apply with respect to costs incurred for 
the planting, cultivation, maintenance or development of any citrus or 
almond grove incurred during the 4-taxable-year period beginning with 
the taxable year in which such grove was planted. If a citrus or almond 
grove is planted in more than one taxable year, the portion of the grove 
planted in one taxable year is treated as a separate grove for this 
purpose.
    (2) Time and manner of making the election. Unless consent is 
obtained from the Commissioner, the election may only be made for the 
taxpayer's first taxable year that begins after December 31, 1986, and 
during which the taxpayer engages in a farming business. The election 
shall be made on the Schedule E, F or other schedule required to be 
attached to the income tax return for the first taxable year for which 
the election is effective. In the case of a partnership or S 
corporation, the election must be made at the partner or shareholder 
level.
    (3) Election treated as if made if certain requirements satisfied. A 
taxpayer eligible to make the election under section 263A(d)(3) shall be 
treated as having made the election if such taxpayer reports income and 
expense, in accordance with the rules under the election on a timely 
filed income tax return.
    (4) Revocation. Once the election is made, it is revocable only with 
the consent of the Commissioner.
    (5) Special rules for treatment of expenses. If the election is 
made, the plant or animal produced is treated as section 1245 property 
and gain is recaptured (treated as ordinary income) in the amount of 
deductions which, but for the election, would have been required to be 
capitalized with respect to the plant or animal. If the taxpayer or a 
related person makes the election, a non-accelerated method of 
depreciation (as defined in section 168(g)(2)) shall be applied to all 
property used predominantly in any farming business of the taxpayer or 
related person and placed in service in any taxable year during which 
the election is in effect. For purposes of this election, related party

[[Page 601]]

means: (i) The members of the taxpayer's family (defined for this 
purpose to include the spouse of the taxpayer and any of his or her 
children who have not reached the age of 18 as of the last day of the 
taxable year); (ii) any corporation (including an S corporation) 50 
percent or more of the value of which is owned directly or indirectly 
(through the application of section 318) by the taxpayer or members of 
the taxpayer's family; (iii) any corporation that is a member of the 
same controlled group (within the meaning of section 1563) as the 
taxpayer; and (iv) any partnership if 50 percent or more of the value of 
the interests in such partnership is owned directly or indirectly 
(through the application of section 318) by the taxpayer or members of 
the taxpayer's family.
    (d) Election with respect to the treatment of net income for the 
short taxable year resulting from a required change in accounting 
period. This paragraph applies to the election under section 
806(e)(2)(C) of the Act. Net income for the short taxable year resulting 
from a required change in accounting period under the provisions of 
section 806 of the Act which is to be included ratably in the partners' 
and S corporation shareholders' income for the first four taxable years 
(including the short taxable year) beginning after December 31, 1986, or 
included entirely in income for the short taxable year at the election 
of the partner or shareholder, shall be taken into account in accordance 
with section 702 (with respect to partners) and section 1366 (with 
respect to S corporation shareholders).
    (e) Election with respect to reducing partnership or S corporation 
income for the short taxable year resulting from a required change in 
accounting period under section 806 of the Act by an unamortized 
adjustment amount existing as of October 22, 1986--(1) In general. This 
paragraph applies to the election described in H.R. Rep. No. 99-841 at 
II-320.
    (2) Partnerships or S corporations that make the election to reduce 
income for the short taxable year by an unamortized adjustment amount 
existing as of October 22, 1986. Where a partnership or S corporation 
elects to reduce its income for the short taxable year required under 
the provisions of section 806 of the Act by the unamortized adjustment 
amount existing as of October 22, 1986, in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section, the income for the short taxable year (reduced by the 
unamortized adjustment amount) may then be subject to the election, 
under section 806(e)(2)(C) of the Act, by partners and S corporation 
shareholders to include all the net income for the short taxable year 
entirely in income for the partners' or shareholders' taxable year with 
or within which the short taxable year ends.
    (3) Partnerships or S corporations that do not make the election to 
reduce income for the short taxable year by an unamortized adjustment 
amount existing as of October 22, 1986. Where a partnership or S 
corporation does not elect to reduce its income for the short taxable 
year created by the provisions of section 806 of the Act by the 
unamortized adjustment amount existing as of October 22, 1986, as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the short taxable year 
required under the provisions of section 806 of the Act shall be 
considered one taxable year for purposes of amortizing the adjustment 
amount under the requirements of Rev. Proc. 72-51, 1972-2 C.B. 832, or 
Rev. Proc. 83-25, 1983-1 C.B. 689. The net income of the partnership or 
S corporation after reduction by the adjustment amount for the short 
taxable year may then be subject to the election under section 
806(e)(2)(C) of the Act by partners or S corporation shareholders to 
include all the net income for the short taxable year entirely in income 
for the partners' or shareholders' taxable year with or within which the 
short taxable year of the partnership or S corporation ends.
    (f) Cross-reference. See Sec. 301.9100-8(d) for rules on both the 
election under section 905(a) of the Act, relating to section 165(l)(1), 
and the related election under section 165(l)(5), added by section 
1009(d) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, 102 
Stat. 3342. An election under section 165(l) is available only to 
qualified individuals and, in general, applies to reasonably estimated 
losses on deposits in an insolvent or bankrupt financial institution.

[[Page 602]]

    (g) Elections with respect to certain bonds. The elections under Act 
section 1301(b) (Code sections 141(b)(9), 142(d)(1), 142(d)(4)(B), 
143(k)(9)(D)(iii), 145(d), and 147(b)(4)(A)) must be made in the bond 
indenture or a related document (as defined in Sec. 1.103-13(b)(8)) on 
or before the date of issue. With respect to obligations issued on or 
before March 9, 1987 these elections must be made on or before March 9, 
1987 and need not be made in the bond indenture or a related document, 
but must be made in writing and retained as part of the issuer's books 
and records.
    (h) Revocation of the election for exemption from social security 
taxes by certain clergy--(1) In general. This paragraph applies to the 
election under Act section 1704(b) to revoke an election under section 
1402(e)(1) of the Code by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed 
minister of a church, a member of a religious order (other than a member 
of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such 
order), or a Christian Science practitioner. Only elections which are 
effective for the taxable year containing October 22, 1986 may be 
revoked under this paragraph.
    (2) Time for revoking the election. The election shall be revoked by 
filing Form 2031 before the date on which the individual becomes 
entitled to benefits under sections 202(a) or 223 of the Social Security 
Act (without regard to sections 202(j)(1) or 223(b) of such Act), and 
not later than the due date of the Federal income tax return (including 
any extension thereof) for the individual's first taxable year beginning 
after October 22, 1986.
    (3) Manner of revoking the election. To revoke an election under 
section 1402(e)(1), the individual shall file Form 2031 in accordance 
with the instructions accompanying that form. The revocation shall be 
made effective, as designated by the individual on the form, either with 
respect to the individual's first taxable year ending on or after 
October 22, 1986, or with respect to the individual's first taxable year 
beginning after October 22, 1986.
    (4) Special rules for payment of self-employment taxes with respect 
to certain taxable years ending on or after October 22, 1986--(i) 
Elections filed after the due date of the Federal income tax return. If 
Form 2031 is filed on or after the due date of the Federal income tax 
return (including any extension thereof) for the individual's first 
taxable year ending on or after October 22, 1986, and the election made 
therein is effective with respect to that taxable year, Form 2031 shall 
be accompanied by an amended Federal income tax return for such taxable 
year together with payment in full of an amount equal to the total of 
the taxes that would have been imposed by section 1401 of the Code with 
respect to all of the individual's income derived in that taxable year 
which would have constituted net earnings from self-employment for 
purposes of chapter 2 of subtitle A of the Code (notwithstanding 
paragraph (4) or (5) of section 1402(c)) but for the exemption under 
section 1402(e)(1).
    (ii) Elections filed before the due date of the Federal income tax 
return. If Form 2031 is filed before the due date of the Federal income 
tax return (including any extension thereof) for the individual's first 
taxable year ending on or after October 22, 1986, and the election is 
effective with respect to that taxable year, payment in full of an 
amount equal to the total of the taxes that would have been imposed by 
section 1401 of the Code with respect to all of the individual's income 
derived in that taxable year which would have constituted net earnings 
from self-employment for purposes of Chapter 2 of Subtitle A of the Code 
(notwithstanding paragraph (4) or (5) of section 1402(c)) but for the 
exemption under section 1402(e)(1) shall be made:
    (A) In the case of Forms 2031 that are filed on or before the date 
on which the individual's Federal income tax return for such first 
taxable year is filed, with the individual's Federal income tax return 
for such taxable year; and
    (B) In the case of Forms 2031 that are filed after the date on which 
the individual's Federal income tax return for such first taxable year 
is filed, with an amended Federal income tax return for that taxable 
year filed on or before the due date for the individual's Federal income 
tax return (including any extension thereof) for such taxable year.
    (iii) Interest on amounts paid after the due date of the Federal 
income tax return.

[[Page 603]]

If any amount of tax imposed by section 1401 for an individual's taxable 
year with respect to which an election under this paragraph (h) is 
effective is paid after the due date of the individual's Federal income 
tax return (without regard to extensions) for such taxable year, 
interest will be assessed on such tax from the due date of such return 
(without regard to extensions) to the date on which such tax is paid.
    (5) Revocability of the revocation of the election. Once having 
filed Form 2031, the individual may not thereafter file an application 
for an exemption under section 1402(e)(1).
    (6) Effective date of this provision. This provision shall apply 
with respect to remuneration received in the taxable years for which the 
individual designates the revocation to be effective, as described in 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and with respect to monthly insurance 
benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act on the basis 
of the wages and self-employment income of any individual for months in 
or after the calendar year in which such individual's application for 
revocation is effective (and lump-sum death payments payable under such 
title on the basis of such wages and self-employment income in the case 
of deaths occurring in or after such calendar year).
    (i) Revocation of the election for exemption from social security 
taxes by certain churches on qualified church-controlled organizations--
(1) In general. This paragraph applies to the election under Act section 
1882 (Code section 3121 (w)(2)) to revoke an election under section 
3121(w) by a church or qualified church-controlled organization (as 
defined in section 3121(w)(3)).
    (2) Time and manner of revoking the election. The revocation 
described in this paragraph (i) shall be made by filing a Form 941 on or 
before the due date for filing Form 941 (without regard to extensions) 
for the first quarter for which the revocation is to be effective, 
accompanied by payment in full of the taxes that would be due for that 
quarter had there been no election under section 3121(w). See 
paragraph(i)(4) of this section for the effective date of revocations 
made under this paragraph (i).
    (3) Revocability of the revocation of the election. Once an election 
under section 3121(w) is revoked under this paragraph (i), a new 
election under section 3121(w) may not be made.
    (4) Effective date of this paragraph. A revocation made under this 
paragraph (i) shall be effective for the quarter of the calendar year 
covered by the Form 941 on which the revocation is made in accordance 
with paragraph (i)(2) of this section and all subsequent quarters. 
However, no revocation shall be effective prior to January 1, 1987 
unless such electing church or church-controlled organization had 
withheld and paid over all employment taxes due, as if such election had 
never been in effect, during the period from the effective date of the 
election being revoked through December 31, 1986.
    (j) Additional information required. Later regulations or revenue 
procedures issued under provisions of the Code or Act covered by this 
section may require the furnishing of information in addition to that 
which was furnished with the statement of election described in this 
section. In such event, the later regulations or revenue procedures will 
provide guidance with respect to the furnishing of such additional 
information.

    (ii) Elections revocable with the consent of the Commissioner. The

sections of the Act are revocable only with the consent of the 
Commissioner: 1006(d)(15), 1006(j)(1)(C), 1006(t)(18)(B), 1009(d) (Code

(Code section 263A(d)(3)(B)), and 6277.
    (iii) Freely revocable elections. The election described in this 
section that is made under section 6011 of the Act is revocable without 
the consent of the Commissioner. (See section 121(c) of the Code and 
Sec. 1.121-4 of the regulations.)
    (b) Elections with respect to the low-income housing credit. The 
elections under sections 42(d)(3)(B), 42(f)(1), 42(g)(3)(B)(i), 
42(i)(2)(B), and 42(j)(5)(B) of the Code generally must be made for the 
taxable year in which the building is placed in service, or the 
succeeding taxable year if the section 42(f)(1) election is made to 
defer the start of the credit period, and must be made in the 
certification required to be filed pursuant to section 42(l) (1) and 
(2), as amended by the Act. The election under section 42(j)(5)(B) of 
the Code must be made by the later of the due date of the certification 
or January 22, 1990. The election under section

[[Page 611]]

42(b)(2)(A)(ii) must be made in accordance with the requirements of 
Notice 89-1, 1989-2 I.R.B. 10.
    (c) Election to treat certain carryovers of disallowed investment 
interest expense as passive activity deductions. The requirements of 
paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section do not apply to an election 
under section 1005(c)(11) of the Act. Instead, the election must be made 
at the time and in the manner prescribed in Notice 89-36, 1989-13 I.R.B. 
6. Thus, the election must be made before the filing deadline specified 
in Notice 89-36 by amending previously filed returns to reflect any 
change in the computation of tax liability that results from the 
election.
    (d) Election with respect to the treatment of reasonably estimated 
losses in an insolvent or bankrupt financial institution--(1) In 
general. This paragraph (d) applies to an election under section 905(a) 
of the 1986 Act, and to an election under section 1009(d) of the Act, 
both relating to section 165(l) of the Code. If--
    (i) As of the close of the taxable year, it can reasonably be 
estimated that there is a loss on a deposit (within the meaning of 
section 165(l)(4)) of a qualified individual (as defined in section 
165(l)(2)) in a qualified financial institution (as defined in section 
165(l)(3)), and
    (ii) Such loss is on account of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such 
institution, then the qualified individual may elect under either 
section 165(l)(1) or (5) (but not both), to treat the amount (subject to 
the applicable limitations if under section 165(l)(5)) so estimated for 
that taxable year as a loss described in either section 165(c)(3), 
relating to casualty losses, or section 165(c)(2), relating to 
transactions entered into for profit, and incurred during the taxable 
year.

The election will apply to all losses of the qualified individual on 
deposits in the institution with respect to which an election is made. 
For additional information and examples of the application of the 
election rules, see Notice 89-28, 1989-12 I.R.B. 72.
    This paragraph (d) includes the procedural and the principal 
substantive rules first issued in Notice 89-28. For specific rules 
relating to an election under section 165(1)(5), see paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) Specific rules relating to the section 165(1)(5) election--(i) 
Applicability. An election under section 165(1)(5) of the Code may be 
made only if no part of the taxpayer's deposits in the financial 
institution is federally insured. Generally, this requirement will be 
met only in cases in which none of the deposits in the financial 
institution are federally insured.
    (ii) Dollar limitations. An election under section 165(1)(5) of the 
Code is limited to $20,000 ($10,000 in the case of a separate return by 
a married individual) in aggregate losses on deposits in any one 
financial institution. The applicable dollar limit must be reduced by 
the amount of any insurance proceeds that can reasonably be expected to 
be received under any state law.
    (3) Time and manner of determining loss and making the election--(i) 
Year of election and determination of loss. A qualified individual may 
make an election under section 165(1) of the Code either for the first 
taxable year in which a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made or 
for a later taxable year that is prior to the taxable year in which the 
loss is sustained. The amount of the loss is determined by the 
difference between a taxpayer's basis in the deposits and the amount 
that is reasonably estimated to be recovered, taking into account all 
facts and circumstances reasonably available to the taxpayer as of the 
date the election is made. A reasonable estimate might be based, for 
example, on the percentage of total deposits likely to be recovered by 
the depositors according to a determination made by the regulatory 
authority or trustee having responsibility over the institution. In 
addition, the taxpayer's basis in the deposits must be reduced to the 
extent that a loss is claimed.
    (ii) Time and manner of making election. A qualified individual may 
make an election under section 165(1) of the Code on--
    (A) The income tax return for the taxable year with respect to which 
the taxpayer made a reasonable estimate of the loss;
    (B) An amended income tax return for a taxable year described in 
paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, if the

[[Page 612]]

period prescribed for filing a claim for refund or credit for that 
taxable year has not yet expired; or, if applicable,
    (C) An amended income tax return for a taxable year (beginning after 
December 31, 1981) described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, 
whether or not the claim for refund or credit is barred by another 
provision of law, but only if the amended return is properly filed on or 
before November 9, 1989.
    (iii) Information to include with election. The election should 
include any information requested in the applicable forms and 
instructions (e.g., Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts). If the applicable 
form(s) and instructions do not make reference to or request information 
concerning this election, the taxpayer should, on an appropriate line or 
space clearly indicate the name of the financial institution, include 
the following language: ``Insolvent Financial Institution Election,'' 
and include the calculation of the reasonably estimated loss claimed.
    (4) Revocability of the election--(i) In general. If a taxpayer 
desires to revoke an election under section 165(l) of the Code, the 
taxpayer must request, in writing, the consent of the Secretary setting 
forth the pertinent facts surrounding the election and the reasons for 
requesting a revocation.
    (ii) Exception. With respect to an election made under section 
165(l)(1) of the Code prior to November 9, 1989, a qualified individual 
may revoke such election without securing the prior consent of the 
Secretary but only if the taxpayer makes an election under section 
165(l)(5) by November 9, 1989, in the manner prescribed in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section.
    (5) Effective date. Paragraph (d) of this section is generally 
effective for elections made under section 165(1) of the Code on or 
after November 10, 1988. However, an election filed prior to February 
24, 1989, that is made in any reasonable manner will be effective.
    (e) Election to treat a survivor annuity payable to a surviving 
spouse as a nondeductible terminable interest. Where the time for making 
the election under section 2056(b)(7)(C)(ii) of the Code to treat the 
survivor annuity as nondeductible otherwise expires before November 11, 
1990, the election may be made before November 11, 1990, by filing with

the last bond that is part of the issue is retired. In addition, while 
the facilities are nongovernmentally owned, any publicly recorded 
document with respect to the facilities must state that neither the

period the bonds are outstanding or within 6 years after the date the

and the taxpayer's basis or entitlement for making the election.
    (e) Effect of election--(1) Consent to revoke required. Except where 
otherwise provided by statute or except as provided in subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph, an election to which this section applies made in

the election is obtained from the Commissioner. An application for 
consent to revoke the election will not be accepted before the 
promulgation of the permanent regulations relating to the section of the

provide a reasonable period of time within which taxpayers will be 
permitted to apply for consent to revoke the election.
    (2) Revocation without consent. An election to which this section 
applies, made in accordance with this section, may be revoked without

Register, provided such regulations grant taxpayers blanket permission 
to revoke that election within such time without the consent of the 
Commissioner. Such blanket permission to revoke an election will be

permanent regulations which are issued under the section of the Code or

section, the taxpayer must furnish such additional information in a 
statement addressed to the district director, or the director of the 
regional service center, with whom the election was filed. This 
statement must clearly identify the election and the taxable year for 
which it was made. If such information is not provided the election may, 
at the discretion of the Commissioner, be held invalid.

Sec. 301.9100-13T  Elections relating to reduction of basis.

    (a) Scope. The regulations prescribed in this section provide rules 
for making elections under sections 108(b)(5), 108(d)(4), and 
1017(b)(3)(E), relating to reduction of basis in connection with 
discharge of indebtedness.
    (b) Availability of elections--(1) Dates relating to discharge of 
indebtedness. The elections are available to certain taxpayers for the 
amount of a discharge of indebtedness that may be excluded from gross 
income under section 108(a), if the discharge occurs after December 31, 
1980, unless the discharge occurs in the following cases or proceedings 
commencing on or before December 31, 1980:
    (i) Any case under title 11 of the United States Code or under the 
Bankruptcy Act and
    (ii) A receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding in a Federal 
or State court, or, if the taxpayer is a financial institution to which 
section 585 or 593 applies, in a Federal or State agency.

For the election to use an earlier effective date in certain 
circumstances see Sec. 7a.3.
    (2) Taxpayers to whom an election is available. The election under 
section 108(b)(5) is available to taxpayers in a title 11 case or 
insolvent taxpayers. See section 108(d) (2) and (3) for the definition 
of the terms ``title 11 case'' and ``insolvent.'' The election under 
section 108(d)(4) is available to taxpayers not in a title 11 case to 
the extent they are not insolvent after the debt is forgiven. The 
election under section 1017(b)(3)(E) is available to taxpayers to whom 
section 1017 applies.
    (c) Effect of elections--(1) Election to apply reduction first 
against depreciable property under section 108(b)(5)--(i) In general. 
Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer may elect 
under section 108(b)(5) to apply any portion of the amount excluded from 
gross income under section 108(a)(1) (A) or (B) (relating to title 11 
cases and insolvency) first to reduce (under the rules of section 1017) 
the basis of depreciable property (as defined in section 1017(b)(3)). 
The remaining amount is applied to reduce the tax attributes listed in 
section 108(b)(2), in the order listed.
    (ii) Transitional rule. If the discharge of indebtedness occurs 
before January 1, 1982, or occurs in a case or proceeding described in 
paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section commencing before January 
1, 1982, and the taxpayer makes the election under section 108(b)(5), 
the taxpayer may apply any portion of the amount excluded from gross 
income under section 108(a)(1) (A) or (B) first to reduce (under the 
rules of section 1017) the basis of depreciable property (as defined in 
section 1017(b)(3)). The remaining amount is applied to reduce basis 
under section 108(b)(2)(D). In the case of a discharge of indebtedness 
covered by this transitional rule, the basis of any property

[[Page 620]]

(depreciable or nondepreciable) cannot be reduced under section 1017 
below the fair market value of the property on the day the debt is 
discharged. (See section 7(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980.)
    (2) Election to treat certain indebtedness as qualified business 
indebtedness under section 108(d)(4). Section 108(a)(1)(C) provides an 
exclusion from gross income of the amount of income attributable to the 
discharge (in whole or in part) of the taxpayer's qualified business 
indebtedness. Indebtedness is qualified business indebtedness of the 
taxpayer only if (i) the indebtedness was incurred or assumed by a 
corporation, or by an individual in connection with property used in the 
individual's trade or business, and (ii) such taxpayer makes the 
election under section 108(d)(4) and this section with respect to the 
indebtedness. Section 108(a)(1)(C) does not apply to a discharge in a 
title 11 case, or to a discharge to the extent that the taxpayer is 
insolvent. If the taxpayer makes the election under this section, the 
amount excluded from gross income is applied to reduce (under the rules 
of section 1017) the basis of the taxpayer's depreciable property (as 
defined in section 1017(b)(3)).
    (3) Election to treat certain inventory as depreciable property 
under section 1017(b)(3)(E). If the amount excluded from gross income 
under section 108 (relating to discharge of indebtedness) is to be 
applied to reduce the basis of depreciable property, then the taxpayer 
may elect to treat all of the taxpayer's real property described in 
section 1221(1) as depreciable property.
    (d) Time and manner--(1) In general. An election under sections 
108(b)(5), 108(d)(4), and 1017(b)(3)(E) must be made with the taxpayer's 
income tax return for the taxable year in which the discharge occurs. 
However, if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the 
Commissioner reasonable cause for failure to file the election with the 
taxpayer's original return, the taxpayer may file the election with an 
amended return or claim for credit or refund. The election must be made 
on a statement attached to a completed Form 982, or on that form itself 
if the form provides a space for the election. The statement must 
contain the following:
    (i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
taxpayer, and
    (ii) A statement that the taxpayer is making the election under 
section 108(b)(5), 108(d)(4), or 1017(b)(3)(E), as the case may be.

Because the regulations under section 1017 have not been amended to 
reflect the provisions of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, a taxpayer 
making an election under this section does not consent, by completing 
Form 982, to application of the regulations contained in 26 CFR 1.1017-1 
and 1.1017-2 (Rev. April 1, 1980).
    (2) Special rule. If the taxpayer's income tax return for the year 
of the discharge has been filed (or is due) before July 6, 1981, the 
taxpayer can make the election with an amended return filed before 
September 3, 1981.
    (e) Revocability of election. An election under section 108(b)(5), 
108(d)(4), or 1017(b)(3)(E) may be revoked only with the consent of the 
Commissioner.

43896, Sept. 23, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 301.9100-14T  Individual's election to terminate taxable year when case commences.

    (a) Scope. The regulations prescribed in this section provide rules 
for making the election under section 1398(d)(2) to terminate the 
taxable year of an individual taxpayer.
    (b) Availability of election. This election is available to an 
individual taxpayer in a case commenced after March 24, 1981, under 
chapter 7 (relating to liquidations) or chapter 11 (relating to 
reorganizations) of title 11 of the United States Code. If the case is 
dismissed, the taxpayer cannot make the election, and an election 
previously made will be void. For purposes of this section, a 
partnership is not treated as an individual. If the taxpayer making the 
election is married (within the meaning of section 143), the election is 
available to the taxpayer's spouse, but only if the spouse is eligible 
to file, and does file, a joint return with the taxpayer for the taxable 
year ended as a result of the election.

[[Page 621]]

    (c) Effect of election. The election terminates the taxable year of 
the taxpayer (and of a spouse who joins in the election) on the day 
before the commencement date of the case. A new taxable year begins on 
the commencement date and (unless terminated earlier) ends on the date 
on which the taxpayer's taxable year in which the case commenced would 
have ended if the election had not been made.
    (d) Time and manner. A taxpayer to whom the election is available 
makes the election by filing a return for the short taxable year ending 
the day before commencement of the case (the ``first short taxable 
year'') on or before the 15th day of the fourth full month following the 
end of that first short taxable year. The spouse of such a taxpayer 
makes the election by making a joint return with the taxpayer for that 
first short taxable year within the time prescribed in the preceding 
sentence. To facilitate processing, the taxpayer should write ``Section 
1398 Election'' at the top of the return. A taxpayer may also make the 
election by attaching a statement of election to an application for 
extension of time for filing a return that satisfies the requirements 
under section 6081 for the first short taxable year. The application for 
extension must be submitted under section 6081 on or before the due date 
of the return for the first short taxable year. The statement must state 
that the taxpayer elects under section 1398(d)(2) to close his or her 
taxable year as of the day before commencement of the case. If the 
taxpayer's spouse elects to close his or her taxable year, the spouse 
must join in the application for extension and in the statement of 
election. If a joint return is not filed for the first short taxable 
year, the election of the spouse made with the application is void.
    (e) Irrevocability of election. The election is irrevocable.
    (f) Subsequent bankruptcy case of debtor's spouse. If a case under 
chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code commences 
with respect to the spouse of a debtor to whom an election under this 
section was available, the spouse can make an election under this 
section even if the spouse's case commences in the same taxable year in 
which the debtor's case commences. The spouse can make the election 
whether or not the spouse previously joined in the debtor's election. If 
the spouse joined in the debtor's election, or if the debtor did not 
make the election, the debtor may join in the spouse's election, 
assuming the debtor is otherwise eligible to file a joint return with 
the spouse.
    (g) Examples.

                                 Example

    (1) Assume that husband and wife are calendar-year taxpayers, that a 
bankruptcy case involving only the husband commences on March 1, 1982, 
and that a bankruptcy case involving only the wife commences on October 
10, 1982.
    (2) If the husband does not make an election, his taxable year would 
not be affected; i.e., it does not terminate on February 28. If the 
husband does make an election, his first short taxable year would be 
January 1 through February 28; his second short taxable year would begin 
March 1. The tax return for his first short taxable year would be due on 
June 15. The wife could join in the husband's election, but only if they 
file a joint return for the taxable year January 1 through February 28.
    (3) The wife could elect to terminate her taxable year on October 9. 
If she did, and if the husband had not made an election or if the wife 
had not joined in the husband's election, she would have two taxable 
years in 1982--the first from January 1 through October 9, and the 
second from October 10 through December 31. The tax return for her first 
short taxable year would be due on February 15, 1983. If the husband had 
not made an election to terminate his taxable year on February 28, the 
husband could join in an election by his wife, but only if they file a 
joint return for the taxable year January 1 through October 9. If the 
husband had made an election but the wife had not joined in the 
husband's election, the husband could not join in an election by the 
wife to terminate her taxable year on October 9, since they could not 
file a joint return for such year.
    (4) If the wife makes the election relating to her own bankruptcy 
case, and had joined the husband in making an election relating to his 
case, she would have two additional taxable years with respect to her 
1982 income and deductions--the second short taxable year would be March 
1 through October 9, and the third short taxable year would be October 
10 through December 31. The husband could join in the wife's election if 
they file a joint return for the second short taxable year. If the 
husband joins in the wife's election, they could file joint returns for 
the

short taxable year ending December 31, but would not be required to do 
so.

Sec. 301.9100-15T  Election to use retroactive effective date.

    (a) Scope. The regulations prescribed in this section provide rules 
for making the election to use a retroactive effective date under 
section 7(f) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980.
    (b) Availability of election. The election is available to the 
debtor (or debtors) in a case under title 11 of the United States Code 
(or a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding in a Federal or 
State court) that commences after September 30, 1979, and before January 
1, 1981. The court must approve the election. For purposes of this 
paragraph (b), a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding before 
a Federal or State agency involving a financial institution to which 
section 585 or 593 applies shall be treated as a proceeding before a 
court.
    (c) Effect of election--(1) In general. An election under this 
section changes the effective date of certain amendments to the Code 
made by the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980. The amendments affected by an 
election under this section are listed in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of 
this section. If the election is made, all of the amendments listed in 
paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section apply to all transactions in 
the case (or similar proceeding) and to all parties in respect of all 
transactions in the case (or similar proceeding). Thus, the debtor may 
not elect to have only certain of the amendments apply to transactions 
in the case (or similar proceeding) and may not elect to have the 
amendments apply only to certain transactions in the case (or similar 
proceeding). An election under this section will not make the amendments 
listed in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) applicable to transactions occurring 
prior to commencement of the case (or similar proceeding) or 
transactions not in the case (or similar proceeding).
    (2) Amendments affected. An election under this section changes the 
effective date of the amendments to the following sections:
    (i) 111, relating to recovery of bad debts, prior taxes, and 
delinquency amounts,
    (ii) 302, relating to the repeal of special treatment for certain 
railroad redemptions,
    (iii) 312, relating to the effect of debt discharge on earnings and 
profits,
    (iv) 337, relating to the application of the 12-month liquidation 
rule,
    (v) 351, relating to certain transfers to controlled corporations,
    (vi) 354 (other than the amendment made by section 6(i)(2) of the 
Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980), 355, 357, 368, and 381, relating to 
corporate reorganizations,
    (vii) 382, relating to special limitations on net operating loss 
carryover,
    (viii) 542, relating to the personal holding company tax, and
    (ix) 703, relating to elections of partnerships.
    (3) Other amendments affected in part. Subject to the transitional 
rule of section 7(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, an election 
under this section changes the effective date of the amendments to 
sections 108 and 1017, relating to the tax treatment of discharge of 
indebtedness.
    (4) Substitution of effective dates. The election under this section 
changes the effective date of the amendments listed in paragraph (c) (2) 
and (3) of this section by substituting ``September 30, 1979'' for 
``December 31 1980'' wherever it appears in section 7(a), (c), and (d) 
of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980.
    (d) Time and manner--(1) Time and place. A debtor makes the election 
under this section by filing the written statement and evidence of court 
approval required under paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this section on or 
before November 2, 1981, with the District Director or the Director of 
the Internal Revenue Service Center with whom an income tax return for 
the debtor would be filed if it were due on the date the election is 
filed. The election shall be considered to be made on the date on which 
the written statement and evidence of court approval is filed. The 
debtor should attach a copy of the statement and evidence of court 
approval to the next income tax return filed on or after the date the 
election is made.

[[Page 623]]

    (2) Statement. The written statement must be signed by the debtor 
(or a person duly authorized to sign the income tax return of the 
debtor) and must contain the following:
    (i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
debtor,
    (ii) A statement that the debtor is making the election under 
section 7(f) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, and
    (iii) Information (including the date of commencement) sufficient to 
identify the bankruptcy case or similar proceeding.
    (3) Evidence of court approval. The evidence of court approval (or 
of approval of an agency in certain proceedings described in paragraph 
(b) of this section) must be a copy of an order or other document 
properly signed by the judge or other presiding officer. In addition to 
information identifying the debtor and the case or proceeding over which 
the officer presides, the order or other document must state that the 
court (or agency, as the case may be) approves the election of the 
debtor under section 7(f) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980.
    (e) Revocability. An election under this section may be revoked only 
with the consent of the Commissioner. A request for revocation can be 
made only with approval of the court (or agency).

Sec. 301.9100-16T   Election to accrue vacation pay.

    (a) In general. Section 463 provides that taxpayers whose taxable 
income is computed under an accrual method of accounting may elect 
without the consent of the Commissioner, to deduct certain amounts with 
respect to vacation pay which, because of contingencies, would not 
otherwise be deductible. Such election must apply to the liability for 
all vacation pay accounts maintained by the taxpayer within a single 
trade or business if the liability is contingent when vacation pay is 
earned.
    (b) Time for making election. (1) In the case of a taxpayer who 
established or maintained a vacation pay account pursuant to I.T. 3956 
and who continued to maintain such account pursuant to section 97 of the 
Technical Amendments Act of 1958, as amended, for its last taxable year 
ending before January 1, 1973, the election must be made for each trade 
or business for which such account was maintained on or before the later 
of (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) the due date for filing the income tax 
return (determined with regard to any extensions of time granted the 
taxpayer for filing such return) for the first taxable year beginning 
after December 31, 1973. The election pursuant to this paragraph shall 
be effective with respect to an account described in this paragraph 
(b)(1) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1972. Failure to file 
such election shall constitute a change in the method of accounting for 
vacation pay for the first taxable year ending after December 31, 1972. 
Such change in accounting method will be considered a change initiated 
by the taxpayer.
    (2) In the case of a trade or business of a taxpayer to which 
paragraph (b)(1) does not apply, the election provided for in this 
section may be made for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1973, by making the election not later than (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) 
the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to 
any extensions of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for 
the first taxable year for which the election is made.
    (3) A taxpayer who elects under section 463 to treat vacation pay as 
provided in this section and who wishes to revoke such election may only 
do so with the consent of the Commissioner. Such revocation shall 
constitute a change in the method of accounting.
    (c) Manner of making election. (1) Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the election provided for in this 
section must be made by means of a statement attached to a timely filed 
income tax return. The statement shall indicate that the taxpayer is 
electing to apply the provisions of section 463, and shall contain the 
following information:
    (i) The taxpayer's name and a description of each vacation pay plan 
to which the election is to apply.
    (ii) A schedule with appropriate explanations showing--

[[Page 624]]

    (A) In the case of a vacation pay account established or maintained 
pursuant to I.T. 3956 and section 97 of the Technical Amendments Act of 
1958, as amended,
    (1) The balance of each such vacation pay account maintained by the 
taxpayer, and
    (2) The amount, determined as if the taxpayer had maintained a 
vacation pay account for the last taxable year ending before January 1, 
1973, representing the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by 
employees, before the close of the taxable year and payable during such 
taxable year or within 12 months following the close of such taxable 
year.
    (B) In the case of other vacation pay accounts, the amount of the 
closing balances the taxpayer would have had for the taxpayer's 3 
taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year for which the 
election was made, had the taxpayer maintained an account representing 
the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by the employees before 
the close of the taxable year and payable during the taxable year or 
within 12 months following the close of the taxable year throughout the 
3 immediately preceding taxable years.
    (iii) The amounts accrued and deducted for prior years for vacation 
pay but not paid at the close of the taxable year preceding the year for 
which the election is made.
    (2) Where a taxpayer has filed its return for a taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1973 prior to July 21, 1975, and has not 
made the election pursuant to this section, the election may be made by 
filing an amended return (showing adjustments, in any) for such year and 
attaching the statement required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section on 
or before July 21, 1975.
    (d) The time for making the election may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example (1). X, whose taxable year begins on February 1, files, its 
return based on the accrual method of accounting. X has continuously 
accrued and deducted for income tax purposes contingent amounts of 
vacation pay, pursuant to I.T. 3956. Pursuant to section 463 and these 
regulations, in order for X to continue accruing and deducting its 
vacation pay amounts, X must elect to account for vacation pay under 
section 463 by attaching the election to its timely filed return for its 
taxable year ending on January 31, 1975, or if X has already filed such 
return by July 21, 1975, without such election, by filing the election 
statement with an amended return by July 21, 1975. If X does not make 
the election under section 463, X will be treated as having initiated a 
change in its method of accounting for vacation pay in its taxable year 
ending on January 31, 1973.
    Example (2). Y, a calendar year taxpayer files its returns based on 
the accrual method of accounting. Y deducted its vacation pay amounts 
only when paid since such amounts were contingent when earned and Y was 
not entitled to the benefits of I.T. 3956, Y may elect for its taxable 
year ending on December 31, 1974, to deduct certain amounts with respect 
to contingent vacation pay which were not otherwise deductible, by 
filing an election pursuant to these regulations with its timely filed 
income tax return for such year or if such return was already filed by 
[insert date 90 days after publication of this document as a Treasury 
decision], without such election, by filing the election with an amended 
return filed by July 21, 1975. If Y does not make the election for its 
taxable year ending on December 31, 1974, Y may make the election with 
respect to any subsequent taxable year by filing an election with its 
return for such year.

    (b) Manner of making election or serving notice--(1) In general. (i) 
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a taxpayer may 
make an election under any section referred to in paragraph (a) (1) or 
(2) of this section for the first taxable year for which the election is 
required to be made or for the taxable year selected by the taxpayer 
when the choice of a taxable year is optional. The election must be made 
not later than (a) the time, including extensions thereof, prescribed by 
law for filing the income tax return for such taxable year or (b) 90 
days after the date on which the regulations in this section are filed 
with the Office of the Federal Register, whichever is later.
    (ii) The election shall be made by a statement attached to the 
return (or an amended return) for the taxable year, indicating the

    (2) Additional time for certain elections. An election under section 
503(c)(2) of the Act or section 642(c)(1) of the Code must be made in

the regulations in this section are filed with the Office of the Federal 
Register shall be made in a statement attached to the taxpayer's income 
tax return for the first taxable year in which expenditures are paid or

district director, or the director of the regional service center, with 
whom the election was filed.
    (ii) The notification referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, in respect of an election under section 615(e) which is made on

as an election under section 617(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of

[[Page 626]]

Sec. 15.1-1 of this chapter with respect to exploration expenditures 
paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, whether or not the taxpayer 
subsequently revokes his election under section 615(e) with respect to 
exploration expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1970.
    (iv) For rules relating to the revocation of an election under 
section 615(e), including such an election which is treated pursuant to 
this subparagraph as an election under section 617(a), see paragraph (a) 
of Sec. 15.1-2 of this chapter (T.D. 6907, C.B. 1967-1, 531, 535).
    (c) Effect of election--(1) Revocations--(i) Consent to revoke 
required. Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, 
an election made in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
shall be binding unless consent to revoke the election is obtained from 
the Commissioner. An application for consent to revoke the election will 
not be accepted before the promulgation of the permanent regulations 
relating to the section of the Code or Act under which the election is 
made. Such regulations will provide a reasonable period of time within 
which taxpayers will be permitted to apply for consent to revoke the 
election.
    (ii) Revocation without consent. An election made in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be revoked without the consent of 
the Commissioner not later than 90 days after the permanent regulations 
relating to the section of the Code or Act under which the election is 
made are filed with the Office of the Federal Register, provided such 
regulations grant taxpayers blanket permission to revoke that election 
within such time without the consent of the Commissioner. Such blanket 
permission to revoke an election will be provided by the permanent 
regulations in the event of a determination by the Secretary or his 
delegate that such regulations contain provisions that may not 
reasonably have been anticipated by taxpayers at the time of making such 
election.
    (iii) Election treated as tentative. Until the expiration of the 
reasonable period referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or 
the 90-day period referred to in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, 
an election under section 433(d)(2) of the Act will be considered a 
tentative election, subject to revocation under the provisions of such 
subdivisions.
    (iv) Place for filing revocations. A revocation under subdivision 
(i) or (ii) of this subparagraph shall be made by filing a statement to 
that effect with the district director, or the director of the regional 
service center, with whom the election was filed.
    (2) Termination without consent. An election which is made in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section under a section 
referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and is not revoked 
pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may, without the consent 
of the Commissioner, be terminated at any time after making the election 
by filing a statement to that effect with the district director, or the 
director of the regional service center, with whom the election was 
filed. This statement giving notice of termination must be filed before 
the beginning of the month specified in the statement for which the 
termination is to be effective. If pursuant to this subparagraph the 
taxpayer terminates an election made under any such section, he may not 
thereafter make a new election under that section with respect to the 
facility, property, or equipment to which the termination relates.
    (d) Furnishing of supplementary information required. If the 
permanent regulations which are issued under the section of the Code or 
Act referred to in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section to which the 
election relates require the furnishing of information in addition to 
that which was furnished with the statement of election filed pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the taxpayer must furnish such 
additional information in a statement addressed to the district 
director, or the director of the regional service center, with whom the 
election was filed. This statement must clearly identify the election 
and the taxable year for which it was made.
    (e) Other elections. Elections under the following sections of the 
Code may not be made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section but 
are to be made under regulations, whether temporary or permanent, which 
will be issued

[[Page 627]]

under amendments made by the Act. If necessary, such regulations will 
provide a reasonable period of time within which taxpayers will be 
permitted to make elections under these sections for taxable years 
ending before the date on which such regulations are filed with the 
Office of the Federal Register:

    (a) In general. Under section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954 any person who performs services in connection with which property 
is transferred which at the time of transfer is not transferable by the 
transferee and is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture may elect 
to include in his gross income for the taxable year in which such 
property is transferred, the excess of the fair market value of such 
property at the time of transfer (determined without regard to any 
restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will never 
lapse) over the amount (if any) paid for such property. If this election 
is made section 33(a) does not apply with respect to such property, and 
any subsequent appreciation in the value of the property is not taxable 
as compensation. However, if the property is later forfeited, no 
deduction is allowed to any person with respect to such forfeiture. This 
election is not necessary in the case of property which is transferred 
subject only to a restriction which by its terms will never lapse.
    (b) Manner of making election. The election referred to in paragraph 
(a) of this section is made by filing two copies of a written statement 
with the internal revenue officer with whom the person who performed the 
services files his return.
    (c) Additional copies. The person who performed the services shall 
also submit a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (b) of this 
section to the person for whom the services are performed, and, in 
addition, if the person who performs the services in connection with 
which restricted property is transferred and the transferee of such 
property are not the same person, the person who performs the services 
shall submit a copy of such statement to the transferee of the property.
    (d) Content of statement. The statement shall indicate that it is 
being made under section 83(b) of the Code, and shall contain the 
following information:
    (1) The name, address, taxpayer identification number and the 
taxable year (For example, ``Calendar year 1969'' or ``Fiscal year 
ending May 31, 1970'') of the person who performed the services;
    (2) A description of each property with respect to which the 
election is being made;
    (3) The date or dates on which the property is transferred;
    (4) The nature of the restriction or restrictions to which the 
property is subject;
    (5) The fair market value at the time of transfer (determined 
without regard

[[Page 628]]

to any restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will 
never lapse) of each property with respect to which the election is 
being made; and
    (6) The amount (if any) paid for such property.
    (e) Time for making election. The statement referred to in paragraph 
(b) of this section shall be filed not later than 30 days after the date 
the property was transferred (or, if later, January 29, 1970). Any 
statement filed before February 15, 1970, may be amended not later than 
30 days after the publication of this Treasury decision in the Federal 
Register in order to make it conform to the requirements of paragraph 
(d) of this section (January 17, 1970).
    (f) Revocability of election. An election under section 83(b) may 
not be revoked except with the consent of the Commissioner.

Sec. 301.9100-19T   Election relating to passive investment income of electing small business corporations.

    (a) In general. Section 3(a) of the Act of April 14, 1966 (Pub. L. 
89-389) amends section 1372(e)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 
(relating to passive investment income of electing small business 
corporations). This amendment, which applies to taxable years of 
electing small business corporations ending after April 14, 1966, 
provides, in general, that an election of a small business corporation 
under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not terminate for a taxable year 
of the corporation in which it has gross receipts more than 20 percent 
of which is passive investment income, if--
    (1) Such taxable year is the first taxable year in which the 
corporation commenced the active conduct of any trade or business or the 
next succeeding taxable year; and
    (2) The amount of passive investment income for such taxable year is 
less than $3,000.

Section 3(b) of the Act of April 14, 1966, provides that the amendment 
made by section 3(a) thereof shall also apply to taxable years of a 
corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 
15, 1966, if the corporation elects to have the amendment apply to such 
years, and all persons (or their personal representatives) who were 
shareholders of such corporation at any time during any of such years 
consent to such election and the application of the amendment. This 
section prescribes the time for, and manner of, making such election and 
consents, and also extends the time within which certain new 
shareholders may consent to an election under section 1372(a) of the 
Code.
    (b) Application of amendment to taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966--(1) In general. An 
election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not be 
treated as terminated under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code for any 
taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and 
ending before April 15, 1966, if--
    (i) Such taxable year is the first taxable year in which the 
corporation commenced the active conduct of any trade or business, or 
the next succeeding taxable year;
    (ii) The amount of passive investment income for such taxable year 
is less than $3,000;
    (iii) The corporation makes an election, within such time and in 
such manner as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph; and
    (iv) All persons (or their personal representatives) who were 
shareholders of the corporation at any time during any taxable year of 
the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before 
April 15, 1966, consent to such election, within such time and in such 
manner as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.

If an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code is not 
treated as terminated for a taxable year of the corporation as a result 
of an election and consents under this paragraph, such election under 
section 1372(a) of the Code shall be treated as being in effect with 
respect to all subsequent taxable years of the corporation unless it is 
otherwise terminated or revoked for any such subsequent year pursuant to 
section 1372(e) of the Code.

[[Page 629]]

    (2) Election by corporation. An election by a corporation pursuant 
to subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph shall be filed with the 
district director with whom the corporation was required to file its 
return of income (see section 6037 of the Code and the regulations 
thereunder) for the earliest of its taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966, for which an 
election terminated under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code. Such election 
shall be filed within 3 years after the date prescribed by law (not 
including any extension thereof) on which such return was required to be 
filed, or within 90 days from February 28, 1967, whichever is later. 
(However, credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the 
election may not be allowed or made if claim therefor has not been filed 
within the time prescribed by law; and, see subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph providing that the statutory period for assessment of certain 
deficiencies against shareholders may not have expired on the date the 
election and consents under this paragraph are filed.) Such election 
shall be in the form of a statement, signed by a person authorized to 
sign the corporation's return of income, which shall expressly provide 
that the corporation elects the application of section 1372(e)(5) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Pub. L. 89-389, with respect to its 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 
15, 1966. The statement shall set forth the name, address, and employer 
identification number of the corporation; the internal revenue officer 
with whom the corporation's returns of income have been filed for each 
of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; the names and 
addresses of all persons who have been shareholders of the corporation 
at any time during each of its taxable years beginning after December 
31, 1962; computations showing the amount of the corporation's 
overpayment or deficiency of tax for any taxable year which is 
attributable to the election under this paragraph; and computations 
showing each shareholder's portion of the undistributed taxable income 
(determined as provided in section 1373(b) of the Code) or net operating 
loss (determined as provided in section 1374(c) of the Code) for each 
taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, 
unless such computations were made on the corporation's returns of 
income for each of such years. In order for an election under this 
paragraph to be effective, it must be accompanied by the consents of 
certain shareholders as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
    (3) Consents by shareholders. An election by a corporation pursuant 
to this paragraph must be accompanied by the consent of each person who 
was a shareholder of the corporation at any time during any taxable year 
of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before 
April 15, 1966. This includes persons who may not be shareholders on the 
date the election is filed. Where stock of the corporation was owned by 
a husband and wife as community property (or the income from which was 
community property), or was owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, 
or tenants by the entirety, each person who had a community interest in 
such stock and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the 
entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be 
made by the minor or by his legal guardian, or by his natural guardian 
if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall 
be made by the executor or administrator thereof. If a person who is 
required to file a consent under this subparagraph is deceased, the 
executor or administrator of such person's estate, or other person 
charged with the property of such person, shall file the required 
consent. The consent of each shareholder shall be in the form of a 
statement signed by the shareholder in which he states that he consents 
to the election by the corporation under this paragraph. Each of such 
statements shall set forth the name and address of the corporation and 
of the shareholder; the number of shares of stock of the corporation 
owned by such shareholder at any time during any taxable year of the 
corporation beginning after December 31, 1962; the date (or dates) on 
which such stock was acquired, and, if

[[Page 630]]

disposed of, the date (or dates) of disposition; and the internal 
revenue officer with whom the shareholder's income tax returns have been 
filed for each of such taxable years in which he owned any such stock. 
In addition, a consent under this paragraph is not effective unless (i) 
the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for each taxable 
year for which there would be a deficiency attributable to the election 
and consents under this paragraph has not expired on the date the 
election and consents under this paragraph are filed, and (ii) there is 
included in, or attached to, the statement of consent a written consent 
that the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for any 
taxable year (to the extent that such deficiency is attributable to the 
election and consents under this paragraph) shall not expire before the 
expiration of 1 year after the date the election and consents under this 
paragraph are filed. Each of the statements of consent under this 
subparagraph shall be filed with the corporation's election under this 
paragraph. The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one 
statement.
    (4) Election and consents are binding. The election and consents 
under this paragraph are binding and may not be withdrawn.
    (c) New shareholders. Section 1372(e)(1) of the Code provides that 
an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall 
terminate if certain new shareholders do not consent to such election 
within the time prescribed by regulations. New shareholders of a 
corporation which makes an election under paragraph (b) of this section 
may not have consented to the corporation's election under section 
1372(a) of the Code within such prescribed time as a result of a 
termination of such election under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code prior 
to the enactment of Pub. L. 89-389. Therefore, notwithstanding the 
provisions of section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, and the regulations 
thereunder, an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the 
Code shall not be treated as terminated for the failure of any new 
shareholder to file a timely consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the 
Code, for any of the taxable years of the corporation between and 
including the earliest taxable year determined under subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph, and the taxable year during which the corporation files 
an election under paragraph (b) of this section, if--
    (1) The corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code 
would have terminated for a taxable year under section 1372(e)(5) of the 
Code in the event it had not made an election under paragraph (b) of 
this section, and
    (2) A proper consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code is filed 
by such new shareholder with the corporation's election under paragraph 
(b) of this section.

Sec. 301.9100-20T   Election to treat certain distributions as made on the last day of the taxable year.

    (a) In general. Section 233(b) of the Revenue Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 
112) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by adding to section 1375 
a new subsection (e) (relating to certain distributions after close of 
taxable year). Section 1375(e) provides that a corporation, with the 
consent of its shareholders, may elect, for purposes of chapter 1 of the 
Code, to treat a distribution of money made after the close of the 
taxable year as made, and as received by its shareholders, on the last 
day of such taxable year if the following conditions are satisfied:
    (1) The corporation makes a distribution of money to its 
shareholders on or before the 15th day of the third month following the 
close of a taxable year with respect to which it was an electing small 
business corporation within the meaning of section 1371(b);
    (2) Such distribution is made pursuant to a resolution of the 
corporation's board of directors, adopted before the close of such 
taxable year, to distribute to its shareholders all or a part of the 
proceeds of one or more sales of capital assets, or of property 
described in section 1231(b), made during such taxable year; and
    (3) Each shareholder on the day such distribution is received--
    (i) Owns the same proportion of the stock of the corporation on such 
day as

[[Page 631]]

he owned on the last day of such taxable year, and
    (ii) Consents to such election. Section 1375(e) applies only with 
respect to taxable years of corporations beginning after December 31, 
1957.
    (b) Time and manner for making election--(1) Taxable years ending 
after February 26, 1964. For taxable years ending after February 26, 
1964, an election under section 1375(e) with respect to a taxable year 
shall be made by attaching to the corporation income tax return for such 
taxable year, filed not later than the time (including extensions 
thereof) prescribed by law, the following documents:
    (i) A statement that the corporation elects the application of 
section 1375(e) and the date and amount of each distribution to which 
the election applies;
    (ii) A copy of the resolution of the board of directors referred to 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and
    (iii) A statement of the consent of each shareholder of the 
corporation containing the information required by, and filed in the 
manner provided in, paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and ending on 
or before February 26, 1964. For taxable years beginning after December 
31, 1957, and ending on or before February 26, 1964, an election under 
section 1375(e) with respect to a taxable year shall be made on or 
before June 25, 1964, by either attaching the documents described in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to its income tax return for such 
taxable year, or by filing such documents with the district director 
with whom the corporation has filed, or intends to file, its income tax 
return for such taxable year.
    (3) Election is binding. An election under subparagraph (1) or (2) 
of this paragraph is binding and may not be withdrawn.
    (c) Shareholders' consent. The consent of a shareholder to an 
election under section 1375(e) shall be in the form of a statement 
signed by the shareholder in which such shareholder consents to the 
election of the corporation. Such shareholder's consent is binding and 
may not be withdrawn after a valid election is made by the corporation. 
Each person who is a shareholder of the electing corporation must 
consent to the election; thus, where stock of the corporation is owned 
by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from which is 
community property), or is owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or 
tenants by the entirety, each person having a community interest in such 
stock and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the 
entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be 
made by the minor or by his legal guardian, or his natural guardian if 
no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be 
made by the executor or administrator thereof. The statement shall set 
forth the name, address, and account number of the corporation and of 
the shareholder, the date the distribution is received, the number and 
proportion of the shares of stock of the corporation owned by him on the 
date the distribution is received, and the number and proportion of such 
shares owned by him on the last day of the taxable year of the 
corporation with respect to which the election is made. The consents of 
all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.

Sec. 302.1   Statutory provisions and Executive order; section 212 of the International Claims Settlement Act, and Executive Order 10644.

    Sec. 212. (a) The vesting in any officer or agency designated by the 
President under this title of any property or the receipt by such 
designee of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not 
render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax for 
any period before or after such vesting.
    (b) The officer or agency designated by the President under this 
title shall, notwithstanding the filing of any claim or the institution 
of any suit under this title, pay any

[[Page 633]]

tax incident to any such property, or the earnings, increment, or 
proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not 
contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner shall 
not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, earnings, 
increment, or proceeds are held by such designee, unless they are 
returned pursuant to this title without payment of such tax by the 
designee. Every such tax shall be paid by the designee to the same 
extent, as nearly as may be deemed practicable, as though the property 
had not been vested, and shall be paid only out of the property, or 
earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or 
out of other property acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, 
increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from 
any property or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof while held 
by the designee except with his consent. Where any property is 
transferred otherwise than pursuant to section 207(a) or 207(b) hereof, 
the designee may transfer the property free and clear of any tax, except 
to the extent of any lien for a tax existing and perfected at the date 
of vesting, and the proceeds of such transfer shall, for tax purposes, 
replace the property in the hands of the designee.
    (c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the 
manner of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation by 
reason of this enumeration, the applicability in such computation of 
credits, deductions, and exemptions to which the former owner is or 
would be entitled, and the time and manner of any payment of such taxes 
and the extent of any compliance by the designee with provisions of 
Federal law and regulations applicable with respect to Federal taxes, 
shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of 
the Treasury to effectuate this section. Statutes of limitations on 
assessments, collection, refund, or credit of Federal taxes shall be 
suspended with respect to any vested property or the earnings, 
increment, or proceeds thereof, while vested and for six months 
thereafter; but no interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect 
to any period during which the statute of limitations is so suspended.
    (d) The word ``tax'' as used in this section shall include, without 
limitation by reason of this enumeration, any property, income, excess-
profits, war-profits, excise, estate, and employment tax, import duty, 
and special assessment; and also any interest, penalty, additional 
amount, or addition thereto not arising from any act, omission, neglect, 
failure, or delay on the part of the designee.

    (a) Property covered. The regulations in this part are applicable in 
connection with property vested in the Attorney General pursuant to 
section 202 (a) of the Act and in connection with the net proceeds of 
any property described under section 202(b) of such Act which was vested

<R05>
Sec. 302.1-3   Protection of internal revenue prior to tax determination.

    (a) Suits and claims for return of vested property--(1) General. The 
provisions of this paragraph apply in cases where there has been neither 
a final nor a tentative determination of internal revenue tax liability. 
See paragraphs (e) and (f) of Sec. 302.1-4. In such cases vested 
property (including property vested pursuant to section 202(a) of the 
Act which is subject to divestment by reason of its ownership by a 
natural person) shall not be returned or divested except in accordance 
with this paragraph.
    (2) Notice to Commissioner--(i) Suits for recovery. Where suit for 
the return of vested property has been instituted pursuant to section 
207(a) of the Act, the Attorney General shall within a reasonable time 
after answer has been filed or after beginning of the trial of the case 
notify the Commissioner in writing of the property involved and the 
name, address, citizenship, residence, and business organization of the 
claimant, and any other pertinent information.
    (ii) Return without suit. Where the Attorney General has determined 
that pursuant to section 207(b) of the Act vested property is to be 
returned to the claimant, the Attorney General shall notify the 
Commissioner in writing in the manner prescribed in subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph at least 90 days prior to any return of such property.
    (3) Return of property--(i) By divestment. Where the Attorney 
General has determined that property vested pursuant to section 202(a) 
of the Act was directly owned by a natural person, the Attorney General 
shall not divest himself of such property and restore it to its blocked 
status prior to vesting unless there has been a determination of tax 
liability pursuant to Sec. 302.1-4 and a payment of such tax pursuant to 
Sec. 302.1-5.
    (ii) Without security. Where vested property is the subject of a 
suit or proceeding pursuant to the Act, it may be returned without 
security prior to determination of applicable internal revenue taxes and 
prior to the judgment of the court or to the publication of the order of 
the Attorney General directing such return to the following described 
claimants under conditions hereinafter stated:
    (a) Residents and domestic enterprises. In the case of claimants who 
at the time of return are (1) individuals permanently resident in the 
United States since December 7, 1941, or (2) corporations or other 
business enterprises organized under the laws of the United

[[Page 635]]

States, or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District 
of Columbia, or doing business in the United States, the Attorney 
General may without notice to the Commissioner return the property at 
any time.
    (b) Non-residents, etc. In the case of claimants who at the time of 
return are (1) individuals not permanently resident in the United States 
since December 7, 1941, or (2) nondomestic corporations or other 
nondomestic enterprises not doing business within the United States, the 
property may be returned not less than 90 days after notice by the 
Attorney General to the Commissioner in a case within subparagraph 
(2)(i) of this paragraph, or not less than 60 days after notice in a 
case within subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph (a), unless within 
such time the Attorney General is advised otherwise by the Commissioner.
    (iii) When security required. Except as provided in subdivisions (i) 
and (ii) of this subparagraph, vested property shall not be released 
prior to determination of tax liability without security satisfactory to 
the Commissioner, but determination of tax liability will be expedited 
in order that the release of the property or of the security shall not 
be unnecessarily delayed.
    (4) Security. When security is required under subparagraph (3)(iii) 
of this paragraph (a), it shall be such of the following as the 
Commissioner considers necessary:
    (i) Bond. A bond of the claimant conditioned upon payment of the 
full amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due, filed with 
the district director in such amount, and with such sureties, as the 
Commissioner deems necessary. Only surety companies holding a 
certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury may be used.
    (ii) Collateral security. Collateral authorized by law deposited by 
the claimant in lieu of surety conditioned upon the payment of the full 
amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due.
    (iii) Reservation of assets. Monies, or if the monies are 
insufficient, so much of the other property involved, to be reserved by 
the Attorney General, as will be sufficient in the judgment of the 
Attorney General to cover any internal revenue tax liability determined 
by the Commissioner.
    (b) Vested property subject to debt claims--(1) Notice to 
Commissioner. With respect to vested property available for the payment 
of debt claims pursuant to section 208 of the Act, and with respect to 
which debt claims have been filed, prior to the allowance of any such 
claims the Attorney General shall in writing notify the Commissioner of 
the property involved, the citizenship, residence, business organization 
and other necessary information concerning the debtor and the aggregate 
of debt claims filed in respect thereof.
    (2) Action by Commissioner. Upon receipt of the notice provided in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), the Commissioner shall, as soon 
as practicable and not later than 120 days after receipt of notice, 
unless the time is extended by the Commissioner after notice to the 
Attorney General, (i) determine the taxes payable by the Attorney 
General in respect of the debtor, or (ii) advise the Attorney General of 
the provision, if any, to be made by him for payment of taxes with 
respect of the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 302.1-4   Computation of taxes.

    (a) Detail of employees of the Internal Revenue Service. The 
Commissioner will detail for the assistance of the Attorney General such 
employees of the Internal Revenue Service as may be necessary to make 
the computations under the regulations in this part promptly and 
accurately.
    (b) Relationship of Attorney General and former owner. In the 
computation of tax liability under the regulations in this part, except 
as otherwise provided herein, the vesting of property shall not be 
considered as affecting the ownership thereof; and any act of the 
Attorney General in respect of such property (including the collection 
or operation thereof and any investment, sale, or other disposition and 
any payment or other expenditure) shall be considered as the act of the 
owner. Nevertheless, except as otherwise provided in the Act or the 
regulations in this part, insofar as taxes are incident to the vested 
property during the period of vesting, they shall be payable by the

[[Page 636]]

Attorney General, except that to the extent of the value of any of the 
property returned to the former owner the latter shall be liable for 
such tax not paid by the Attorney General. While tax incident to 
nonvested property is collectible out of both vested and nonvested 
property, the nonvested property will be regarded as the primary source 
of collection of such tax. In determining the amount of liability to be 
paid out of property not vested by the Attorney General a computation 
shall be made covering the taxpayer's full period of liability, but 
without regard to the vested property, or the income received by, or the 
operations of, the Attorney General. The amount so computed shall be 
first asserted against and collected so far as practicable from the 
taxpayer or out of his property which is not vested. Such part of the 
total tax liability as is not paid by the taxpayer or collected out of 
property not vested shall be asserted against the vested property. See 
Sec. 302.1-5, relating to payment of taxes, and Sec. 302.1-7, relating 
to claims for credit or refund.
    (c) Laws applicable to computations. Except as otherwise 
specifically provided in the regulations in this part, the computation 
under the regulations in this part of any internal revenue tax liability 
shall be in accordance with the internal revenue laws and regulations 
applicable thereto, including all amendments of such laws or regulations 
enacted or promulgated prior to determination of the tax.
    (d) Periods for which computations made. The amount of income, 
declared value excess profits, excess profits, capital stock, 
employment, and excise taxes under the internal revenue laws will be 
computed for each taxable year or period during all or part of which 
property is vested prior to the return of the property. In the case of a 
return of property prior to computation of tax, see Sec. 302.1-3. Where 
vesting occurs during a taxable year or taxable period, any return filed 
or computation made covering vested or nonvested property should 
nevertheless be for the entire year or period. See paragraph (b) of this 
section. Unless facts are available indicating a liability for taxes for 
a taxable year or period occurring wholly prior or subsequent to the 
period of vesting of the property by the Attorney General, the 
computations under the regulations in this part, both tentative and 
final, will be made only in respect of years and periods during all or 
part of which the property is held by the Attorney General.
    (e) Tentative computation. In order that the return of property or 
other appropriate action may not be delayed until the amount of taxes 
payable is finally computed and paid, a tentative computation of such 
amount will be made in every case, unless there are circumstances 
appearing to make such action inappropriate. Such circumstances would 
include (1) return of the property in accordance with Sec. 302.1-3, (2) 
notice to the Commissioner by the person to whom the property is 
returnable or by the Attorney General that such person or the Attorney 
General, as the case may be, prefers that the return of the property be 
postponed until the amount of such taxes can be finally computed or (3) 
belief on the part of the Commissioner that a final computation will not 
unduly delay the return of, or other appropriate action with respect to, 
the property. In making any such tentative computation of income, 
profits, or estate tax, the gross income or the gross estate, as the 
case may be, as shown by the records of the Attorney General (excluding 
therefrom items exempt from taxation) shall be considered as the taxable 
or net income or taxable or net estate, respectively, unless a tax 
return has been filed or facts are available upon which a more accurate 
computation can be made. In any case in which a duly authorized officer 
or employee of the Internal Revenue Service has otherwise computed the 
amount of taxes payable in respect of any period, such computation will 
be accepted as a tentative computation, unless the facts clearly 
indicate that a more accurate computation can be made.
    (f) Final computation--(1) General. A final computation of the 
amount of taxes payable by the person to whom property is returnable, or 
out of property to be returned, will be made as soon as practicable in 
every case. In any case in which the amount shown by a tentative 
computation has been paid, refund or credit of any amount

[[Page 637]]

paid in excess of the amount properly due will be made in accordance 
with the final computation, even though a claim therefor has not been 
filed, if the period of limitation applicable to the filing of such 
claim has not expired. However, if it is desired to protect the right to 
any credit or refund determined to be due, a claim for credit or refund 
should be filed. The sufficiency of any such claim in respect of any 
amount paid in accordance with a tentative computation under the 
regulations in this part will not be questioned solely because facts 
upon which a more accurate computation could be made are not available 
or cannot be established at the time such claim is filed. Any such claim 
in respect of an amount paid in accordance with a final computation 
must, however, clearly set forth in detail under penalties of perjury 
all the facts relied upon in support of the claim and must conform to 
the regulations applicable to an ordinary claim for refund or credit. 
See Sec. 302.1-7 relating to claims for credit or refunds.
    (2) Information required--(i) Income and profit taxes. The following 
information submitted under penalties of perjury by or for the taxpayer 
is necessary in each case for a final computation, for each taxable year 
for which the computation is to be made:
    (a) All income (other than income received by the Attorney General) 
from sources within the United States, or if no such income has been 
received, then a statement to that effect, except that in the case of a 
citizen or resident of the United States, income from sources without as 
well as within the United States must be shown.
    (b) If a return of such income has been made, then the following 
data in respect of such return:
    (1) The taxable year for which the return was made and the tax 
(whether income, declared value excess profits, or excess profits tax) 
paid;
    (2) The name of the taxpayer for whom the return was made;
    (3) The name of the agent or other person (if any) by whom such 
return was made;
    (4) The office of the district director in which such return was 
filed.
    (c) Such other facts as may be required, from time to time, by the 
Commissioner.
    (ii) Other taxes. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph, in order to make a final computation of the amount of 
any internal revenue tax payable by return in any case, the usual return 
should be filed, together with the supporting documents required by the 
regulations pertaining to the tax.
    (g) Tax returns--(1) General. In many cases allowance of deductions 
and credits is contingent upon the making of a return in accordance with 
the applicable internal revenue law. The submission of evidence relative 
to income or profits tax in accordance with subdivisions (a) and (c) of 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section will be considered as the making of 
the return required by any such law, only (i) for any taxable period, 
ending on or before December 31, 1946, during all or part of which all 
or part of the property of the taxpayer was held by the Attorney 
General, or (ii) for any taxable period ending within one year from the 
date of the first return to the taxpayer of any part of the property 
held by the Attorney General, whichever period ends later. In all other 
cases a return will be required in accordance with the applicable 
internal revenue law and regulations. In the case of returns where 
property is vested during a taxable year or period, see paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (2) Estates and trusts. In the case of estates and trusts the 
fiduciaries shall file returns, including information returns as 
required by section 147 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (3) Income tax forms to be used--(i) General. In the case of 
taxpayers engaged in trade or business in the United States Forms 1040B 
and 1120, as may be appropriate, shall be used. Where the taxpayer is 
not engaged in trade or business in the United States, Form M797 may be 
used in lieu of Forms 1040NB, 1040NB-a, and 1120NB.
    (ii) Definition. When used in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, 
the term ``engaged in trade or business in the United States'' includes 
the managing and renting of real estate in the United

[[Page 638]]

States by an agent of the Attorney General or of the former owner duly 
authorized to execute rental agreements and to pay all taxes and charges 
incident to the repair and maintenance of such property, but does not 
include the mere renting or leasing of property under agreement 
requiring the lessee or occupant to pay taxes and to make repairs or 
improvements.


<R05>
Sec. 302.1-5  Payment of taxes.

    (a) Pursuant to tentative computations. The amount of taxes shown by 
a tentative computation, shall be paid by the Attorney General or the 
taxpayer, as the case may be, to the district director as soon as 
practicable after the tentative computation has been made. It will not 
be necessary, however, for the payment by the Attorney General to be 
made prior to the return of property if an amount sufficient to cover 
all internal revenue taxes is retained from the property by the Attorney 
General.
    (b) Pursuant to final computations. Upon a final computation of 
internal revenue taxes properly payable, the amount thereof remaining 
unpaid shall be paid by the Attorney General to the district director as 
soon as practicable after the final computation has been made, or, in 
case the property has been returned to the former owner, by such owner. 
If the final computation shows that the full amount of internal revenue 
taxes properly payable is less than the amount previously paid, the 
difference shall be credited or refunded in accordance with the 
provisions of the regulations in this part and other applicable 
regulations. A final computation will not prohibit a subsequent 
recomputation if it is determined that the amount shown by the final 
computation is erroneous.
    (c) Deficiency procedure. The Attorney General shall pay internal 
revenue taxes without regard to the provisions of law relating to the 
sending of a deficiency notice by certified or registered mail or to 
notice and demand.


<R05>
Sec. 302.1-6  Interest and penalties.

    (a) Liability for interest and civil penalties. Under subsection (d) 
of section 212 of the Act there is no liability for interest or penalty 
on account of any act or failure of the Attorney General. Such 
subsection is not applicable to interest or penalties payable in respect 
of any act or failure during the period prior to the vesting of the 
property by the Attorney General, or after the return of the property, 
or during the period during which the property was vested by the 
Attorney General on account of an act or ommission of any person other 
than the Attorney General.
    (b) Adjustment. In case of any assessment or collection, or credit 
or refund, of interest or a civil penalty contrary to section 212 (c) or 
(d) of the Act, proper adjustment shall be made.


<R05>
Sec. 302.1-7  Claims for credit or refund.

    (a) Time for filing claims. Claims for credit or refund must be 
filed within the period prescribed by section 322 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939 or by section 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954, as modified by section 212(c) of the Act. Any such claim must 
contain a detailed statement under penalties of perjury of all the facts 
relied upon in support of the claim and should be filed with the 
district director of the district in which the tax was paid. See 
paragraph (f)(1) of Sec. 302.1-4 relating to final computation.
    (b) Attorney General acting for taxpayer. Any act of the Attorney 
General for, or on behalf of, a taxpayer in respect of any claim under 
the regulations in this part will be considered as the act of such 
taxpayer, unless such taxpayer notifies the Commissioner in writing, by 
the filing of a claim for refund or credit or otherwise, that he does 
not ratify such act. See paragraph (b) of Sec. 302.1-4 relating to 
relationship of Attorney General and former owner.
    (c) Refund payable to Attorney General. All refund of taxes paid by 
the Attorney General shall be made directly to that official.

Sec. 303.1  Statutory provisions; section 36, Trading With the Enemy Act.

    Sec. 36 (a) The vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property 
Custodian of any property or interest (other than any property or 
interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or 
the receipt by him of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall 
not render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax 
for any period prior or subsequent to the date of such vesting or 
transfer, nor render applicable the exemptions provided in title II of 
the Social Security Act with respect to service performed in the employ 
of the United States Government or of any instrumentality of the United 
States.
    (b) The Alien Property Custodian shall, notwithstanding the filing 
of any claim or the institution of any suit under this Act, pay any tax 
incident to any such property or interest, or the earnings, increment, 
or proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not 
contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner shall 
not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, interest, 
earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by the Alien Property 
Custodian, unless they are returned pursuant to this Act without payment 
of such tax by the Alien Property Custodian. Every such tax shall be 
paid by the Alien Property Custodian to the same extent, as nearly as 
may be deemed practicable, as though the property or interest had not 
been vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall 
be paid only out of the property or interest, or earnings, increment, or 
proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other property or 
interests acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, increment, 
or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from any property 
or interest or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof while held 
by the Alien Property Custodian except with his consent. Where any 
property or interest is transferred, otherwise than pursuant to section 
9(a) or 32 hereof, the Alien Property Custodian may transfer the 
property or interest free and clear of any tax, except to the extent of 
any lien for a tax existing and perfected at the date of vesting, and 
the proceeds of such transfer shall, for tax purposes, replace the 
property or interest in the hands of the Alien Property Custodian.
    (c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, the manner 
of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation by reason 
of this enumeration, the applicability in such computation of credits, 
deductions, and exemptions to which the former owner is or would be 
entitled, and the time and manner of any payment of such taxes and the 
extent of any compliance by the Custodian with provisions of Federal law 
and regulations applicable with respect to Federal taxes, shall be in 
accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury to 
effectuate this section. Statutes of limitations on assessment, 
collection, refund, or credit of Federal taxes shall be suspended with 
respect to any vested property or interest, or the earnings, increment 
or proceeds thereof, while vested and for six months thereafter; but no 
interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect to any period during 
which the statute of limitations is so suspended.
    (d) The word ``tax'' as used in this section shall include, without 
limitation by reason of this enumeration, any property, income, excess-
profits, war-profits, excise, estate and employment tax, import duty, 
and special assessment; and also any interest, penalty, additional 
amount, or addition thereto not arising from any act, omission, neglect, 
failure, or delay on the part of the Custodian.
    (e) Any tax exemption accorded to the Alien Property Custodian by 
specific provision of existing law shall not be affected by this 
section.

Sec. 303.1-2   Application of part.

    (a) Property covered. This part is applicable in connection with 
property vested in the Attorney General on and after December 18, 1941. 
It is not applicable in connection with property or interest in property 
so vested or acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941, 
which property or interest is governed by Treasury Decision 4168, 
approved June 21, 1928, as amended by Treasury Decision 4254, approved

Government employee, permanent or temporary, for services immediately 
connected with the operation of an enterprise under control of the 
Attorney General such as might be rendered to a private operator.


<R05>
Sec. 303.1-3   Protection of internal revenue prior to tax determination.

    (a) Suits and claims for return of vested property--(1) General. The 
provisions of this paragraph apply in cases where there has been neither 
a final nor a tentative determination of internal revenue tax liability. 
See paragraphs (e) and (f) of Sec. 303.1-4. In such cases vested 
property shall not be returned except in accordance with this paragraph.
    (2) Notice to Commissioner--(i) Suits for recovery. Where suit for 
the return of vested property has been instituted under section 9 of the 
Act, within a reasonable time after answer has been filed or after 
beginning of the trial of the case, the Attorney General shall, in 
writing, notify the Commissioner of the property involved and the name, 
address, citizenship, residence, and business organization of the 
claimant, and any other pertinent information.
    (ii) Return without suit. At least 90 days prior to any return of 
vested property pursuant to section 32 of the Act the Attorney General 
shall in writing notify the Commissioner in the manner prescribed in 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
    (3) Return of property--(i) Without security. Vested property, the 
subject of a suit or proceeding pursuant to the Trading With the Enemy 
Act, may be returned without security prior to determination of 
applicable internal revenue taxes and prior to the judgment of the court 
or publication of the order of the Attorney General directing such 
return, to the following described claimants under the conditions 
hereinafter stated:
    (a) Residents and domestic enterprises. In the case of claimants who 
at the time of return are (1) individuals permanently resident in the 
United States since December 7, 1941, or (2) corporations or other 
business enterprises organized under the laws of the United States, or 
any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of 
Columbia, or doing business in the United States, the Attorney General 
may return the property at any time without notice to the Commissioner 
of such return.
    (b) Nonresidents, etc. In the case of claimants who at the time of 
return are (1) individuals not permanently resident of the United States 
since December 7, 1941, or (2) nondomestic corporations or other 
nondomestic business enterprises not doing business within the United 
States, the property may be returned not less than 90 days after notice 
by the Attorney General to the Commissioner in a case within 
subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph (a), or not less than 60 days 
after notice in a case within subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph 
(a), unless within such time the Attorney General is advised otherwise 
by the Commissioner.
    (ii) When security required. Except as provided in subdivision (i) 
of this subparagraph vested property shall not be released prior to 
determination of tax liability without security satisfactory to the 
Commissioner, but determination of tax liability will be expedited in 
order that release of the property or of the security shall not be 
unnecessarily delayed.
    (4) Security. Security when required shall be such of the following 
as shall, in the judgment of the Commissioner, be appropriate:
    (i) Bond. A bond of the claimant conditioned upon payment of the 
full amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due, filed with 
the district director in such amount, and with such sureties, as the 
Commissioner deems necessary. Only surety companies holding a 
certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury may be used.

[[Page 642]]

    (ii) Collateral security. Collateral authorized by law deposited by 
the claimant in lieu of surety conditioned upon the payment of the full 
amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due.
    (iii) Reservation of assets. Moneys, or if the moneys are 
insufficient, so much of the other property involved, to be reserved by 
the Attorney General, as will be sufficient in the judgment of the 
Attorney General to cover any internal revenue tax liability determined 
by the Commissioner.
    (b) Vested property subject to debt claims--(1) Notice to 
Commissioner. With respect to vested property available for the payment 
of debt claims under section 34 of the Act, and with respect to which 
debt claims have been filed, prior to the allowance of any such claims 
the Attorney General shall, in writing, notify the Commissioner of the 
property involved, the citizenship, residence, business organization, 
and other necessary information concerning the debtor and the aggregate 
of debt claims filed in respect thereof.
    (2) Action by Commissioner. Upon receipt of the notice provided in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), the Commissioner shall, as soon 
as practicable and not later than 120 days after receipt of notice, 
unless the time is extended by the Commissioner after notice to the 
Attorney General--
    (i) Determine the taxes payable by the Attorney General in respect 
of the debtor, or
    (ii) Advise the Attorney General of the provision, if any, to be 
made by him for payment of taxes in respect of the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 303.1-4   Computation of taxes.

    (a) Detail of employees of the Internal Revenue Service. The 
Commissioner will detail for the assistance of the Attorney General such 
employees of the Internal Revenue Service as may be necessary to make 
the computations under this part promptly and accurately.
    (b) Relationship of Attorney General and former owner. In the 
computation of tax liability under this part, except as otherwise 
provided in this part, the vesting of property shall not be considered 
as affecting the ownership thereof; and any act of the Attorney General 
in respect of such property (including the collection or operation 
thereof and any investment, sale, or other disposition and any payment 
or other expenditure) shall be considered as the act of the owner. 
Nevertheless, except as otherwise provided in the Act or this part, 
insofar as taxes are incident to vested property during the period of 
vesting, they shall be payable by the Attorney General, except that to 
the extent of the value of any of the property returned to the former 
owner the latter shall be liable for such tax not paid by the Attorney 
General. While tax incident to nonvested property is collectible out of 
both vested and nonvested property, the nonvested property will be 
regarded as the primary source of collection of such tax. In determining 
the amount of the liability to be paid out of property not vested by the 
Attorney General a computation shall be made covering the taxpayer's 
full period of liability, but without regard to the vested property, or 
the income received by, or the operations of, the Attorney General. The 
amount so computed shall be first asserted against and collected so far 
as practicable from the taxpayer or out of his property which is not 
vested. Such part of the total tax liability as is not paid by the 
taxpayer or collected out of property not vested shall be asserted 
against the vested property. See Sec.  303.1-5, relating to payment of 
taxes, and Sec. 303.1-7, relating to claims for refund or credit.
    (c) Laws applicable to computation. Except as otherwise specifically 
provided in this part, the computation under this part of any internal 
revenue tax liability shall be in accordance with the internal revenue 
laws and regulations applicable thereto, including all amendments of 
such laws or regulations enacted or promulgated prior to determination 
of the tax.
    (d) Periods for which computations made. The amount of income, 
employment, and excise taxes under the internal revenue laws will be 
computed for each taxable year or period during all or part of which 
property is vested prior to the return of the property. In the case of a 
return of property prior to computation of tax, see Sec. 303.1-3. Where 
vesting occurs during a taxable year or

[[Page 643]]

taxable period, any return filed or computation made covering vested or 
nonvested property should nevertheless be for the entire year or period. 
See paragraph (b) of this section. Unless facts are available indicating 
a liability for taxes for a taxable year or period occurring wholly 
prior or subsequent to the period of vesting of the property by the 
Attorney General, the computations under this part, both tentative and 
final, will be made only in respect of years and periods during all or 
part of which the property is held by the Attorney General.
    (e) Tentative computation. In order that the return of property or 
other appropriate action may not be delayed until the amount of taxes 
payable is finally computed and paid, a tentative computation of such 
amount will be made in every case, unless there are circumstances 
appearing to make such action inappropriate. Such circumstances would 
include (1) return of the property in accordance with Sec. 303.1-3, (2) 
notice to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the person to whom the 
property is returnable or by the Attorney General that such person or 
the Attorney General, as the case may be, prefers that the return of the 
property be postponed until the amount of such taxes can be finally 
computed, or (3) belief on the part of the Commissioner that a final 
computation will not unduly delay the return of, or other appropriate 
action with respect to, the property. In making any such tentative 
computation of income or estate tax, the gross income or the gross 
estate, as the case may be, as shown by the records of the Attorney 
General (excluding therefrom items exempt from taxation) shall be 
considered as the taxable income or taxable estate, respectively, unless 
a tax return has been filed or facts are available upon which a more 
accurate computation can be made. In any case in which a duly authorized 
officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service has otherwise 
computed the amount of taxes payable in respect of any period, such 
computation will be accepted as a tentative computation, unless the 
facts clearly indicate that a more accurate computation can be made.
    (f) Final computation--(1) General. A final computation of the 
amount of taxes payable by the person to whom property is returnable, or 
out of property to be returned, will be made as soon as practicable in 
every case. In any case in which the amount shown by a tentative 
computation has been paid, refund or credit of any amount paid in excess 
of the amount properly due will be made in accordance with the final 
computation, even though a claim therefor has not been filed, if the 
period of limitation applicable to the filing of such claim has not 
expired. However, if it is desired to protect the right to any credit or 
refund determined to be due, a claim for credit or refund should be 
filed. The sufficiency of any such claim in respect of an amount paid in 
accordance with a tentative computation under this part will not be 
questioned solely because facts upon which a more accurate computation 
could be made are not available or cannot be established at the time 
such claim is filed. Any such claim in respect of an amount paid in 
accordance with a final computation must, however, clearly set forth in 
detail under the penalties of perjury all the facts relied upon in 
support of the claim and must conform to the regulations applicable to 
an ordinary claim for refund or credit. See Sec. 301.6402-2 of this 
chapter and Sec. 303.1-7, relating to claims for refund or credit.
    (2) Information required--(i) Income taxes. The following 
information submitted under the penalties of perjury by or for the 
taxpayer is necessary in each case for a final computation, for each 
taxable year for which the computation is to be made:
    (a) All income (other than income received by the Attorney General) 
from sources within the United States, or if no such income has been 
received, then a statement to that effect, except that in the case of a 
citizen or resident of the United States, income from sources without as 
well as within the United States must be shown.
    (b) If a return of such income has been made, then the following 
data in respect of such return:
    (1) The taxable year for which the return was made and the tax paid;

[[Page 644]]

    (2) The name of the taxpayer for whom the return was made;
    (3) The name of the agent or other person (if any) by whom such 
return was made;
    (4) The office of the district director in which the return was 
filed.
    (c) Such other facts as may be required, from time to time, by the 
Commissioner.
    (ii) Other taxes. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph, in order to make a final computation of the amount of 
any internal revenue tax payable by return in any case, the usual return 
should be filed, together with the supporting documents required by the 
regulations pertaining to the tax.
    (g) Tax returns--(1) General. In many cases allowance of deductions 
and credits is contingent upon the making of a return in accordance with 
the applicable internal revenue law. The submission of evidence relative 
to income tax in accordance with subdivisions (a) and (c) of paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section will be considered as the making of the return 
required by any such law, only (i) for any taxable period, ending on or 
before December 31, 1946, during all or part of which all or part of the 
property of the taxpayer was held by the Attorney General, or (ii) for 
any taxable period ending within one year from the date of the first 
return to the taxpayer, of any part of the property held by the Attorney 
General, whichever period ends later. In all other cases a return will 
be required in accordance with the applicable internal revenue laws and 
regulations. In the case of returns where property is vested during a 
taxable year or period, see paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Estates and trusts. In the case of estates and trusts the 
fiduciaries shall file returns, including information returns as 
required by section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (3) Income tax forms to be used. In the case of taxpayers engaged in 
trade or business in the United States Forms 1040B and 1120, as may be 
appropriate, shall be used. Where the taxpayer is not engaged in trade 
or business in the United States, Form M797 may be used in lieu of Forms 
1040NB, 1040NB-a and 1120NB.


<R05>
Sec. 303.1-5   Payment of taxes.

    (a) Pursuant to tentative computations. The amount of taxes shown by 
a tentative computation shall be paid by the Attorney General or the 
taxpayer, as the case may be, to the district director as soon as 
practicable after the tentative computation has been made. It will not 
be necessary, however, for the payment by the Attorney General to be 
made prior to the return of property if an amount sufficient to cover 
all internal revenue taxes is retained from the property by the Attorney 
General.
    (b) Pursuant to final computations. Upon a final computation of 
internal revenue taxes properly payable, the amount thereof remaining 
unpaid shall be paid by the Attorney General to the district director as 
soon as practicable after the final computation has been made, or, in 
case the property has been returned to the former owner, by such owner. 
If the final computation shows that the full amount of internal revenue 
taxes properly payable is less than the amount previously paid, the 
difference shall be credited or refunded in accordance with the 
provisions of these and other applicable regulations. A final 
computation will not prohibit a subsequent recomputation if it is 
determined that the amount shown by the final computation is erroneous.
    (c) Deficiency procedure. The Attorney General shall pay internal 
revenue taxes without regard to the provisions of law relating to the 
sending of a deficiency notice by certified or registered mail or to 
notice and demand.


<R05>
Sec. 303.1-6   Interest and penalties.

    (a) Liability for interest and civil penalties. Under subsection (d) 
of section 36 of the Trading With the Enemy Act there is no liability 
for interest or penalty on account of any act or failure of the Attorney 
General. Such subsection is not applicable to interest or penalties 
payable in respect of any act or failure during the period prior to the 
vesting of the property by the Attorney General, or after the return of 
the property, or during the period during which the property was vested 
by the Attorney General on account of an act or omission of any person 
other than the Attorney General.

[[Page 645]]

    (b) Adjustment. In case of any assessment or collection, or credit 
or refund, of interest or a civil penalty contrary to the provisions of 
section 36 (c) or (d), proper adjustment shall be made.


<R05>
Sec. 303.1-7   Claims for refund or credit.

    (a) Claims for refund or credit must be filed within the period 
prescribed by section 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as 
modified by section 36(c) of the Trading With the Enemy Act. Any such 
claim must contain a detailed statement under the penalties of perjury 
of all the facts relied upon in support of the claim and should be filed 
with the district director for the district in which the tax was paid. 
See paragraph (f)(1) of Sec. 303.1-4, relating to final computation.
    (b) Any act of the Attorney General for, or on behalf of, a taxpayer 
in respect of any claim under this part will be considered as the act of 
such taxpayer, unless such taxpayer notifies the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue in writing, by the filing of a claim for refund or 
credit or otherwise, that he does not ratify such act. See paragraph (b) 
of Sec. 303.1-4, relating to relationship of Attorney General and former 
owner.
    (c) All refund of taxes paid by the Attorney General shall be made 
directly to that official.

305.7871-1  Indian tribal governments treated as States for certain 
          purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 305.7701-1  Definition of Indian tribal government.

    (a) Definition. A governing body of a tribe, band, pueblo, 
community, village, or group of native American Indians, or Alaska 
Natives, qualifies as an Indian tribal government upon determination by 
the Internal Revenue Service that the governing body exercises 
governmental functions. Designation of a governing body as an Indian 
tribal government will be by revenue procedure. If a governing body is 
not currently designated by the applicable revenue procedure as an 
Indian tribal government, and such governing body believes that it 
qualifies for such designation, the governing body may apply for a 
ruling from Internal Revenue Service. In order to qualify as an Indian 
tribal government, for purposes of section 7701(a)(40) and this section, 
such governing body must receive a favorable ruling from the Internal 
Revenue Service. The request for a ruling shall be made in accordance 
with all applicable procedural rules set forth in the Statement of 
Procedural Rules (26 CFR Part 601) and any applicable revenue procedures 
relating to the submission of ruling requests. The request shall be 
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, Associate Chief Counsel 
(Technical), Attention: CC:IND:S, room 6545, 1111 Constitution Avenue, 
NW., Washington, D.C. 20224.
    (b) Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective 
after December 31, 1982.


<R05>
Sec. 305.7871-1  Indian tribal governments treated as States for certain purposes.

    (a) In general. An Indian tribal government, as defined in section 
7701 (a)(40) and the regulations thereunder, shall be treated as a 
State, and a subdivision of an Indian tribal government, as determined 
under section 7871(d) and paragraph (e) of this section, shall be 
treated as a political subdivision of a State, under the following 
sections and regulations thereunder--
    (1) Section 170 (relating to income tax deductions for charitable, 
etc., contributions and gifts), sections 2055 and 2106(a)(2) (relating 
to estate tax deductions for transfers of public, charitable, and 
religious uses), and section 2522 (relating to gift tax deductions for 
charitable and similar gifts), for purposes of determining whether and 
in what amount any contribution or transfer to or for the use of an 
Indian

[[Page 646]]

tribal government (or subdivision thereof) is deductible;
    (2) Section 164 (relating to deductions for taxes);
    (3) Section 511(a)(2)(B) (relating to the taxation of colleges and 
universities which are agencies or instrumentalities of governments or 
their political subdivisions);
    (4) Section 37(e)(9)(A) (relating to certain public retirement 
systems);
    (5) Section 41(c)(4) (defining ``State'' for purposes of credit for 
contributions to candidates for public offices);
    (6) Section 117(b)(2)(A) (relating to scholarships and fellowship 
grants);
    (7) Section 403(b)(1)(A)(ii) (relating to the taxation of 
contributions of certain employers for employee annuities);
    (8) Chapter 41 of the Code (relating to tax on excess expenditures 
to influence legislation); and
    (9) Subchapter A of chapter 42 of the Code (relating to private 
foundations).
    (b) Special rule for excise tax provisions. An Indian tribal 
government shall be treated as a State, and a subdivision of an Indian 
tribal government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a 
State, for purposes of any exemption from, credit or refund of, or 
payment with respect to, an excise tax imposed on a transaction under--
    (1) Chapter 31 of the Code (relating to tax on special fuels);
    (2) Chapter 32 of the Code (relating to manufacturers excise taxes);
    (3) Subchapter B of chapter 33 of the Code (relating to 
communications excise tax); and
    (4) Subchapter D of chapter 36 of the Code (relating to tax on use 
of certain highway vehicles), if, in addition to satisfying all 
requirements applicable to a similar transaction involving a State (or 
political subdivision thereof) under the Code, the transaction involves 
the exercise of an essential governmental function of the Indian tribal 
government, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Special rule for tax-exempt bonds. An Indian tribal government 
shall be treated as a State and a subdivision of an Indian tribal 
government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for 
purposes of any obligation issued by such government or subdivision 
under section 103 (relating to interest on certain governmental 
obligations) if such obligation is part of an issue substantially all of 
the proceeds of which are to be used in the exercise of an essential 
governmental function, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. For 
purposes of section 7871 and this section, the ``substantially all'' 
test is the same as that provided in Sec. 1.103-8(a)(1)(i). An Indian 
tribal government shall not be treated as a State and a subdivision of 
an Indian tribal government shall not be treated as a political 
subdivision of a State, however, for issues of the following private 
activity bonds--
    (1) An industrial development bond (as defined in section 
103(b)(2));
    (2) An obligation described in section 103(l)(1)(A) (relating to 
scholarship bonds); or
    (3) A mortgage subsidy bond (as defined in section 103A(b)(1), 
without regard to section 103A(b)(2)).
    (d) Essential governmental function. For purposes of section 7871 
and this section, an essential governmental function of an Indian tribal 
government (or portion thereof) is a function of a type which is--
    (1) Eligible for funding under 25 U.S.C. 13 and the regulations 
thereunder;
    (2) Eligible for grants or contracts under 25 U.S.C. 450 (f), (g), 
and (h) and the regulations thereunder; or
    (3) An essential governmental function under section 115 and the 
regulations thereunder when conducted by a State or political 
subdivision thereof.
    (e) Treatment of subdivisions of Indian tribal governments as 
political subdivisions. A subdivision of an Indian tribal government 
shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for purposes of 
section 7871 and this section if the Internal Revenue Service determines 
that the subdivision has been delegated the right to exercise one or 
more of the substantial governmental functions of the Indian tribal 
government. Designation of a subdivision of an Indian tribal government 
as a political subdivision of a State will be by revenue procedure. If a 
subdivision of an Indian tribal government is not currently designated 
by the applicable revenue procedure as a political subdivision of a 
State, and

[[Page 647]]

such subdivision believes that it qualifies for such designation, the 
subdivision may apply for a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. In 
order to qualify as a political subdivision of a State, for purposes of 
section 7871 and this section, such subdivision must receive a favorable 
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. The request for a ruling shall 
be made in accordance with all applicable procedural rules set forth in 
the Statement of Procedural Rules (26 CFR Part 601) and any applicable 
revenue procedures relating to submission of ruling requests. The 
request shall be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, Associate 
Chief Counsel (Technical), Attention: CC:IND:S, Room 6545, 1111 
Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, D.C. 20224.
    (f) Effective dates--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section, the provisions of this section are effective 
after December 31, 1982.
    (2) Specific effective dates. Specific provisions of this section 
are effective as follows:
    (i) Provisions relating to Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954 (other than section 103 and section 37(e)(9)(A)) shall apply to 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and before January 1, 
1985;
    (ii) Provisions relating to section 37(e)(9)(A) shall apply to 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and before January 1,

issued after December 31, 1982, and before January 1, 1985;
    (iv) Provisions relating to chapter 11 of the Code shall apply to 
estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1982, and before January 
1, 1985;
    (v) Provisions relating to chapter 12 of the Code shall apply to 
gifts made after December 31, 1982, and before January 1, 1985; and
    (vi) Provisions relating to taxes imposed by subtitle D of the Code 
shall take effect on January 1, 1983 and shall cease to apply at the 
close of December 31, 1984.

<R05>
Sec. 400.1-1   Refiling of notice of tax lien.

    (a) Scope. This section provides rules with respect to the 
provisions contained in section 6323(g), relating to the refiling of a 
notice of lien arising under section 6321. In general, section 6323(g) 
contains new rules requiring the Internal Revenue Service to refile a 
notice of lien during the 1-year period ending 30 days after the 
expiration of the normal 6-year statutory period for collection of an 
assessed tax liability, and each succeeding period of 6 years, in order 
to maintain the effectiveness of a notice of lien. These provisions in 
section 6323 were added by section 101(a) of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 
1966 (80 Stat. 1125), effective after November 2, 1966.
    (b) Requirement to refile. In order to continue the effect of a 
notice of lien, the notice must be refiled in the place described in 
paragraph (c) of this section during the required refiling period 
(described in paragraph (d) of this section). In the event that two or 
more notices of lien are filed with respect to a particular tax 
assessment, the failure to comply with the provisions of paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) and (d) of this section in respect of one of the notices of 
lien does not affect the effectiveness of the refiling of the other 
notice or notices of lien. Thus, except for the filing of a notice of 
lien required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section relating to a 
change of residence, the validity of any refiling of a notice of lien is 
not affected by the refiling or non-refiling of

[[Page 648]]

any other notice of lien. The effectiveness of a timely refiled notice 
of lien relates back to the date on which the notice of lien was 
effective before the refiling. If the district director fails to refile 
a notice of lien in the manner described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section, the notice of lien is not effective, after the expiration 
of the required refiling period, as against any person without regard to 
when the interest of the person in the property subject to the lien was 
acquired. However, the failure of the district director to refile a 
notice of lien during the required refiling period will not affect the 
effectiveness of the notice with respect to (1) property which is the 
subject matter of a suit, to which the United States is a party, 
commenced prior to the expiration of the required refiling period, or 
(2) property which has been levied upon by the United States prior to 
the expiration of the required refiling period. Failure to refile a 
notice of lien does not affect the existence of the lien. If a notice of 
lien is not refiled, and if the lien is still in existence, the Internal 
Revenue Service may nevertheless file a new notice of lien either on the 
form prescribed for the filing of a notice of lien or on the form 
prescribed for refiling a notice of lien. This new filing must meet the 
requirements of section 6323(f) and is effective from the date on which 
such filing is made. Upon written request of any person who has a proper 
interest, any district director may issue a certificate of release of 
lien if notice of the lien has not been refiled within the required 
refiling period and the entire liability for the tax has been satisfied 
or has become unenforceable as a matter of law. Such request should be 
sent to the district director for the internal revenue district shown on 
the notice of lien. For provisions relating to certificates of release 
of lien, see section 6325.
    (c) Place for refiling notice of lien-- (1) In general. A notice of 
lien refiled during the required refiling period (described in paragraph 
(d) of this section) shall be effective only--
    (i) If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the 
prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was filed under the 
provisions of section 6323; and
    (ii) In any case in which 90 days or more prior to the date the 
refiling of the notice of lien under subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph is completed, the Internal Revenue Service receives written 
information (in the manner described in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph (b)) concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, if a 
notice of such lien is also filed in accordance with section 
6323f)(1)(A)(ii) in the State in which such new residence is located 
(or, if such new residence is located without the United States, in the 
District of Columbia). If on or before such 90th day more than one 
written notice is received concerning a change in the taxpayer's 
residence, a notice of lien is required by this subdivision to be filed 
only with respect to the residence shown on the written notice received 
on the most recent date. This subdivision is applicable regardless of 
whether the taxpayer resides at the new residence on the date the 
refiling of notice of lien under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is 
completed.
    (2) Notice of change of taxpayer's residence--(i) In general. Except 
as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of 
this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be 
effective only if it is received, in writing, by the Internal Revenue 
Service from the taxpayer or his representative, relates to an unpaid 
tax liability of the taxpayer, and states the taxpayer's name and 
address of his new residence. Although it is not necessary that a 
written notice contain the taxpayer's identifying number authorized by 
section 6109, it is preferable that it include such number. For purposes 
of this subdivision, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence shown 
on a return or an amended return (including a return of the same tax) 
will not be effective to notify the Internal Revenue Service.
    (ii) By return or amended return. For purposes of this section, in 
the case of a notice of lien which relates to an assessment of tax made 
after December 31, 1966, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence 
will also be effective if it is contained in a return or amended return 
of the same type of tax filed with the Internal Revenue Service by

[[Page 649]]

the taxpayer which on its face indicates that there is a change in the 
taxpayer's address and correctly states the taxpayer's name, address of 
his new residence, and his identifying number required by section 6109.
    (iii) Other rules applicable. Other than the means specified in 
subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, no communication (either 
written or oral) to the Internal Revenue Service will be considered 
effective as notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence under this 
section, whether or not the Service has actual notice of the taxpayer's 
residence. For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of 
change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the 
notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received 
by the Internal Revenue Service without reference to the provisions of 
section 7502.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State and 
owns real property in N State. Notices of lien are properly filed in M 
and N States. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien 
filed in M State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the 
required refiling period, the notice of lien with the appropriate office 
in M State but is not required to refile the notice of lien with the 
appropriate office in N State. Similarly, in order to continue the 
effect of the notice of lien filed in N State, the Internal Revenue 
Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of 
lien with the appropriate office in N State but is not required to 
refile the notice of lien with the appropriate office in M State.
    Example 2. B, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State. 
Notice of lien is properly filed in that State. One year before the 
required refiling period, B establishes his residence in N State, and B 
immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in 
residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in 
M State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required 
refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in M 
State, and (ii) the appropriate office in N State because B properly 
notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to N 
State more than 89 days prior to the date refiling of the notice of lien 
in M State is completed. If B did not notify the Internal Revenue 
Service of his change in residence to N State in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Internal Revenue 
Service would not be required to file a notice of lien in N State, even 
if the Internal Revenue Service had actual notice of B's change in 
residence to N State. In this latter case, in order to continue the 
effect of the notice of lien filed in M State, the Internal Revenue 
Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of 
lien only with the appropriate office in M State.
    Example 3. C, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of O State. 
Notice of lien is properly filed in that State. Four years before the 
required refiling period, C establishes his residence in P State, and C 
immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in 
residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. Three years before the required refiling period, C establishes 
his residence in R State, and again C immediately notifies the Internal 
Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In order to continue the 
effect of the notice of lien filed in O State, the Internal Revenue 
Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of 
lien with (i) the appropriate office in O State, and (ii) the 
appropriate office in R State since the notice received by the Service 
of C's change in residence to R State was the most recent notice 
received more than 89 days prior to the date refiling in O State is 
completed. The notice of lien is not required to be filed in P State, 
even though C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his 
change in residence to P State, because such notice is not the most 
recent one received.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C does 
not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to R 
State in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in 
O State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required 
refiling period, the notice of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O 
State, and (ii) the appropriate office in P State because C properly 
notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P 
State, even though C is not a resident of P State on the date refiling 
of the notice of lien in O State is completed. The Internal Revenue 
Service is not required to file a notice of lien in R State because C 
did not properly notify the Service of his change in residence to R 
State.
    Example 5. D, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State and 
owns real property in N and O States. The Internal Revenue Service 
properly files notices of lien in M, N, and O States. Five years and 6 
months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, D 
establishes his residence in P State, and at that time the Internal 
Revenue

[[Page 650]]

Service received from D a notification of his change in residence in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. On a 
date which is 5 years and 7 months after the date of the assessment 
shown on the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service properly 
refiles notices of lien in M, N, and O States which refilings continue 
the effect of each of the notices of lien. The Internal Revenue Service 
is not required to file a notice of lien in P State because D did not 
notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P 
State more than 89 days prior to the date each of the refilings in M, N, 
and O States was completed.
    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that the 
refiling of the notice of lien in O State occurs 100 days after D 
notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P 
State in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in 
O State, in addition to refiling the notice of lien in O State, the 
Internal Revenue Service must also file, during the required refiling 
period, a notice of lien in P State because D properly notified the 
Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P State more than 
89 days prior to the date the refiling in O State was completed. 
However, in order to maintain the effect of the refilings in M and N 
States, the Internal Revenue Service is not required to file, during the 
required refiling period, the notice of lien in P State since D did not 
notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P 
State more than 89 days prior to the date the refilings in M and N 
States were completed.
    Example 7. E, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of T State. 
Because T State has not designated one office in the case of personal 
property for filing notices of lien in accordance with the provisions of 
section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii), the Internal Revenue Service properly files a 
notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district 
court. However, solely as a matter of convenience for those who may have 
occasion to search for notices of lien, and not as a matter of legal 
effectiveness, the Internal Revenue Service also files notice of lien 
with the recorder of deeds of the county in T State where E resides. In 
addition, the Internal Revenue Service sent a copy of the notice of lien 
to the X Life Insurance Company to give the Company actual notice of the 
notice of lien. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien, 
the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling 
period, the notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate U.S. 
district court. It is not necessary in order to continue the effect of 
the notice of the lien to refile the notice of lien with the recorder of 
deeds of the county where E resides because the refiling of the notice 
of lien with the recorder of deeds does not constitute a proper filing 
for the purposes of section 6323(f). In addition, it is not necessary to 
continue the effect of the notice of lien under this section to send a 
copy of the notice of lien to the X Life Insurance Company because the 
sending of a notice of lien to an insurance company does not constitute 
a filing for the purposes of section 6323 and, thus, a refiling with an 
insurance company is not required under this section.

    (d) Required refiling period--(1) In general. For the purpose of 
this section, except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
(d), the term ``required refiling period'' means--
    (i) The 1-year period ending 30 days after the expiration of 6 years 
after the date of the assessment of the tax, and
    (ii) The 1-year period ending with the expiration of 6 years after 
the close of the preceding required refiling period for such notice of 
lien.
    (2) Tax assessments made before January 1, 1962. If the assessment 
of the tax is made before January 1, 1962, the first required refiling 
period shall be the calendar year 1967. Thus, to maintain the 
effectiveness of any notice of lien on file which relates to a lien 
which arose before January 1, 1962, the Internal Revenue Service will 
refile the notice of lien during the calendar year 1967. The second 
required refiling period for any such notice of lien is the calendar 
year 1973.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On March 1, 1963, an assessment of tax is made against B, 
a delinquent taxpayer, and a lien for the amount of the assessment 
arises on that date. On July 1, 1963, a notice of lien is properly 
filed. The notice of lien filed on July 1, 1963, is effective up to and 
including March 31, 1969. The first required refiling period for the 
notice of lien begins on April 1, 1968, and ends on March 31, 1969. A 
refiling of the notice of lien during that period will extend the 
effectiveness of the notice of lien filed on July 1, 1963, up to and 
including March 31, 1975. The second required refiling period for the 
notice of lien begins on April 1, 1974, and ends on March 31, 1975.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the 
Internal Revenue Service fails to refile a notice of lien during the 
first required refiling period (Apr. 1, 1968, through Mar. 31, 1969). 
However, a notice of lien which meets the requirements of section 
6323(f) is filed on June 2, 1971. Because of this filing, the notice of 
lien filed on June 2, 1971,

[[Page 651]]

is effective as of June 2, 1971. That notice must itself be refiled 
during the 1-year period ending on March 31, 1975, if it is to continue 
in effect after March 31, 1975. As in example 1, the second required 
refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 1, 1974, and ends 
on March 31, 1975.
    Example 3. On April 1, 1960, an assessment of tax is made against B, 
a delinquent taxpayer, and a tax lien for the amount of the assessment 
arises on that date. On June 1, 1962, a notice of lien is properly 
filed. Because the assessment of tax was made before January 1, 1962, 
the notice of lien filed on June 1, 1962, is effective up to and 
including December 31, 1967. The first required refiling period for the 
notice of lien is the calendar year 1967. A refiling of the notice of 
lien during 1967 will extend the effectiveness of the notice of lien 
filed on June 1, 1962, up to and including December 31, 1973. The second 
required refiling period for the notice of lien is the calendar year 
1973.

<R05>
Sec. 400.2-1   Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale; subordination of lien.

    (a) Scope. This section provides rules under the provisions in 
section 6325(b)(3) which relate to the discharge of property from a tax 
lien by substitution therefor of a lien on the proceeds of the sale of 
the property, and in section 6325(d) which relate to the subordination 
of a tax lien. Section 6325 was amended by section 103(a) of the Federal 
Tax Lien Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1133), effective after November 2, 1966.
    (b) Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale. 
Pursuant to section 6325(b)(3), a district director may, in his 
discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property 
subject to any lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Code if part of the 
property is sold and, pursuant to a written agreement with the district 
director, the proceeds of the sale are held, as a fund subject to the 
lien of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority 
as the liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property. In 
order for the provisions of this paragraph to apply, the sale must 
divest the taxpayer of all right, title, and interest in the property 
sought to be discharged. Any person desiring a certificate of discharge 
under this paragraph shall submit an application in writing to the 
district director responsible for the collection of the tax. The 
application shall contain such information as the district director may 
require. Any reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection 
with the sale of the property and the administration of the sale 
proceeds shall be paid by the applicant or from the proceeds of the sale 
before satisfaction of any claims and liens.
    (c) Subordination of lien--(1) By payment of the amount of 
subordination. Pursuant to section 6325(d)(1), a district director may, 
in his discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of any lien 
imposed under chapter 64 of the Code upon any part of the property 
subject to the lien if there is paid over to the district director an 
amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the 
certificate subordinates the lien of the United States. Under this 
provision, the tax lien may be subordinated to another lien or interest 
on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, if a notice of a Federal tax 
lien is filed and a delinquent taxpayer secures a mortgage on a part of 
the property subject to the tax lien and pays over the amount of the 
principal of the debt secured by the mortgage to a district director 
after an application for a certificate of subordination is approved, the 
district director will issue a certificate of subordination. This 
certificate will have the effect of subordinating the tax lien to the 
mortgage.
    (2) To facilitate tax collection--(i) In general. Pursuant to 
section 6325(d)(2), a district director may, in his discretion, issue a 
certificate of subordination of any lien imposed under chapter 64 of the 
Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien if the district 
director believes that the subordination of the lien will ultimately 
result in an increase in the amount realizable by the United States from 
the property subject to the lien and will facilitate the ultimate 
collection of the tax liability.
    (ii) Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated 
by the following example:

    Example. A, a farmer, needs money in order to harvest his crop. 
However, a Federal tax lien, notice of which has been filed, is 
outstanding with respect to A's property. B, a lending institution is 
willing to make the necessary loan if the loan is secured by a

[[Page 652]]

first mortgage on the farm which is prior to the Federal tax lien. Upon 
examination, the district director believes that ultimately the amount 
realizable from A's property will be increased and the collection of the 
tax liability will be facilitated by the availability of cash when the 
crop is harvested and sold. In this case, the district director may, in 
his discretion, subordinate the tax lien on the farm to the mortgage 
securing the crop harvesting loan.

    (3) Application for certificate of subordination. Any person 
desiring a certificate of subordination under this paragraph shall 
submit an application in writing to the district director responsible 
for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain such 
information as the district director may require.

<R05>
Sec. 400.4-1   Notice required with respect to a nonjudicial sale.

    (a) Scope and application of this section--(1) In general. Section 
109 of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1141) amended the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by adding a new section 7425, relating to 
the discharge of liens. A tax lien of the United States, or a title 
derived from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States, may be 
discharged or divested under local law only in the manner prescribed in 
section 2410 of Title 28 of the United States Code or section 7425 of 
the Internal Revenue Code. Section 7425(a) contains provisions relating 
to the discharge of a lien or a title derived from the enforcement of a 
lien in the judicial proceedings described in subsection (a) of section 
2410 of Title 28 of the United States Code. These judicial proceedings 
are plenary in nature and proceed on formal pleadings. Section 7425(b) 
contains provisions relating to the discharge of a lien or a title 
derived from the enforcement of a lien in the event of a nonjudicial 
sale with respect to the property involved. Section 7425(c) contains 
special rules relating to the notice of sale requirements contained in 
section 7425(b). Paragraph (b) of this section of the regulations 
contains rules with respect to the nonjudicial sales described in 
section 7425(b). Paragraph (c) of this section of the regulations 
contains rules with respect to the notice of sale provisions of section 
7425(c)(1). Paragraph (d) of this section of the regulations contains 
rules relating to the consent to sale provisions of section 7425(c)(2). 
Paragraph (e) of this section of the regulations contains rules relating 
to the sale of perishable goods provisions of section 7425(c)(3). 
Paragraph (f) of this section of the regulations contains the 
requirements with respect to the contents of a notice of sale.
    (2) Effective date of this section. The provisions of section 7425, 
as added by the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, are effective with respect 
to sales occurring after November 2, 1966. The notice of sale provisions 
of section 7425(c) (1) or (3) do not apply to sales occurring after 
November 2, 1966, if the seller of the property performed an act before 
November 3, 1966, which act at the time of performance was required and 
effective under local law with respect to the sale. An example of such 
an act is publication of a notice of the sale in a local newspaper 
before November 3, 1966, if local law requires such publication before a 
sale and the publication is effective under local law. Accordingly, in 
such a case, it is not necessary to notify the Internal Revenue Service 
pursuant to the provisions of section 7425(c) (1) or (3). With respect 
to a notice of sale required under section 7425(c) (1) or (3)--
    (i) Any notice of sale given to an office of the Internal Revenue 
Service or the Treasury Department during the period November 3, 1966, 
through December 21, 1966, shall be considered as adequate;
    (ii) Any notice of sale given during the period December 22, 1966, 
through January 31, 1968, which complies with provisions of either
    (a) Revenue Procedure 67-25, 1967-20 I.R.B. 42 (based on Technical 
Information Release 873, dated December 22, 1966), or
    (b) This section

shall be considered as adequate; and
    (iii) Any notice of sale given after January 31, 1968, which 
complies with the provisions of this section shall be considered as 
adequate.
    (b) Nonjudicial sale--(1) In general. Section 7425(b) contains 
provisions with respect to the effect on the interest of the United 
States in property in

[[Page 653]]

which the United States has or claims a lien, or a title derived from 
the enforcement of a lien, when a sale is made pursuant to--
    (i) An instrument creating a lien on the property sold,
    (ii) A confession of judgment on the obligation secured by an 
instrument creating a lien on the property sold, or
    (iii) A statutory lien on the property sold.

For purposes of this section, such a sale is referred to as a 
``nonjudicial sale.'' The term ``nonjudicial sale'' includes, but is not 
limited to, the divestment of the taxpayer's title to property which 
occurs by operation of law, as well as those which result from a public 
or private sale. Under section 7425(b)(1), if a notice of lien is filed 
in accordance with section 6323(f) or (g), or the title derived from the 
enforcement of a lien is recorded as provided by local law, more than 30 
days before the date of sale, and the appropriate district director is 
not given notice of the sale (in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c) 
of this section), the sale shall be made subject to and without 
disturbing the lien or title of the United States. Under section 
7425(b)(2)(C), in any case in which notice of the sale is given to the 
district director not less than 25 days prior to the date of sale (in 
the manner prescribed in section 7425(c)(1)), the sale shall have the 
same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of the lien or 
title as may be provided by local law with respect to other junior 
liens. A nonjudicial sale pursuant to a lien which is junior to a tax 
lien does not divest the tax lien, even though notice of the nonjudicial 
sale is given to the appropriate district director. However, under the 
provisions of section 6325(b), Sec. 301.6325-1 of this chapter 
(Regulations on Procedure and Administration), and Sec. 400.2-1, a 
district director may discharge the property from a tax lien, including 
a tax lien which is senior to another lien upon the property. In the 
case of a nonjudicial sale subject to the provisions of section 7425(b), 
in order to compute any period of time determined with reference to the 
date of sale, the date of sale shall be determined in accordance with 
the following rules:
    (iv) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting 
directly from a public sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date 
the public sale is held, regardless of the date under local law on which 
junior liens on the property are divested or the title to the property 
is transferred,
    (v) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting 
directly from a private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date 
title to the property is transferred, regardless of the date junior 
liens on the property are divested under local law, and
    (vi) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property not 
resulting directly from a public or private sale, the date of sale is 
deemed to be the date on which junior liens on the property are divested 
under local law.

For provisions relating to the right of redemption of the United States, 
see section 7425(d) and Sec. 400.5-1.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(b), may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Under the law of M State upon entry of judgment, the 
judgment creditor obtains a statutory lien upon the real property of the 
judgment debtor, and certain procedures are provided by which the 
judgment creditor may execute by public sale upon such real property. 
These procedures provide, among other things, for notification by 
personal service or registered or certified mail to other lien 
creditors, if any, and publication of a notice of the sale in a local 
newspaper. After the expiration of a prescribed period of time after 
such notification and publication, the sheriff of the county where the 
real property is located may sell the property at public sale. After 
payment of the amount bid at the public sale, the sheriff issues to the 
purchaser a deed to the real property, and the interests of junior 
lienors in the property are divested. For purposes of this section, such 
an execution sale is a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) 
since the sale is made pursuant to a statutory lien on the property 
sold. The date of sale, for purposes of computing a period of time 
determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the 
public sale is held, since junior liens on the real property are 
divested directly as a result of the public sale. This result obtains 
even though the junior liens are legally divested on a later date when 
the sheriff issues the deed.
    Example 2. Under the law of N State, mortgages on real property may 
contain a power

[[Page 654]]

of sale which authorizes the mortgagee, upon breach by the mortgagor of 
one of the conditions of the mortgage, to have the mortgaged property 
sold at public sale. This public sale must be preceded by notice by 
advertisement in a local newspaper, and the time, place, description of 
the property, and other terms of the sale must be specified. The 
purchaser at such a public sale obtains a title to the real property 
which is not subject to a right of redemption by the mortgagor and which 
divests the interests of the junior lienors in the property. For 
purposes of this section, a sale pursuant to such a power of sale is a 
nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) since the sale is made 
pursuant to the mortgage instrument which created a lien on the property 
sold. The date of the sale, for purposes of computing a period of time 
determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date of the public 
sale since junior liens on the property are divested directly as a 
result of the public sale.
    Example 3. Under the law of O State, upon breach by a mortgagor of 
real property of one of the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgagee 
may foreclose the mortgage by securing possession of the property by one 
of several procedures provided by statute. These procedures are 
generally referred to as ``strict foreclosure.'' In order for a 
foreclosure to be effective under these procedures, a certificate 
attesting the fact of entry must be recorded with the proper registrar 
of deeds within 30 days after the mortgagee enters the property. During 
the 1-year period following the date on which the certificate of entry 
is recorded, the mortgagor or a junior lienor may redeem the property by 
paying the mortgagee the amount of the mortgage obligation. If, during 
such 1-year period the property is not redeemed and the mortgagee's 
possession is continued, the interests of the mortgagor and the junior 
lienors in the property are divested. For purposes of this section, such 
a foreclosure procedure is a nonjudicial sale described in section 
7425(b) since it results in the divestment of the mortgagor's interest 
in the property by operation of law pursuant to the mortgage which 
created a lien on the property. In addition, since there is no public or 
private sale which directly results in the divestment of junior liens on 
the property, the date of sale, for purposes of computing a period of 
time determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date on which 
the 1-year period following the recording of the certificate of entry 
expires.
    Example 4. The law of P State contains a procedure which permits a 
county to collect a delinquent tax assessment with respect to real 
property by the means of a tax sale of the property. First, a notice of 
a public auction with respect to the tax assessment on the real property 
is published in a local newspaper. At the public auction, the purchaser, 
upon payment of the delinquent taxes and interest, obtains from the 
county tax collector a tax certificate with respect to the real 
property. Since the obtaining of this tax certificate does not directly 
result in the divestment of either the owner's title or junior liens 
with respect to the property, the public auction is not a nonjudicial 
sale described in section 7425(b). At any time before a tax deed with 
respect to the property is issued by the clerk of the county court, the 
owner or any holder of a lien or other interest with respect to the 
property may obtain the tax certificate by paying the holder of the tax 
certificate the amount of the taxes, interest, and costs. After a date 
which is two years after the date on which the tax assessment became 
delinquent, the holder of the tax certificate may request the clerk of 
the county court to have the property advertised for sale. After 
advertisement of the sale, the clerk of the county court conducts a 
public sale of the real property and the purchaser obtains a tax deed. 
The interests of all junior lienors in the property are divested and the 
property is not subject to a right of redemption under the law of P 
State. For purposes of this section, this public sale is considered to 
be a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) since the sale is 
made pursuant to a statutory lien on the property sold. The date of the 
sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with 
reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the public sale is 
held at which the purchaser obtains a tax deed as this sale directly 
results in the divestment of junior liens on the property.

    (c) Notice of sale requirements--(1) In general. Except in the case 
of the sale of perishable goods described in paragraph (e) of this 
section, a notice (as described in paragraph (f) of this section) of a 
nonjudicial sale shall be given, in writing by registered or certified 
mail or by personal service, not less than 25 days prior to the date of 
sale (determined under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) (iv), (v), and 
(vi) of this section), to the district director (marked for the 
attention of the chief, special procedures section) for the internal 
revenue district in which the sale is to be conducted. Thus, under this 
section, a notice of sale is not effective if it is given to a district 
director other than the district director for the internal revenue 
district in which the sale is to be conducted. The provisions of 
sections 7502 (relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing) and 
7503 (relating to time for performance

[[Page 655]]

of acts where last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday) 
apply in the case of notices required to be made under this section.
    (2) Postponement of scheduled sale-- (i) Where notice of sale is 
given. In the event that notice of a sale is given in accordance with 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), with respect to a scheduled sale 
which is postponed to a later time or date, the seller of the property 
is required to give notice of the postponement to the district director 
in the same manner as is required under local law with respect to other 
secured creditors. For example, assume that in M State local law 
requires that in the event of a postponement of a scheduled foreclosure 
sale of real property, an oral announcement of the postponement at the 
place and time of the scheduled sale constitutes sufficient notice to 
secured creditors of the postponement. Accordingly, if at the place and 
time of a scheduled sale in M State an oral announcement of the 
postponement is made, the Internal Revenue Service is considered to have 
notice of the postponement for the purpose of this subparagraph.
    (ii) Where notice of sale is not given. In the event that--
    (a) Notice of a nonjudicial sale would not be required under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), if the sale were held on the 
originally scheduled date,
    (b) Because of a postponement of the scheduled sale, more than 30 
days elapse between the originally scheduled date of the sale and the 
date of the sale, and
    (c) A notice of lien with respect to the property to be sold is 
filed more than 30 days before the date of the sale,

notice of the sale is required to be given to the district director in 
accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
(c). In any case in which notice of sale is required to be given with 
respect to a scheduled sale, and notice of the sale is not given, any 
postponement of the scheduled sale does not affect the rights of the 
United States under section 7425(b).
    (iii) Examples. The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A nonjudicial sale of Blackacre, belonging to A, a 
delinquent taxpayer, is scheduled for December 2, 1968. As no notice of 
lien is filed applicable to Blackacre more than 30 days before December 
2, 1968, no notice of sale is given to the district director. On 
December 2, 1968, the sale of Blackacre is postponed until January 15, 
1969. A notice of lien with respect to Blackacre is properly filed on 
January 2, 1969. The sale of Blackacre is held on January 15, 1969. Even 
though more than 30 days elapsed between the originally scheduled date 
of the sale (Dec. 2, 1968) and the date of the sale (Jan. 15, 1969), no 
notice of sale is required to be given to the district director since 
the notice of lien was not filed more than 30 days before the date of 
the sale.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the 
notice of lien is properly filed on November 29, 1968. Since more than 
30 days elapsed between the originally scheduled date of the sale and 
the date of the sale, and the notice of lien is filed (on Nov. 29, 1968) 
more than 30 days before the date of the sale (Jan. 15, 1969), notice of 
the sale, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, is required to be given to the district director.
    Example 3. A nonjudicial sale of Whiteacre, belonging to B, a 
delinquent taxpayer, is scheduled for December 2, 1968. A notice of lien 
applicable to Whiteacre is filed on November 12, 1968. As the notice of 
lien was not filed more than 30 days before December 2, 1968, no notice 
of sale is given to the district director. On December 2, 1968, the sale 
of Whiteacre is postponed until December 20, 1968. The sale of Whiteacre 
is held on December 20, 1968. Even though more than 30 days elapsed 
between the date notice of lien was filed (Nov. 12, 1968) and the date 
of the sale (Dec. 20, 1968), no notice of sale is required to be given 
to the district director since not more than 30 days elapsed between the 
date of the originally scheduled sale (Dec. 2, 1968) and the date the 
sale was actually held (Dec. 20, 1968).

    (d) Consent to sale--(1) In general. Notwithstanding the notice of 
sale provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, a nonjudicial sale of 
property shall discharge or divest the property of the lien or title of 
the United States if the district director for the internal revenue 
district in which the sale occurs consents to the sale of the property 
free of the lien or title. Pursuant to section 7425(c)(2), where 
adequate protection is afforded the lien or title of the United States, 
a district director

[[Page 656]]

may, in his discretion, consent with respect to the sale of property in 
appropriate cases. Such consent shall be effective only if given in 
writing and shall be subject to such limitations and conditions as the 
district director may require. However, a district director may not 
consent to a sale of property under this section after the date of sale, 
as determined under paragraph (b)(1) (iv), (v), and (vi) of this 
section. For provisions relating to the authority of the district 
director to discharge property subject to a tax lien in the case where 
the proceeds of the sale are held as a fund subject to the liens and 
claims of the United States, see section 6325(b)(3) and Sec. 400.2-1.
    (2) Application for consent. Any person desiring a district 
director's consent to sell property free of a tax lien or a title 
derived from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States in the 
property shall submit to the district director for the internal revenue 
district in which the sale is to occur a written application in 
triplicate, declaring it is made under penalties of perjury, requesting 
that such consent be given. The application shall contain the 
information required in the case of a notice of sale, as set forth in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and, in addition, shall contain a 
statement of the reasons why the consent is desired.
    (e) Sale of perishable goods--(1) In general. A notice (as described 
in paragraph (f) of this section) of a nonjudicial sale of perishable 
goods (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (e)) shall be 
given in writing, by registered or certified mail or delivered by 
personal service, at any time before the sale to the district director 
(marked for the attention of the chief, special procedures section) for 
the internal revenue district in which the sale is to be conducted. If a 
notice of a nonjudicial sale is timely given in the manner described in 
this paragraph, the nonjudicial sale shall discharge or divest the tax 
lien, or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien, of the 
United States in the property. The provisions of sections 7502 (relating 
to timely mailing treated as timely filing) and 7503 (relating to time 
for performance of acts where last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday) apply in the case of notices required to be made under 
this paragraph. For example, where the sale of perishable goods is 
scheduled for 1 p.m. on November 1, 1968, and the notice is mailed by 
certified mail to the district director at 10 a.m. on November 1, 1968, 
the notice shall be considered as timely given for purposes of this 
paragraph. The seller of the perishable goods shall hold the proceeds 
(exclusive of costs) of the sale as a fund, for not less than 30 days 
after the date of the sale, subject to the liens and claims of the 
United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the 
liens and claims of the United States had with respect to the property 
sold. If the seller fails to hold the proceeds of the sale in accordance 
with the provisions of this paragraph, the seller shall be personally 
liable to the United States for an amount equal to the value of the 
interest of the United States in the fund. However, even if the proceeds 
of the sale are not so held by the seller, but all the other provisions 
of this paragraph are satisfied, the buyer of the property at the sale 
takes the property free of the liens and claims of the United States. In 
the event of a postponement of the scheduled sale of perishable goods, 
the seller is not required to notify the district director of the 
postponement. For provisions relating to the authority of the district 
director to discharge property subject to a tax lien in the case where 
the proceeds of the sale are held as a fund subject to the liens and 
claims of the United States, see section 6325(b)(3) and Sec. 400.2-1.
    (2) Definition of perishable goods. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, the term ``perishable goods'' means any personal property 
which, in the reasonable view of the person selling the property, is 
liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, 
or cannot be kept without great expense.
    (f) Content of notice of sale--(1) In general. With respect to a 
notice of sale described in paragraph (c) or (e) of this section, the 
notice will be considered adequate if it contains the information 
described in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
subparagraph.
    (i) The name and address of the person submitting the notice of 
sale.

[[Page 657]]

    (ii) A copy of each Notice of Federal Tax Lien (Form 668) affecting 
the property to be sold, or the following information as shown on each 
such Notice of Federal Tax Lien:
    (a) The internal revenue district named thereon,
    (b) The name and address of the taxpayer, and
    (c) The date and place of filing of the notice.
    (iii) With respect to the property to be sold, the following 
information:
    (a) A detailed description, including location, of the property 
affected by the notice (in the case of real property, the street 
address, city, and State and the legal description contained in the 
title or deed to the property and, if available, a copy of the abstract 
of title);
    (b) The date, time, place, and terms of the proposed sale of the 
property; and
    (c) In the case of a sale of perishable property described in 
paragraph (e) of this section, a statement of the reasons why the 
property is believed to be perishable.
    (iv) The approximate amount of the principal obligation, including 
interest, secured by the lien sought to be enforced and a description of 
the other expenses (such as legal expenses, selling costs, etc.) which 
may be charged against the sale proceeds.
    (2) Inadequate notice. Except as otherwise provided in this 
subparagraph, a notice of sale described in paragraph (c) of this 
section which does not contain the information described in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph (f), will not be considered adequate by a district 
director. If a district director determines that the notice is 
inadequate, he will give written notification of the items of 
information which are inadequate to the person who submitted the notice. 
In such event a notice complying with the provisions of this section 
(including the requirement that the notice be given 25 days prior to the 
sale in the case of a notice described in paragraph (c) of this section) 
must be given. However, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, in such a case the district director may, in his 
discretion, consent to the sale of the property free of the lien or 
title of the United States even though notice of the sale is not given 
25 days prior to the sale. In any case in which the person who submitted 
a timely notice does not receive, more than 5 days prior to the date of 
the sale, written notification from the district director that the 
notice is inadequate, the notice shall be considered adequate for the 
purposes of this section.
    (3) Acknowledgment of notice. If a notice of sale described in 
paragraph (c) or (e) of this section is submitted in duplicate to the 
district director with a written request that receipt of the notice be 
acknowledged and returned to the person giving the notice, this request 
will be honored by the district director. The acknowledgment by the 
district director will indicate the date and time of the receipt of the 
notice.
    (4) Disclosure of adequacy of notice. The district director for the 
internal revenue district in which the sale was held is authorized to 
disclose, to any person who has a proper interest, whether an adequate 
notice of sale was given under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f). 
Any person desiring this information should submit to the district 
director a written request which clearly describes the property sold, 
identifies the applicable notice of lien, gives the reasons for 
requesting the information, and states the name and address of the 
person making the request.

<R05>
Sec. 400.5-1   Redemption by United States.

    (a) Scope. The purpose of this section is to prescribe rules with 
respect to the provisions contained in section 7425(d), relating to 
redemption of real property by the United States. Section 109 of the 
Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1141) amended the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954 by adding a new section 7425, relating to the 
discharge of tax liens, effective after November 2, 1966.
    (b) Right to redeem--(1) In general. In the case of a nonjudicial 
sale of real property to satisfy a lien prior to the tax lien, the 
district director may redeem the property within the redemption period 
(as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)). The right of 
redemption of the United

[[Page 658]]

States exists under section 7425(d) even though the district director 
has consented to the sale under section 7425(c)(2) and paragraph (d) of 
Sec. 400.4-1. For purposes of this section, the term ``nonjudicial 
sale'' shall have the same meaning as when used in paragraph (b)(1) of 
Sec. 400.4-1.
    (2) Redemption period. For purposes of this section, the redemption 
period shall be--
    (i) The period beginning with the date of the sale (as determined 
under paragraph (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (vi) of Sec. 400.4-1) and ending 
with the 120th day after such date, or
    (ii) The period for redemption of real property allowable, with 
resepct to other secured creditors, under local law of the place where 
the real property is located,

whichever is longer.

    (3) Limitations. In the event a sale does not ultimately discharge 
the property from the tax lien (whether by reason of local law or the 
provisions of section 7425(b)), the provisions of this section do not 
apply since the tax lien will continue to attach to the property after 
the sale. In a case in which the Internal Revenue Service is not 
entitled to a notice of sale under section 7425(b) and Sec. 400.4-1, the 
United States does not have a right of redemption under secton 7425(d). 
However, in such a case, if a tax lien has attached to the property at 
the time of sale, the United States has the same right of redemption, if 
any, which is afforded to any secured creditor under the local law of 
the place in which the property is situated.
    (c) Amount to be paid--(1) In general. In any case in which a 
district director exercises the right to redeem real property, the 
amount to be paid is the sum of the following amounts--
    (i) The actual amount paid for the property being redeemed (which, 
in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being 
foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such 
lien to the extent legally satisfied by reason of the sale);
    (ii) Interest on the amount paid (described in subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph) at the sale by the purchaser of the real property 
computed at the rate of 6 percent per annum for the period from the date 
of the sale (as determined under paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (vi) of 
Sec. 400.4-1) to the date of redemption; and
    (iii) The amount, if any, equal to the excess of (a) the expenses 
necessarily incurred in connection with such property by the purchaser, 
over (b) the income from such property realized by the purchaser plus a 
reasonable rental value of such property (to the extent the property is 
used by or with the consent of the purchaser, or is rented at less than 
its reasonable rental value).
    (2) Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this 
paragraph (b), may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a delinquent taxpayer, owns Blackacre located in X 
State upon which B holds a mortgage. After the mortgage is properly 
recorded, a notice of tax lien is filed which is applicable to 
Blackacre. Subsequently, A defaults on the mortgage and B forecloses on 
the mortgage which has an outstanding obligation in the amount of 
$100,000. At the foreclosure sale, B bids $50,000 and obtains title to 
Blackacre as a result of the sale. At the time of the foreclosure sale, 
Blackacre has a fair market value of $75,000. Under the laws of X State, 
the mortgage obligation is fully satisfied as a result of the 
foreclosure sale and the mortgagee cannot obtain a deficiency judgment. 
Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, the district director must 
pay $100,000 in order to redeem Blackacre.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that under 
the laws of X State, the fair market value of the property foreclosed is 
the amount of the obligation legally satisfied as a result of the 
foreclosure sale, and in a case in which the amount of the obligation 
exceeds the amount of the fair market value of the property, the 
mortgagee has the right to a judgment for the deficiency computed as the 
difference between the obligation and the fair market value of the 
property. In such a case the district director must, under subparagraph 
(1)(i) of this paragraph, pay $75,000 in order to redeem Blackacre, 
whether or not B seeks a judgment for the deficiency.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that under 
the laws of X State, the amount bid is the amount of the obligation 
legally satisfied as a result of the foreclosure sale, and in the case 
in which the amount of the obligation exceeds the amount bid, the 
mortgagee has the right to a judgment for the deficiency computed as the 
difference between the amount of the obligation and the amount bid. In 
such a case, the

[[Page 659]]

district director must under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, pay 
$50,000 in order to redeem Blackacre, whether or not B seeks a judgment 
for the deficiency.

    (d) Certificate of redemption--(1) In general. If a district 
director exercises the right of redemption of the United States 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, he shall apply to the 
officer designated by local law, if any, for the documents necessary to 
evidence the fact of redemption and to record title to the redeemed 
property in the name of the United States. If no such officer has been 
designated by local law or if the officer designated by local law fails 
to issue the necessary documents, the district director is authorized to 
issue a certificate of redemption for the property redeemed by the 
United States.
    (2) Filing. The district director shall, without delay, cause either 
the documents issued by the local officer or the certificate of 
redemption executed by the district director, described in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph (d), to be duly recorded in the proper registry of 
deeds. If a certificate of redemption is issued by the district director 
and if the State in which the real property redeemed by the United 
States is situated has not by law designated an office in which the 
certificate of redemption may be recorded, the district director shall 
file the certificate of redemption in the office of the clerk of the 
U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the redeemed 
property is situated.
    (3) Effect of certificate of redemption. A certificate of redemption 
executed pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (d), shall 
constitute prima facie evidence of the regularity of the redemption. 
When a certificate of redemption is recorded, it shall transfer to the 
United States all the rights, title, and interest in and to the redeemed 
property acquired by the person from whom the district director redeemed 
the property by virtue of the sale of the property.
    (4) Application for release of right of redemption. Upon application 
of a party with a proper interest in the real property sold in a 
nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) and paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 400.4-1, which real property is subject to the right of redemption 
of the United States described in this section, the district director 
may, in his discretion, release the right of redemption with respect to 
the property. The application for the release shall be submitted in 
writing to a district director and shall contain such information as the 
district director may require. If the district director determines that 
the right of redemption of the United States is without value, no amount 
shall be required to be paid with respect to the release of the right of 
redemption.

PART 401--TEMPORARY PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS UNDER THE TAX EQUITY AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1982 (PUB. L. 97-248)--Table of Contents

<R05>



<R05>
Sec. 401.6325-1  Release of liens.

    (a) In general. The district director shall issue a certificate of 
release for a filed notice of Federal tax lien not later than 30 days 
after the date on which the district director finds that the entire tax 
liability listed in such notice of Federal tax lien has been fully 
satisfied (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) or has become 
legally unenforceable.
    (b) Certificate of release for a lien which has become legally 
unenforceable. The district director shall have the authority to file a 
notice of Federal tax lien which also contains a certificate of release 
pertaining to those liens which become legally unenforceable. Such 
release will become effective as a release as of a date prescribed in 
the document containing the notice of Federal tax lien and certificate 
of release.
    (c) Satisfaction of tax liability. For purposes of paragraph (a) of 
this section, satisfaction of the tax liability occurs when--
    (1) The district director determines that the entire tax liability 
listed in a notice of Federal tax lien has been fully satisfied. Such 
determination will be made as soon as practicable after tender of 
payment; or
    (2) The taxpayer provides the district director with proof of full 
payment (as

[[Page 660]]

defined in paragraph (d) of this section) with respect to the entire tax 
liability listed in a notice of Federal tax lien together with the 
information and documents set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. 
See paragraph (e) of this section if more than one tax liability is 
listed in a notice of Federal tax lien.
    (d) Proof of full payment. As used in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the term ``proof of full payment'' means--
    (1) An internal revenue cashier's receipt reflecting full payment of 
the tax liability in question;
    (2) A canceled check in an amount sufficient to satisfy the tax 
liability for which the release is being sought; or
    (3) Any other manner of proof acceptable to the district director.
    (e) Notice of a Federal tax lien which lists multiple liabilities. 
When a notice of Federal tax liens lists multiple tax liabilities, the 
district director shall issue a certificate of release when all of the 
tax liabilities listed in the notice of Federal tax lien have been fully 
satisfied or have become legally unenforceable. In addition, if the 
taxpayer requests that a certificate of release be issued with respect 
to one or more tax liabilities listed in the notice of Federal tax lien 
and such liability has been fully satisfied or has become legally 
unenforceable, the district director shall issue a certificate of 
release. For example, if a notice of Federal tax lien lists two separate 
liabilities and one of the liabilities is satisfied, the taxpayer may 
request the issuance of a certificate of release with respect to the 
satisfied tax liability and the district director shall issue a release. 
See paragraph (c) of this section in determining when a tax lien has 
been fully satisfied. A request made by the taxpayer shall be made to 
the district director in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (f) Taxpayer requests. A request for a certificate of release with 
respect to a notice of Federal tax lien shall be submitted in writing to 
the district director (marked for the attention of the Chief, Special 
Procedures Function) of the district in which the notice of Federal tax 
lien was filed. The request shall contain the following--
    (1) Name and address of the taxpayer;
    (2) A copy of the notice of Federal tax lien affecting the property; 
and
    (3) The grounds upon which the issuance of a release is sought.
    (g) Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective 
with respect to a notice of Federal tax lien (1) which is filed after 
December 31, 1982,
    (2) which is satisfied after December 31, 1982, or
    (3) with respect to which the taxpayer after December 31, 1982, 
requests that district director to issue a certificate of release on the 
grounds that the liability was satisfied or legally unenforceable.

otherwise provided in this section.

which is forfeitable under the internal revenue laws and this part and 
which in his opinion is valued at $2,500.00 or less, he shall cause a

Sec. 403.30   Special disposition of perishable goods.

    The proceedings to enforce forfeiture of perishable goods shall, as 
is the case with proceedings to enforce forfeiture of nonperishable 
goods, be in the nature of proceedings in rem in the United States 
District Court for the district wherein such seizure is made. When any 
seized property is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price 
or value by keeping, or when it cannot be kept without great expense, 
the Commissioner or his delegate shall advise the owner, when known, of 
the seizure thereof. The owner of the seized property may apply to the 
District Director of the internal revenue district in which the property 
was seized to examine the property at any time prior to referral of the 
property to the U.S. Marshal for disposition. If, in the opinion of the 
Commissioner or his delegate it is necessary that such property be sold 
to prevent waste or expense, the Commissioner or his delegate shall 
cause the property to be appraised in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in Sec. 403.26(a)(2). The owner shall have such property returned 
to him upon giving a corporate surety bond pursuant to Sec. 403.28 in an 
amount equal to the appraised value of the property, to abide the final 
order, decree, or judgment of the court having cognizance of the case. 
The bond shall be conditioned to pay the amount of the appraised value 
to the Commissioner or his delegate, the U.S. Marshal, or otherwise, as 
may be ordered and directed by the court. The bond shall be filed by the 
Commissioner or his delegate with the U.S. Attorney for the district in 
which the proceedings may be commenced. If the owner of such property 
neglects or refuses to give such bond within a reasonable time 
considering the condition of the property, the Commissioner or his 
delegate shall request the U.S. Marshal to proceed to sell the property 
at public sale as soon as practicable and to pay the proceeds of sale, 
less reasonable costs of the seizure and sale, to the court to abide its 
final order, decree, or judgment.

(Sec. 7322, 7323, 7324, 68A Stat. 869, 870, as amended; (26 U.S.C. 7322,

    Remission or mitigation of forfeitures shall be governed by the 
customs laws applicable to remission or mitigation of penalties as

<R05>
Sec. 403.36   Interest claimed.

    Any person claiming an interest in property seized by an officer of 
the Internal Revenue Service as subject to administrative forfeiture 
under this part may file a petition addressed to

[[Page 664]]

the District Director of the internal revenue district in which the 
property was seized for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture of 
such property.


<R05>
Sec. 403.37   Form of the petition.

    There is no standardized form provided or required by the Department 
of the Treasury for use in filing a petition for remission or mitigation 
of forfeiture. However, the petition should be typewritten on legal size 
paper; and must be executed under oath, prepared in triplicate, and 
addressed to the District Director of the internal revenue district in 
which the property was seized. All copies of original documents 
submitted as exhibits in support of allegations of the petition should 
be certified as true and accurate copies of originals. Each copy of the 
petition must contain a complete set of exhibits.


<R05>
Sec. 403.38   Contents of the petition.

    (a) Description of the property. The petition should contain such a 
description of the property and such facts of the seizure as will enable 
the Commissioner or his delegate to identify the property.
    (b) Statement regarding knowledge of seizure. In the event the 
petition is filed for the restoration of the proceeds derived from sale 
of the property pursuant to an administrative forfeiture, it should 
contain, or be supported by, satisfactory proof that the petitioner did 
not know and could not have known of the seizure prior to the 
declaration of forfeiture. (See also Sec. 403.39)
    (c) Interest of petitioner. The petition should clearly and 
concisely indicate the nature and amount of his interest in the property 
on the date the petition is filed, and the facts relied upon to show 
that the petitioner was not willfully negligent and did not intend that 
the property be involved or used in violation of the internal revenue 
laws. Such petition may allege such other circumstances which in the 
opinion of the petitioner would justify the remission or mitigation of 
the forfeiture.
    (d) Petitioner innocent party. If the petitioner did not commit the 
act which caused the seizure of his property, the petition should state 
how the property came into the possession of the person whose act did 
cause the seizure, and it should also state that the petitioner had no 
knowledge or reason to believe that the property would be involved or 
used in violation of the internal revenue laws. If the petitioner knows, 
at the time he files the petition, that the person in whose possession 
the seized property was at the time of the seizure had a record or 
reputation for committing commercial crimes, the petitioner should state 
in the petition whether the petitioner knew of such record or reputation 
before the petitioner acquired his interest in the property or before 
such other person came into possession of the property, whichever 
occured later. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``commercial 
crimes'' includes, but is not limited to any of the following federal or 
state crimes:
    (1) Offenses against the revenue laws; burglary; counterfeiting, 
forgery; kidnapping; larceny; robbery; illegal sale or possession of 
deadly weapons; prostitution (including soliciting, procuring, 
pandering, white slaving, keeping house of ill fame, and like offenses); 
extortion; swindling and confidence games; and attempting to commit, 
conspiring to commit, or compounding any of the foregoing crimes. 
Addiction to narcotic drugs and use of marijuana will be treated as 
commercial crimes.
    (e) Documents supporting claim. The petition should be accompanied 
by copies, certified by the petitioner under oath as correct, of 
contracts, bills of sale, chattel mortgages, reports of investigators or 
credit reporting agencies, affidavits, and any other documents that 
would support the claims made in the petition.
    (f) Costs. The petition should contain an undertaking to pay any 
costs assessed as a condition of allowance of the petition. Such costs 
include but are not limited to all expenses incurred in seizing and 
storing the property; the costs borne or to be borne by the United 
States; the taxes, if any, payable by the petitioner or imposed in 
respect of the property to which the petition relates; the penalty, if 
any, asserted by the Internal Revenue Service; and, if the property has 
been sold, or is in the course of being sold, the expenses incurred 
relating to such sale.

[[Page 665]]


<R05>
Sec. 403.39   Time of filing petition.

    A complete petition for remission or mitigation must be filed before 
the expiration of three months after the sale or other disposition of 
the property with respect to which the petition is filed. For purposes 
of this part, the term ``sale or other disposition'' includes 
acquisition of the property for official use.

Sec. 403.42   Return of defective petition.

    If the petition is defective in some correctable respect, the 
original of the petition will be returned by letter to the petitioner 
who will be allowed to submit a corrected petition, in triplicate, 
within a reasonable time.


<R05>
Sec. 403.43   Final action.

    (a) Petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture. (1) The 
Commissioner or his delegate shall either allow or deny any petition 
filed pursuant to these regulations. Such allowance or denial will 
constitute final action. If he allows the petition, the Commissioner or 
his delegate shall state the conditions, if any, of the allowance.
    (2) If he allows the petition, the Commissioner or his delegate may 
order the property returned to the petitioner, sold for the account of 
the petitioner, or, pursuant to agreement with the petitioner, acquired 
for official use.
    (3) The Commissioner or his delegate shall notify the petitioner of 
the allowance or denial of the petition and, in the case of allowance, 
the conditions, if any, under which the Commissioner or his delegate 
allowed the petition.
    (b) Offers in compromise of liability to forfeiture. The 
Commissioner or his delegate shall accept or reject any offer in 
compromise of the liability to forfeiture of personal property seized 
pursuant to Sec. 403.25 and such acceptance or rejection shall be a 
final action with respect to the offer.


<R05>
Sec. 403.44   Acquisition for official use and sale for account of petitioner in the case of an allowed petition.

    (a) Acquisition for official use. The seized property may be 
purchased by the United States pursuant to agreement and retained for 
official use. Where the petitioner is the owner, the purchase price is 
the appraised value of the property less all costs. Where the petitioner 
is a creditor, the purchase price is the smaller of:
    (1) The petitioner's equity, or (2) the appraised value of the 
property less the amount of all costs.
    (b) Sale for account of petitioner. If the petitioner elects not to 
comply with the conditions, if any, set for the return of the property, 
the Commissioner or his delegate is authorized to sell the property. If 
the petitioner is the owner of the property, there is deducted from the 
proceeds of the sale all costs incident to the seizure, forfeiture, and 
sale. The Commissioner or his delegate shall pay to the petitioner, out 
of the proper appropriation, an amount equal to the balance, if any. 
Where the petitioner is a creditor, there is deducted from the proceeds 
of the sale all costs incident to the seizure, forfeiture, and sale, and 
the Commissioner or his delegate shall pay to the petitioner, out of the 
proper appropriation, an amount equal to the smaller of: (1) The 
balance, if any, or (2) the equity of the petitioner.


<R05>
Sec. 403.45   Re-appraisal of property involved in an allowed petition.

    In determining the nature and extent of the relief to be afforded a 
petitioner pursuant to Sec. 403.44 the value of the property with 
respect to which the petition has been allowed is the value of such 
property as determined by the appraisal thereof made pursuant to 
Sec. 403.26(a)(2) but if the petitioner desires re-appraisal of the 
property, after notification as to the conditions of allowances of the 
petition, and makes

[[Page 666]]

written request therefor, undertaking in such request to pay, or to be 
liable for, the total costs of such re-appraisal, the property shall be 
re-appraised in the manner in which the original appraisal was made, and 
the conditions of allowance of the petition shall be modified to the 
extent required by such re-appraisal.


<R04>
                       Subpart E--Appraiser's fees


<R05>
Sec. 403.50  Rate of compensation.

    Each appraiser selected under Sec. 403.26(a)(2) shall receive as 
compensation a reasonable fee not to exceed $15.00 per hour or portion 
thereof for the performance of such appraiser's duties in appraising 
property seized as subject to forfeiture under the internal revenue laws 
and this part.

Because this regulation is nonsubstantive, liberalizing and essentially 
procedural, it is found unnecessary to issue it with notice and public 
procedure under subsection (b) of section 553 of Title 5 of the United 
States Code or subject to the effective date limitation of subsection 
(d) of that section.

           Subpart F--Administrative Sale of Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 403.55   Alternative methods of sale.

    When personal property forfeited administratively is to be sold, the 
Commissioner or his delegate shall cause a notice of sale to be placed 
in a newspaper of general circulation published in the judicial district 
wherein the seizure was made. The sale shall occur not less than 10 days 
from the date of the publication of the notice. At the discretion of the 
Commissioner or his delegate the forfeited personal property may be sold 
at public auction to the highest bidder on open, competitive bids, or 
sold to the highest bidder on sealed, competitive bids.

(Sec. 7325, 68A Stat. 870, as amended; (26 U.S.C. 7325))


<R05>
Sec. 403.56   All bids on unit basis.

    All competitive bids shall be on a unit basis. Thus, for example, if 
a number of forfeited automobiles are advertised for sale at the same 
date, hour and place, whether or not in the same notice of sale, a 
separate individual bid is required as to each automobile. The 
Commissioner or his delegate will not accept one blanket bid to cover 
the entire group of automobiles offered for sale.


<R05>
Sec. 403.57   Conditions of sale.

    (a) No recourse. All personal property to be sold shall be offered 
for sale ``as is'' and without recourse against the United States.
    (b) No guarantee. No guarantee or warranty, expressed or implied, 
shall be given or understood in respect of any forfeited property 
offered for sale.
    (c) No sale. (1) The United States reserves the right to reject any 
bids.
    (2) In a case in which all bids are rejected the Commissioner or his 
delegate shall re-advertise the property for sale in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 403.55.
    (d) One bid. When only one bid is received for a single unit of 
property such bid shall be the highest bid received for such property.

(Sec. 7325, 68A Stat. 870, as amended (26 U.S.C. 7325 (1), (4)); sec.

<R05>
Sec. 403.58   Acceptable forms of payment.

    The only acceptable forms of payment shall be cash, cashier's check, 
certified check, or postal money order, in the amount of the accepted 
bid.
Sec. 403.59  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 403.60   Purchaser entitled to bill of sale.

    Each purchaser of administratively forfeited property is entitled to 
receive a suitable bill of sale.


<R05>
Sec. 403.61   Sale on open, competitive bids.

    If forfeited property is to be sold at public auction to the highest 
bidder on open, competitive bids, the notice of sale shall so specify, 
and state the date, hour, and place of such sale.

[[Page 667]]


<R05>
Sec. 403.62   Sale on sealed, competitive bids.

    If the property is to be sold to the highest bidder on sealed, 
competitive bids, the notice of sale shall so specify, and shall state 
the date, hour, and place of sale, and the date, hour, and place prior 
to the sale when and where prospective bidders may view the property and 
obtain necessary information. All sealed bids must be filed with the 
district director of the internal revenue district in which the property 
was seized before the sale. No bids will be accepted after the sale 
starts. At the appointed date, hour, and place of sale, all sealed bids 
timely filed shall be open in the presence of all bidders attending the 
sale, who shall have the privilege of inspecting the bids if they so 
desire.


<R04>
      Subpart G--Disposal of Forfeited Coin-Operated Gaming Devices


<R05>
Sec. 403.65   Authority for destruction.

    The Commissioner or his delegate is authorized to order the 
destruction of any coin-operated gaming device as defined in I.R.C. 
section 4462 upon which a tax is imposed by I.R.C. section 4461, after 
the expiration of three months from the date of consummation of 
administrative forfeiture under any provision of I.R.C.

<R05>
Sec. 404.6048-1  Annual returns for foreign trusts with a United States beneficiary.

    (a) Return required--(1) In general. Each taxpayer subject to tax 
under section 679 with respect to a foreign trust having one or more 
United States beneficiaries must file Form 3520-A, Annual Return of 
Foreign Trust with U.S. Beneficiaries, together with any additional 
schedules or other information required by the form or the instructions 
to the form. Form 3520-A must be filed even if the taxpayer is treated 
as the owner of a foreign trust under both section 679 and some other 
provision of Subpart E of Part I of Subchapter J.
    (2) Joint returns. If the taxpayer's spouse is also subject to tax 
under section 679 with respect to the same foreign trust for the same 
taxable year, and if both taxpayer and spouse file a joint return of 
income tax for that year, a single Form 3520-A may be filed jointly with 
respect to such trust for the year.
    (b) Period covered by return. The period covered by the return 
required by this section is the taxable year of the taxpayer required to 
file the return, regardless of the period used by the trust for 
accounting or any other purpose.
    (c) Time for filing--(1) In general. The return required by this 
section must be filed no later than the 15th day of the fourth month 
following the end of the taxable period covered by the return.
    (2) Transitional rule. In the case of a return required by this 
section for a taxable period ending on or before June 30, 1977, the 
return must be filed no later than--
    (i) October 15, 1977, in the case of a taxpayer treated as an owner 
with respect to the trust under both section 679 and a provision of 
sections 672 through 678, or
    (ii) December 31, 1977, in all other cases.
    (3) Extensions of time for filing. For rules relating to extensions

<R05>
Sec. 404.6334(d)-1  Minimum exemption from levy for wages, salary, or other income.

    (a) In general. Under section 6331(a), if an individual liable for 
any tax neglects or refuses to pay such tax within 10 days after notice 
and demand, the tax may be collected by levy upon property or rights to 
property belonging to such individual, including amounts payable to or 
received by him as wages, salary, or other income. Under section 
6331(d)(3), a levy upon wages or salary is continuous from the date the 
levy is first made until the liability giving rise to the levy is 
satisfied or becomes unforceable by reason of lapse of time. Under 
section 6334(a)(9), however, certain amounts payable to or received by 
an individual as wages or salary for personal services, or as income 
from other sources, are exempt from levy. Under section 6334(d), amounts 
so exempt are determined by taking into account (1) the individual's 
payroll period, i.e., the basis (whether weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, 
monthly or otherwise) on which the individual is paid or receives wages, 
salary, or other income, and (2) the number of certain other persons 
dependent upon the individual for their support during each such payroll 
period. Paragraph (b) of this section prescribes rules for determining 
an individual's payroll period. Paragraph (c) of this section contains 
rules relating to the minimum amount of wages, salary, or other income 
which is exempt from levy for each such payroll period, and the 
additional amount which is exempt for each person who is claimed as a 
dependent of the individual pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Determination of payroll period. For purposes of determining the 
amount of wages, salary, or other income exempt from levy pursuant to 
section 6334(a)(9) and this section--
    (1) Regularly used calendar periods. In the case of a levy on wages, 
etc. paid on the basis of an established calendar period regularly used 
by the employer for payroll purposes (e.g., weekly, biweekly, 
semimonthly, or monthly), that period shall be used as the individual's 
payroll period.
    (2) Remuneration paid on an irregular basis. In the case of a levy 
on wages, etc. not paid on the basis of an established calendar period 
regularly used by an employer for payroll purposes, the first day of the 
individual's payroll period shall be that day following the day upon 
which the wages, salary, or other income become payable to or are 
received by the individual, and the last day of the payroll period shall 
be that day upon which such wages, salary, or other income next become 
payable to or are received by him.
    (c) Determination of exempt amount. For each payroll period 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, amounts exempt 
from levy pursuant to section 6334(a)(9) and this section are as 
follows:
    (1) If such payroll period is weekly: $50, plus $15 for each person 
who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) If such payroll period is biweekly: $100, plus $30 for each 
person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (3) If such payroll period is semimonthly: $108.33, plus $32.50 for 
each person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (4) If such payroll period is monthly: $216.67, plus $65 for each 
person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (5) If such payroll period is not weekly, biweekly, semimonthly or 
monthly: a proportionate amount based upon the sum of an annual 
exemption of $2,600 plus $780 for each person who is claimed as a 
dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Dependent exemption. (1) Dependent defined. For purposes of this 
section, a person is a dependent of an individual for any payroll period 
of such individual, if--
    (i) Over half of such person's support for such payroll period was 
received from the individual, and
    (ii) Such person is the spouse of the individual, or bears a 
relationship to the individual specified in section 152(a) (1) through 
(9) (relating to definition of dependent), and
    (iii) Such person is not a minor child of the individual with 
respect to whom amounts are exempt from levy under

[[Page 669]]

section 6334(a)(8) (relating to exemption from levy for judgments for 
support of minor children) at any time during such payroll period.

For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, ``payroll 
period'' shall be substituted for ``taxable year'' each place it appears 
in section 152(a)(9).
    (2) Claim for dependent exemption. No amount prescribed by paragraph 
(c) of this section as being exempt from levy for each person who is 
claimed as a dependent pursuant to this paragraph shall be so exempt 
unless there is delivered to the employer or other person upon whom 
notice of levy is served a written statement, signed by the individual 
seeking such exemption and containing a declaration that it is made 
under the penalties of perjury, which identifies, by name and by 
relationship to such individual, each person for whom a dependent 
exemption is claimed.
    (e) Cross references. (1) For the requirement for notice of intent 
to levy on salary or wages, see section 6331(d)(1).
    (2) For the continuing effect of a levy on salary or wages, see 
section 6331(d)(3).
    (3) For other property exempt from levy, see section 6334 and 
Sec. 301.6334-1.
    (f) Effective date: The regulations prescribed by this section shall 
apply with respect to levies on wages, salary, and other income made 
after February 28, 1977.

Sec. 420.0-1  Certain existing plans may elect new provisions.

    (a) In general. The plan administrator (as defined in section 
414(g)) of a plan that was in existence on January 1, 1974, may elect to 
have the provisions of the Code relating to participation, vesting, 
funding, and form of benefit (as in effect from time to time) apply to a 
plan year selected by the plan administrator which begins after 
September 2, 1974, but before the otherwise applicable effective dates 
determined under section 1017 (b) or (c), 1021, or 1024 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and to all subsequent plan 
years. The provisions referred to are the amendments to the Code made by 
sections 1011, 1012, 1013, 1015, 1016(a) (1) through (11) and (13) 
through (27), 1021, and 1022(b) of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974.
    (b) Election is irrevocable. Any election made under this section, 
once made, shall be irrevocable.
    (c) Procedure and time for making election. An election under this 
section shall be made by attaching a statement to either the annual 
return required under section 6058(a) (or an amended return) with 
respect to the plan which is filed for the first plan year for which the 
election is effective or to a written request for a determination letter 
relating to the qualification of the plan under section 401 (a), 403(a), 
or 405(a) of the Code and, if trusteed, the exempt status under section 
501(a) of the Code of a trust constituting a part of the plan. If the 
election is made with a written request for a determination letter, the 
election may be conditioned upon issuance of a favorable determination 
letter, and will become irrevocable upon issuance of such letter. The 
statement shall indicate that the election is made under section 1017 
(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the first 
plan year for which the election is effective.
